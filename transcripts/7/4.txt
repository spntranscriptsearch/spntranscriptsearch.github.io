NOW
EXT. DEARBORN, MICHIGAN – NIGHT


A MAN is running through the streets, chased by a car. He ducks into a laneway while the car continues along the road, and stands breathing heavily and clutching his chest. He looks behind him and sees nothing. When he turns around again, the car is facing him.


MAN
That's impossible.


The car accelerates towards the MAN. He turns and runs, with the car close behind. He enters the door of an apartment building, runs up the stairs to at least the 9th floor and lets himself in to an apartment, where he leans against a wall panting.


MAN
You’re okay, you’re okay. Oh, you’re okay.


The MAN hears the sound of an engine revving and turns around in alarm. The car accelerates towards him and crushes him against the wall.


MAN
No!


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. DEARBORN, MICHIGAN – DAY


SAM and DEAN pull up to a crime scene and get out of the IMPALA.


LUCIFER (in SAM’s mind)
Sam.


SAM presses his right thumb into his left hand, which he cut in 7.01 Meet the New Boss.


DEAN
Feels wonky.


SAM
What?


DEAN
Working a regular job.


SAM
Bobby'll call if anything flares up on the Leviathan front. In the meantime, you know you want to work this case, Dean. Cop on the wire sounded dumbfounded.


DEAN
No arguments. It's kind of nice, you know? We're due for a little cut and dry. And, uh...


SAM and DEAN hold up FBI badges and a policeman lets them through the “Do Not Cross” line.


DEAN
You seem good.


SAM
I am. For me. By the way... Thank you.


DEAN
For?


SAM
Amy. I know you didn't want to let her go, but it was the right thing to do. So, thanks.


DEAN
No problem.


INT. MAN’S APARTMENT – DAY


SAM and DEAN show their ID again and duck under another “Do Not Cross” line.


DETECTIVE
Welcome to Crazytown, population – one dead guy.


SAM
Who was he?


DETECTIVE
Uh, Matthew Hammond. Seems to have been crushed to death.


DEAN
By?


DETECTIVE
Well, if we weren't on the tenth floor, I'd say by a car.


A police photographer takes a picture of a bloodstained brick wall with a hole knocked through it. SAM takes out his EMF reader.


SAM
It's going crazy.


DEAN
Some kind of ghost?


DEAN
With a license? License to kill.


SAM
Seriously? Huh.


DEAN
What do you got?


SAM
I don't know. Looks like some kind of powder.


DEAN
Sulfur?


SAM
No. Just dirt. Could be "Christine"-like.


DEAN
Ugh. Even possessed cars can't do stairs. It's something spectral.


DEAN picks up a token from a bowl of knick-knacks.


DEAN
Check this out. "AA, 10 years." Dead and sober.


DEAN tosses the token to SAM.


DEAN
Double crappy.


SAM is looking at some papers.


SAM
There's a charge keeps coming up. 50 bucks a month at a place called Jane's. All right. Congrats on your sobriety.


SAM tosses the token back to DEAN.


SAM
I'll go find out what Jane's is.


DEAN
I gave up AA for Lent.


SAM
We're not Catholic.


DEAN
Always with the details. AA gives me the jeebs.


SAM
Wow. Shocker.


DEAN
Shut up.


SAM
Fine. I'll hit the meeting, you go hit on Jane.


EXT. DEARBORN OUTREACH CENTER – DAY


SAM and a WOMAN are talking outside the building.


WOMAN
Matt was a nice guy. Kind of a tortured soul. Join the club. But he just seemed to have a lot going on.


SAM
Any idea what it was? Family, a girl?


WOMAN
He played it all pretty close to the vest. Something was eating at him, though, the last time I saw him. He almost slipped.


SAM
When?


WOMAN
Just before he died, I guess. Called me from Neal's Tavern. Said he was an inch away from drinking. So I ran over, talked him off the ledge.


SAM
Well, do you know what triggered it?


WOMAN
Like I said, he didn't share much.


INT. ‘JANE’S FLOWERS’ FLORIST SHOP – DAY


WOMAN
May I help you?


DEAN
Uh, yes. I, uh...


DEAN holds up his FBI badge.


DEAN
Just had a few questions about a customer of yours, name of Matthew Hammond.


WOMAN
Uh, sure. He's not in trouble, is he?


DEAN
Actually, Mr. Hammond is no longer with us.


WOMAN
Oh. Now it all makes sense.


DEAN
What does?


WOMAN
He came in, couple days ago, paid me three years in advance to keep his monthly delivery going.


DEAN
And where do the flowers go?


WOMAN
A Miss Elizabeth Duren.


DEAN
You mind, uh, writing Elizabeth's address down? I'd like to pay her a visit.


EXT. GRAVEYARD – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN are walking through the graveyard with flashlights.


DEAN
Here we go. Meet Elizabeth Duren.


SAM
Died at 10. Wow. So, who was she?


DEAN
I don't know. Why don't we chew on it back at the motel?


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


SAM is reading the Detroit Daily News archives online on his laptop.


SAM
Elizabeth Duren. Killed 10 years ago when a neighbor backed out of his driveway. Didn't see her bike. No one was ever charged. Police ruled it an accident.


DEAN
Let me guess. The neighbor's our tenth-floor pancake.


SAM nods.


SAM
At least we know he felt bad. I mean, the flowers...


DEAN
Kind of makes you wonder if the guy wasn't drunk when he ran her over.


DEAN looks at the beer bottle he’s drinking from. SAM watches him.


SAM
Yeah. All right. Well, regardless, now that we got a decent bead on ghost rider, let's go.


DEAN
What?


SAM
Burn her bones. Put her to rest.


DEAN
The fun never stops.


EXT. GRAVEYARD – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN dig, salt and burn.


EXT. CITY STREETS – NIGHT


A German Shepherd dog is chasing a MAN. He enters a diner, closes and locks the glass door behind him, and leans with his back against the door, breathing heavily. The dog leaps at the door, barking, and the MAN runs through the diner to the men’s room.


MAN
Keep that thing away from me!


The dog is no longer visible at the front door. The MAN locks the door of the men’s room behind him and leans with his back against it, breathing heavily.


MAN
All right.


The MAN takes out his cell phone and makes a call.


WOMAN (V-O)
911. What is your emergency?


MAN
I need help. There's a dog after me...


WOMAN (V-O)
What is your address?


MAN
I – I – I don't know! I'm – some restaurant somewhere. I'm –


The MAN sees the dog reflected in the mirror. It is sitting in the corner watching him.


WOMAN (V-O)
Sir? Sir?


The MAN lowers the phone and turns towards the dog.


WOMAN (V-O)
Hello? Hello sir, can you hear me?


The dog growls and leaps at the MAN, barking.


MAN
No. No!


Blood splatters the wall.


WOMAN (V-O)
Sir, you need to calm down. We'll send paramedics. Just tell me where you are. Sir? Sir?


The MAN lies dead on the ground.


ACT TWO
INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


DEAN and SAM enter the room. SAM is reading a newspaper.


DEAN
Oh, another night at the office. Why don't you take the first shower?


SAM
Listen to this. "A local man, Christopher Fisher, was ripped to shreds in a wild animal attack last night."


DEAN
It is a dangerous world out there.


DEAN sits on a bed, takes off his jacket and flops backwards onto the bed. SAM sits at the table.


SAM
He was in the restroom of a diner.


DEAN sits up again.


DEAN
Yeah, that doesn't sound right.


SAM
Apparently, uh, none of the patrons saw anything. Guy calls 911, screaming about a dog, but the operator didn't hear anything, either.


SAM is now using his laptop.


SAM
Wow. Looks like this guy had a history with dogs.


DEAN
Meaning?


SAM
Five years ago, he was arrested for running a dog-fighting operation.


DEAN gets up from the bed and joins Sam at the table.


DEAN
Classy. All right. So, what? He causes so much misery that some Rottweiler goes Cujo on him from beyond the grave? Wait a second. Do... do dogs even have ghosts?


SAM
First I've heard of it.


DEAN
That sounds weird. Ghost dog?


SAM
No weirder than ghost car, you know?


DEAN
You know what does make sense? Vengeance on the guy that Michael Vick'd you. I mean, I'm no one to judge, but it sounds to me like that guy had it coming.


SAM
Maybe... But maybe not. So, he got busted, got probation, started volunteering at an animal shelter.


DEAN
Yeah, 'cause he had to.


SAM
At first, yeah. But he kept going long after he served his time. Looks like he got really into it. Raised a lot of money for the cause.


SAM turns the laptop around to show DEAN an article titled “Dog shelter thanks volunteers for efforts.”


DEAN
Huh.


SAM
People change.


DEAN
Yeah, tell that to ghost dog.


DEAN gets up and walks away from the table, holding one hand to his back.


SAM
All right. Uh, get suited up. Let's go check out the body.


DEAN
What?


SAM
What?


DEAN
What?


DEAN turns back towards SAM.


DEAN
What?


SAM
Nothing. I... You okay?


DEAN
Peachy. Yeah, let's do this.


EXT. WAYNE COUNTY CORONER’S OFFICE – DAY


SAM
So, guess what I found. Red dirt. Under his nails. On his shoes, too.


DEAN
Just like the, uh, car-crash guy's floor?


SAM
Yeah. So, gotta be someplace around here they both walked.


INT. IMPALA, IN A RURAL AREA – DAY


DEAN
An apple farm?


SAM
Yeah. Apparently whatever's in red dirt makes great apples.


DEAN
Wow. I'd be so interested in that if I ate apples.


SAM
So this one's supposed to be pretty old, uh, mostly abandoned. Few hundred acres.


DEAN
A few hundred?! We're gonna be searching all year.


A graying MAN runs out into the road and holds out his arms to stop the car.


DEAN
Whoa!


DEAN brakes hard and stops just in front of the MAN. SAM and DEAN get out.


SAM
Hey. Uh... You okay?


DEAN
Guy just jumped in front of a car, Sam.


SAM
Uh, you want us to help you, sir?


The MAN is leaning over, breathing hard.


DEAN
Okay, well, why don't we get you out of here before you get roadkilled, huh?


MAN
Yeah.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – DAY


SAM hands the MAN a glass of water.


SAM
So, Warren. Just, uh, take a minute. Tell us what's going on.


WARREN
Look – you're good people, I can see that, but you can't do anything for me. No one can.


DEAN
Why not?


WARREN
Cause it's all impossible. You won't even believe me.


DEAN
Well, try us.


WARREN
I was just put on trial and sentenced to death.


DEAN
What'd you do?


WARREN
Held up a liquor store. I killed the owner and his wife. I wasn't thinking. I was young.


DEAN
Young? When was this?


WARREN
1981.


DEAN
And they just put you on trial?


WARREN
No, no, I just got out of prison.


DEAN
Okay, you're making less sense the more you talk.


DEAN gets up from his chair. SAM also gets up and holds out an arm to stop DEAN.


SAM
No, it's okay. Just... go on.


WARREN
Did 30 years. I just got paroled. Not that you're ever free of that. I think about it every day.


SAM
So, then, what were you running from?


WARREN
Well, I told you – the trial! All I know is, one minute I'm at the bar, and the next, I get jumped, wake up in a damn courtroom.


DEAN
Courtroom? Like a... courtroom?


WARREN
Well, no. There was a judge. Everything was crazy. It was in a barn.


SAM
At the apple farm?


WARREN
Yeah.


SAM
And this bar where you were grabbed?


WARREN
Neal's Tavern.


SAM [to DEAN]
Same place Matthew Hammond went before his... car accident. Think maybe dog guy went there, too?


SAM [to WARREN]
Is there anything else you can tell us?


WARREN
You believe me? Who the hell are you?


SAM
We kind of... specialize in crazy. So, uh, this judge – he got a name?


WARREN
No. But there was these weird symbols.


SAM
Symbols? Do you remember any of 'em? Can you draw them?


SAM gives WARREN some paper and a pencil.


DEAN
Excuse us a sec.


DEAN [to SAM]
Can I talk to you?


EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL – DAY


SAM
What is it?


DEAN
"What is it?" Sam, uh... How about a drunk driver, Michael Vick, a murderer?


SAM
And?


DEAN
And... when did our black-and-white case turn to mud? I'm just saying I'm having a hard time not rooting for the ghosts on this one.


SAM
No, you said it yourself – it's not on us to judge.


DEAN
Yeah, except that that's complete crap. Everybody judges all day long. Look, I'm just supposed to ignore what that guy did?


SAM
We've shot people, Dean – more than two.


DEAN
Yeah, you know what? When those ghosts come to kick my ass, they've got a compelling case.


SAM
So, what, you're saying – what? You don't want to work the job anymore?


DEAN
I'm just saying, you know, one simple friggin' day on the job – is that too much to ask?


SAM
Well, look. I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna go try and find that barn. You coming?


DEAN
I'm gonna check the bar.


SAM
To work or drink?


DEAN
I haven't decided.


DEAN walks away.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – DAY


WARREN
What's going on? Where'd he go?


SAM
He, uh... Everything's fine. Look, let's go back to that farm.


WARREN
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not going back.


SAM
Warren, I need your help finding that barn.


WARREN
It's red – it stands out. I'm not going back. They're out there.


SAM
Who?


WARREN
The people I killed. I just – no. No!


SAM
You're safer with me than not.


WARREN
No.


SAM
Okay.


SAM grabs the piece of paper WARREN is holding.


SAM
Fine.


SAM makes a salt circle around a chair in which WARREN is sitting.


SAM
I need you to stay inside this circle until I get back, okay? It'll protect you.


WARREN
How?


SAM
Just trust me, okay? I'm trying to help.


SAM turns on the television and tosses WARREN the remote.


SAM
Stay put.


SAM takes out his phone and makes a call.


SAM (on phone)
Bobby? Hey. Me. Listen – I'm sending you some symbols to look up.


SAM leaves the room. He mouths “Stay put” to WARREN.


INT. NEAL’S TAVERN – DAY


A man bumps into DEAN.


DEAN
No. Excuse me. Ah. Dive sweet dive.


DEAN sits at the bar.


BARTENDER
Hey.


DEAN
Well, now I know why everybody comes here.


BARTENDER
What can I get ya?


DEAN
Scotch and soda. You know, hold the soda. Make it a double. So, you, uh – you work the night shift?


BARTENDER
Why? You plan on making this a regular thing?


DEAN laughs.


DEAN
No, I just got a few questions. Believe it or not I'm a cop.


BARTENDER
I believe it. You look like you've seen some crap. I'm sorry, I was off all week, but Frank'll be back tomorrow.


DEAN
Right. Eh... I'll do another.


BARTENDER
Love life or job? Two quick doubles, it's something. I'm Mia, by the way.


DEAN
Well, Mia, that is a complex question. I'm Dean, by the way.


MIA
Well, Dean, luckily I'm like a captive shrink with unlimited alcohol. So, shoot.


DEAN laughs again.


DEAN
You like to hear people's problems, do ya?


MIA
I get curious. On occasion.


MIA pours another drink for DEAN and one for herself.


DEAN
Work thing. Since you asked. You ever, uh... You ever do something behind someone's back because you had to?


MIA
Now you feel bad? Well, Dean, if you had to, why feel guilty? That doesn't make any sense.


DEAN
Hmm.


They clink glasses.


DEAN
Well, you know, we don't have enough room for the worms if we pop that can, sister.


DEAN taps his glass to indicate he wants another drink.


MIA
You may want to slow your roll there.


DEAN
The more I drink, the better I tip.


MIA
Yeah, well, I'm off in an hour. So don't pass out on me.


DEAN
Well, then I think I'll switch to beer.


MIA
Good choice.


EXT. APPLE FARM – NIGHT


SAM drives up to the barn and gets out of the IMPALA. He enters the barn and looks around. The floor is red dirt. SAM’s phone rings.


SAM (on phone)
Hey, Bobby, what do ya got?


INT. STORAGE UNIT – NIGHT


BOBBY is sitting at a table surrounded by books.


BOBBY (on phone)
Those chicken scratches – definitely Egyptian. "Book of the Dead."


The scene alternates between SAM in the barn and BOBBY in the storage unit.


SAM (on phone)
So, good news, then.


BOBBY (on phone)
They identify the God Osiris. Real authoritarian type. He gets ahold of you, he's judge, jury, and executioner. Lore says that he can see directly into the human heart. He weighs the guilt. If he finds more than a feather's worth – boom, you're done.


SAM (on phone)
So what's he doing in Dearborn?


BOBBY (on phone)
Well, it seems like he just pops up and does his circuit-judge act and then disappears again. That's all I got so far.


BOBBY (on phone)
You know what this means.


SAM (on phone)
Yeah. We've got to find him before he goes underground again.


BOBBY (on phone)
No, you idjit. It means you two got to get the hell out of Dodge. This guy hones in on people who feel guilty. Who does that sound like to you?


EXT. OUTSIDE NEAL’S TAVERN – NIGHT


DEAN
It's been a while. But you owe yourself. It's nothing but a ground ball – you just got to put your mitt down. You are Dean Winchester. This is what you do.


DEAN’s phone rings. As he takes it out of his pocket, he walks offscreen, but his shadow is visible on the wall of the tavern. An arm grabs him from behind and his phone falls to the ground.


ACT THREE
INT. BARN AT APPLE FARM – NIGHT


SAM (on phone)
Dude, third message. You better not be loaded. Call me. This is important.


SAM hangs up. His phone rings and he answers it.


EXT. OUTSIDE NEAL’S TAVERN – NIGHT


SAM (on phone, V-O)
Dean. About time, man. I –


MIA (on phone)
Uh, hello?


The scene alternates between SAM in the barn and MIA outside the tavern.


SAM (on phone)
Who is this?


MIA (on phone)
Oh, well, I just – I picked this off the ground, where I've been standing for ten minutes listening to it ring. Is this Dean's phone?


SAM (on phone)
Yeah.


MIA (on phone)
Well... He was supposed to meet me here.


SAM (on phone)
Where are you? I can be right there.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


WARREN is still sitting in the chair surrounded by the salt circle. The television picture turns to static and the lights flicker.


WARREN
Sam?


WARREN hears glass shatter and gets up. He breaks the salt circle with his foot and runs out of the room, along the hallway and down some stairs. At the bottom of a stairwell he sees the ghosts of a man and a woman. He turns and runs back up the stairs, only to see the same ghosts in the hallway.


WARREN
No. Please. I'm sorry.


The ghosts approach him and the MALE GHOST raises a gun.


WARREN
Please.


MALE GHOST
You did it to us.


The MALE GHOST fires.


EXT. OUTSIDE NEAL’S TAVERN – NIGHT


MIA
Uh, here it is.


MIA hands SAM DEAN’s phone.


MIA
Uh, well, I hope he's okay.


SAM
Now, where exactly did you find this phone?


MIA
Uh... there.


SAM
Thanks.


SAM goes to the spot MIA indicated and finds red dirt.


INT. BARN AT APPLE FARM – NIGHT


SAM enters the barn holding a shotgun. In another part of the barn, DEAN is chained to a chair in a room that contains an ornate throne and Egyptian statues.


DEAN
Really, Warren? All you noticed were the symbols?


OSIRIS is now on the throne.


OSIRIS
Quit squirming, Mr. Winchester. They're Houdini-proof. Now, you want to talk charges, or...


DEAN
I'd rather talk about your Bukowski schtick at the bar. What, you can't jump a guy when he's sober?


OSIRIS
You and that waitress had quite a talk, huh? Get a couple drinks in you, and the guilt comes pouring out.


DEAN
Oh, eavesdropping – that's cute.


OSIRIS
Speaking of... You're gonna skulk all night, Sam?


The door to the room slides open by itself, revealing SAM.


DEAN
Sam?


OSIRIS
Nice job finding us. I assume you figured out who I am, too?


SAM
Yeah.


DEAN
You want to fill me in?


SAM
Osiris. He's an Egyptian God.


OSIRIS
Ta-da! Now, go about your business, Sammy.


SAM
Look, if anyone should be on trial, it's me.


OSIRIS
That's for me to decide. Now go away.


SAM
But he – he has the right to an attorney. Doesn't he?


OSIRIS
Huh.


SAM
Let me defend him.


OSIRIS
Well, that's unusual.


SAM
Are you gonna respect his rights or not?


OSIRIS
Why not?


DEAN
Uh, Sam? You're not a lawyer.


SAM takes a seat next to DEAN.


SAM
I was pre-law.


DEAN
Yeah, pre.


OSIRIS
All right, then. Let's get started. Now, the list of witnesses I can call – endless.


SAM
Objection!


OSIRIS
Are you gonna let me finish my sentence, Sam?


SAM
No. This isn't fair.


OSIRIS
Fair? I'm sorry. Moving on. I can make it very simple. Three witnesses.


SAM
Objection!


OSIRIS
Grounds?


SAM
Witness is being called without prior notice.


DEAN
Good one.


SAM
I saw that on "The Good Wife."


OSIRIS
Yes. Very fine objection. Denied!


SAM
What? Why?


OSIRIS
Because I'm the judge, son. Now stop objecting, or I'll find you in contempt – that is, kill you. So I advise you to let me move it along. The prosecution calls Joanna Beth Harvelle to the stand.


JO’s ghost appears.


DEAN
Jo?


JO
Dean. Sam. Long time.


OSIRIS beckons and JO takes a seat near his throne.


OSIRIS
State your name for the court.


JO
Jo Harvelle.


OSIRIS
And... what is your relationship to Dean Winchester?


JO
We worked together.


FLASHBACKS from Dean and Jo’s first meeting in 2.02 Everybody Loves a Clown and the two of them arguing in 2.06 No Exit.


OSIRIS
Isn't it true that you admired him?


JO
Well, as a hunter... yeah. As a guy, he was kind of a jerk.


DEAN looks somewhat hurt.


OSIRIS
So you saw him as a mentor of sorts?


JO
I wouldn't put it like that.


OSIRIS
How would you put it?


JO
I don't know. I trusted him. So if you're trying to say that he was a bad guy or something –


OSIRIS
Was it hard?


JO
What?


OSIRIS
Working with him... considering your feelings.


JO
No. What feelings?


OSIRIS
You would have done quite a bit for him – followed him into any battle.


JO
I know what you're getting at, and it's bull.


OSIRIS
So Dean had nothing to do with your first case, the one that started it all.


FLASHBACKS from 2.06 No Exit.


JO
It wasn't like that.


OSIRIS
No feelings. None at all. You would have chosen the same exact road. Ended up in that hardware store, holding the fuse.


DEAN
Oh, you're a piece of work. You know that? Putting words in her mouth –


OSIRIS gestures towards DEAN and DEAN gulps.


OSIRIS
Keep him under control, counsel... or I'll remove his tongue.


OSIRIS gestures again and DEAN draws a deep breath.


OSIRIS
Your witness.


SAM gets up and stands in front of JO.


SAM
Jo. So, um... your dad... was in the life?


JO
Yes, he was.


SAM
And your relationship with him?


JO
Good. I mean...


SAM
You idolized him.


JO
Basically.


SAM
So why'd you start? To impress some loudmouth ass you just met... Or 'cause you wanted to be like your dad?


JO
Daddy issues. Definitely. Listen, Dean, I don't –


OSIRIS flicks his hand and JO’s ghost disappears.


OSIRIS
All right. You two can have a moment to strategize. And then I'll call my next witness.


SAM sits down next to DEAN again.


SAM
All right. Who's the next witness? He looked at you like you'd know.


DEAN
I got no clue. This whole thing's like a friggin' episode of "Pee-Wee's Playhouse."


OSIRIS
Next witness! The prosecution calls... Sam Winchester to the stand.


OSIRIS gestures to the witness’s chair.


OSIRIS
Sam... Not exactly the life you expected, is it?


SAM
Details a little different.


OSIRIS
For a while there, you were gonna be a real lawyer. Marry Jess.


SAM
Yeah, that was a long time ago.


OSIRIS
But were you or were you not happily out of the family racket until Dean showed back up in that gas guzzler? Ah-ah. The truth, now.


FLASHBACKS to 1.01 Pilot: SAM and JESS kissing, SAM and DEAN fighting, DEAN slamming SAM against the bridge, JESS burning on the ceiling and SAM on the bed under the flames.


SAM
It's complicated.


OSIRIS
That one act had quite a domino effect. Come back, your girl's dead.


SAM
Well, that wasn't his fault.


OSIRIS
Sure, and neither is everything that came after – all the death and the blood and hanging on by a thread. None of that is on Dean, directly.


FLASHBACKS to DEAN punching SAM in 4.21 When the Levee Breaks and 2.03 Bloodlust, DEAN shoving BEN in 6.05 Live Free or Twihard, RONALD being shot in 2.12 Nightshifter, PAMELA bleeding to death in 4.15 Death Takes a Holiday, JO bleeding in 5.10 Abandon All Hope..., DEAN watching JOHN’s body burn in 2.02 Everybody Loves a Clown, DEAN standing at JOHN’s grave in 2.20 What Is and What Should Never Be, DEAN holding a dying SAM in 2.21 All Hell Breaks Loose: Part One, DEAN holding a bleeding LISA in 6.21 Let It Bleed, and DEAN crying as he tells SAM about torturing souls in Hell in 4.10 Heaven and Hell.


OSIRIS
But don't you think that your brother dragged you back into that catastrophic mess because he'd rather damn you with him than be alone?


There is a long pause.


SAM
No. One way or another, I'd have gotten pulled back in.


OSIRIS
You know that for certain?


SAM
Pretty sure.


OSIRIS
Pretty sure.


SAM
I'm positive.


OSIRIS
I believe you. Hey, if it was about convincing me, I would say...


SAM
What?


OSIRIS
I don't decide anything, Sam. I don't decide Dean's guilt. I just weigh the guilt that's already there. This is solely about how Dean feels, way down deep. Them's the breaks.


SAM
Wait. So, if Dean believes he's innocent, then he is?


OSIRIS
If. A big if. Why do I bring up the past? To see if he feels like dog food about it. People want to be judged. They really do. When your heart's heavy, let me tell you, real punishment's a mercy.


SAM
I want to call Dean to the stand.


OSIRIS
Oh, you do, now? There is an order to this stuff, you know. Okay. I'll allow it.


OSIRIS snaps his fingers and DEAN’s chains fall away.


SAM is standing in front of DEAN, who is in the witness chair.


SAM
So, Dean. When you came and got me, did you know Jess would die? Or any of it?


DEAN
'Course not.


SAM
Right. How could you? I mean, are you psychic? That's a question.


DEAN
No. Uh, definitely not psychic.


SAM
Great. So why would you feel guilty about not predicting the future?


DEAN
Yeah, I guess that doesn't make any sense. Actually, yeah, no, I don't.


SAM
What about Jo? Did you actually kill her?


DEAN
Uh, no.


SAM
Isn't it true that you don't feel guilty about her – that you're just... sad she's dead? That it just... blows?


DEAN
Actually... Maybe, yeah.


OSIRIS
Mm-mm-mm. I like your style, Sam. Very engaging.


SAM
Dean. Does any of this feel like it's really... on you?


DEAN
Not really.


SAM
Then is your heart heavy with guilt or just plain heavy and none of this guy's business?


DEAN
Uh, what you said – the second thing.


SAM
Then I rest my case.


OSIRIS
Very good... Both of you. All right. Because I really enjoyed that, I'm gonna be generous and ask – Dean, do you want me to call my last witness?


FLASHBACKS to DEAN stabbing AMY in 7.03 The Girl Next Door, and SAM saying “I know you didn't want to let her go, but it was the right thing to do” and DEAN replying “No problem” in ACT ONE of this episode.


OSIRIS
Or have we had enough?


DEAN sighs heavily.


SAM
What the hell's he talking about?


DEAN
Enough Ally McBealing. Just drop the hammer, will ya?


SAM
Wait, Dean, he's giving us more time!


DEAN
It's not gonna make a difference, Sam!


OSIRIS
You need another moment? You done?


OSIRIS bangs his staff three times on the ground.


OSIRIS
The court's reached a verdict. I find you, Dean Winchester, guilty in your heart... and sentence you to die. I'd suggest you get your affairs in order quickly.


ACT FOUR
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN arrive in the IMPALA. The area is a crime scene. Police officers wheel away a body on a stretcher.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN enter and see the empty chair and broken salt line.


SAM
Damn it, I told him.


DEAN
Osiris would have got to him one way or another. Guy's batting a thousand.


SAM
There's still time. We can figure something out.


Shots of SAM on the phone and DEAN researching on the laptop as SAM paces the room, then SAM still pacing as DEAN sits on the bed with his head bowed. SAM’s phone rings.


SAM (on phone)
Bobby. What do you got?


INT. BOBBY’S CAR – NIGHT


BOBBY (on phone)
A way to give Osiris a dirt nap.


The scene alternates between SAM in the hotel room and Bobby in his car.


SAM (on phone)
Good. We need it.


SAM nods to DEAN, who is drinking a glass of whiskey.


BOBBY (on phone)
Now, as near as I can figure, it ought to put him down for a couple of centuries, at least. It's worked a few times since the Pharaohs were big.


SAM (on phone)
So it's temporary?


BOBBY (on phone)
Long temporary. I say we slap that band-aid on and leave finding a cure to some hunter in a space suit. Now, you're gonna need to stab him with a ram's horn.


SAM (on phone)
A ram's horn? Where am I gonna find a ram's horn in Dearborn?


BOBBY (on phone)
No clue. But make sure it's a sharp piece. He ain't gonna let you stab him twice.


SAM (on phone)
Yeah. Thanks.


SAM hangs up and heads for the laptop.


SAM
Ram's horn. Ahh... okay.


His internet search returns 1,612 results.


SAM
Huh. Apparently, uh, Jewish people blow through them once a year.


DEAN
Where you gonna find one this time of night?


SAM
Uh... synagogue?


DEAN
You're gonna steal from a temple? Well, that's a new low.


DEAN drinks more whiskey.


SAM
You're on death row, Dean. Quit joking around. Here. Keys. I'll be back.


DEAN
The dick's gonna sic Jo after me, Sam.


SAM
You're a hunter, Dean. You know how to deal with ghosts.


DEAN gives SAM the keys to the IMPALA.


DEAN
So, you suggesting I kill her again?


SAM
You didn't kill her, Dean. I'll hurry.


SAM leaves. DEAN makes a salt circle around himself.


DEAN
You can come out now.


INT. SYNAGOGUE – NIGHT


SAM is looking around an office with a flashlight. He sees a ram’s horn and picks it up. A RABBI enters the room and turns on the light.


RABBI
I'm guessing you're not here for bar mitzvah lessons.


SAM
Uh...


INT. NEAL’S TAVERN – NIGHT


A WOMAN customer at the bar is talking to MIA. OSIRIS watches.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


JO
You know I'd never do this.


DEAN
I know.


JO
I guess it's his thing. Some kind of twisted eye for an eye.


DEAN
It's okay.


JO
No, it's not. You deserve better.


DEAN
No, you did. You deserved better, Jo.


IMPALA – NIGHT


SAM is driving with the ram’s horn on the seat beside him.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


JO
Dean, my life was good. Really.


DEAN
He was right, you know – that dick judge, about me.


JO
No, he wasn't.


DEAN
You were a kid.


JO
Not true.


DEAN
You and Sam. I just – you know, hunters are never kids. I never was. I didn't even stop to think about it.


JO
It's not your fault. It wasn't on you.


DEAN
No, but I didn't want to do it alone. Who does? No, the right thing would have been to send your ass back home to your mom.


JO
Like to have seen you try. He was right about one thing.


DEAN
What, your massive crush on me?


JO smiles.


JO
Shut up. You carry all kinds of crap you don't have to, Dean. It kinda gets clearer when you're dead.


DEAN
Well, in that case, you should be able to see that I am 90%... crap. I get rid of that, what then?


JO
You really want to die not knowing? Dean.


DEAN
Yeah.


JO
It's time.


JO’s ghost turns on the burners on the gas stove.


FLASHBACKS to 5.10 Abandon All Hope...: DEAN making explosives and placing the detonator in JO’s hand, DEAN kissing JO, the hardware store exploding.


EXT. NEAL’S TAVERN – NIGHT


The WOMAN leaves the bar and walks down the street. OSIRIS is waiting around a corner.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


JO’s ghost disappears from where it is standing at the stove and reappears almost instantly just outside DEAN’s salt circle.


JO
Come on, Dean. I used to hunt ghosts. I know the tricks.


The window glass shatters and wind breaks the salt circle.


JO
He's making me do this.


DEAN
It's okay.


EXT. STREET NEAR NEAL’S TAVERN – NIGHT


The WOMAN reaches her car, takes her keys out of her bag, drops them and picks them up. OSIRIS puts a hand on her shoulder, turns her around and covers her mouth with his hand as she tries to scream.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


JO’s ghost takes a lighter out of DEAN’s pocket.


FLASHBACKS to 5.10 Abandon All Hope...: DEAN placing the detonator in JO’s hand and her looking at him.


EXT. STREET NEAR NEAL’S TAVERN – NIGHT


The WOMAN and OSIRIS struggle. SAM comes up behind OSIRIS and stabs him with the ram’s horn. OSIRIS’s eyes change to blue light and his face cracks as he falls to the ground.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


JO’s ghost strokes DEAN’s cheek and drops the lighter, then vanishes. DEAN looks around.


DEAN
Jo?


ACT FIVE
EXT. NEXT TO A RIVER – DAY


SAM and DEAN are drinking beers next to the IMPALA.


SAM
So, uh, it seem like... you know, like... she was in pain?


DEAN
No. No, just kind of faded. Regular Jo. Actually, maybe a little happier.


DEAN takes a drink of his beer.


DEAN
I got a question. So where the hell did that come from, volunteering to defend me?


SAM
He was gonna kick me out.


DEAN
I don't know, man – in another life, you uh... you might have made a pretty decent scuzzbag.


SAM laughs.


SAM
I'm 0 for 1, Dean.


DEAN
Ah, it's not your fault. You were pretty convincing.


SAM
So, who was he talking about?


DEAN
Who?


SAM
That whole final witness thing.


DEAN
No idea. Honestly, that could be just about anybody dead we know. By the way... I mean, I get why Judge Judy put me on trial – I got guilt coming out of my pores. But... why'd he skip you?


SAM
I think I just don't... feel guilty anymore.


DEAN
Come on.


SAM
Look, I don't know what to tell you, Dean. I mean, I've spent a lot of time feeling pretty crappy – like, my whole life.


DEAN
What, you got a secret stash of happy pills?


SAM
Hell.


DEAN looks quizzical.


SAM
Look, I'm not saying it's logical. I just... you know, I feel like I did a lot of stuff I should have felt bad for, and then I paid a lot of dues and came out the other side, you know?


DEAN
And that worked? I mean, you really feel like your – your slate's wiped?


SAM
No. Nothing ever gets wiped.


SAM starts to walk around to the passenger side of the IMPALA.


SAM
You know? Sometimes I see Lucifer when I friggin' brush my teeth, but, I don't know, I guess I just finally feel like... my past is my past, and I can move on with my life. You know, hopefully.


DEAN
Easier said than done.


SAM
Not arguing that.


DEAN
Well, I don't know whether to be, uh, jealous or weirded out.


SAM
You'll get used to it. I mean, I don't want to sound lame, but... I kind of feel good, Dean.


DEAN
Well, you are going to be a pleasure to ride with.


They get into the IMPALA and drive away.
