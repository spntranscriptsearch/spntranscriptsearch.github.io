TEASER
INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH.

A nun is putting Bibles or hymnals in the pews. Candles flicker and there is a sound like wings fluttering. She gets nervous for a moment, then turns around and is startled to see someone appears behind her.

FATHER GIL (hands her another book)
One more.
That's all for tonight, sister. Come on. Let me walk you to your car.

ANDY (a voice from overhead)
Father?

FATHER GIL (looks up to where ANDY is standing on the balcony)
Andy?

ANDY
Father, God's not with us. (beat) Not anymore.

FATHER GIL
Andy, of course He is. Why would you say that? What's wrong?

ANDY (panting)
He can't help us. And if He can... He won't.

ANDY produces a gun, which he cocks and places under his chin.

FATHER GIL
Andy, wait!

ANDY shoots himself. The nun screams as ANDY's body slumps forward over the balcony wall. FATHER GIL looks sickened.

ACT ONE
INT. BOBBY’s place.

BOBBY is working on the Colt, while Dean melts metal into bullets. BOBBY looks at a magnifying glass at the Colt, and looks at a diagram of parts.

SAM (walking in)
Hey.

DEAN (looking up)
Hey, what's up?

SAM
Might've found some omens in Ohio. Dry lightning, barometric-pressure drop.

DEAN
Well, that's thrilling.

SAM
Plus, some guy blows his head off in a church and another goes postal in a hobby shop before the cops take him out.

Might be demonic omens.

DEAN
Or it could just be a suicide and a psycho scrapbooker.

SAM
Yeah, but it's our best lead since Lincoln.

DEAN
Where in Ohio?

SAM
Elizabethville. It's a half-dead factory town in the rust belt.

DEAN
There's got to be a demon or two in South Beach.

SAM (smiling)
Sorry, Hef. Maybe next time.
How's it going, Bobby?

BOBBY
Slow.

DEAN
Eh, I tell you, it's a little sad seeing the Colt like that.

BOBBY
Well, the only thing it's good for now is figuring out what makes it tick.

SAM
So what makes it tick?

BOBBY looks up – not amused.

SAM holds his hands up in amusement.

DEAN (rising)
So, if we want to go check out these omens in Ohio…
(teasingly, straight-faced)
... you think you can have that thing ready by this afternoon?

SAM chuckles. BOBBY stares at him incredulously.

BOBBY
Well, it won't kill demons by then, (beat) but I can promise you it'll kill you.

DEAN
(smiles) All right, come on, we're wasting the daylight.

SAM
See you, Bobby.

SAM and DEAN start to leave.

BOBBY
Hey! You boys run into anything — anything — you call me.

They nod and head out.


SCENE
Impala driving into a town.


SCENE
INT. CHURCH.

SAM and DEAN are in suits.

FATHER GIL
There's not much left for the insurance company. It was a suicide - I saw it myself.

DEAN
Well,this shouldn't take long, then.

FATHER GIL (sighs)
That's where Andy did it. It's the first time I'd seen him in weeks. He used to come every Sunday.

SAM
When did he stop?

FATHER GIL
Probably about ... two months ago? Right around the time everything else started to change.

SAM
Change how?

FATHER GIL
Oh, let's just say this used to be a town ... you could be proud of. People ... cared about each other. Andy sang in the choir, and then one day, he just ... wasn't Andy anymore. It was like he was ...

SAM
Possessed?

FATHER GIL
You could say that. Gambled away his money, cheated on his wife, destroyed his business. Yes, like a switch had flipped.

SAM
Father, did you know the man who killed those folks in the hobby shop?

FATHER GIL
Sure, Tony Perkins.

SAM
Tony Perkins.

FATHER GIL
Good man.

SAM
Would you say that his personality suddenly changed one day, too?

FATHER GIL
I never thought about it that way, but... yes. about the same time as Andy — about two months ago.

DEAN
Well, thank you, Father. Appreciate your time.

SAM and DEAN start to leave.

SAM (undertone to DEAN)
Two months ago, we open up the devil's gate, all of a sudden this town turns into Margaritaville? It's no coincidence.


SCENE
INT. HOTEL.

SAM and DEAN are entering their room, Dean chuckling at the mirrors on the ceiling, when the door across the hall opens.

DEAN
Richie. (The other guy looks up.) I don't believe it.

RICHIE
Hey, Dean... Winchester, right?

DEAN
Yeah.

A tall scantily dressed girl appears from Richie’s room.

RICHIE
This is my sister, uh, Cheryl.

CHERYL
Hey.

DEAN
Cheryl.

RICHIE
(hands CHERYL some money)
There.
(as CHERYL leaves, to DEAN and SAM)
Well, you know... stepsister.

DEAN
Come on in. This is my brother, Sam.

RICHIE
Hey. How you doing?

SAM
Not too bad. How do you two know each other?

DEAN
You were in school.

RICHIE
It was that succubus, in Canarsie right?

DEAN
Yeah, yeah.

RICHIE
Oh, man. You should have seen the rack on this broad. Freakin' tragedy when I had to gank her.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Who killed her? If I remember, your ass was toast until I showed up.

RICHIE
Oh, I forgot what a comedian this guy was.

DEAN
Richie, Richie, know what? I told you then and I'll tell you again — you're not cut out for this job. You're gonna get yourself killed.

(RICHIE’s phone rings)

RICHIE
(to caller)
Talk to me.
(to DEAN)
FYI, Winchester — words hurt.
(to caller)
Yeah? (pause) No, it's not a good time, babe. Later.

DEAN
So you find anything in this town, anyway?

RICHIE
Ah, no. I got nothing.
Oh, wait a minute. You mean as in demons and whatnot?

DEAN
Yeah.

RICHIE
No, I got nothing.

DEAN
Typical. What about your sister back there?

RICHIE
Oh, honestly? She definitely had the devil in her, but she wasn't no demon, you know what I'm saying?
(off DEAN’s reaction)
Right. Seriously.
Church guy, hobby-shop guy — they were lunch meat by the time I got there. Hey maybe they were possessed, but I can't prove it.

SAM
Yeah, that's where we are, too. You know, let's just say that demons are possessing people in this town. You know, raising hell—

DEAN
Yeah, but why would a demon blow his brains out?

RICHIE
Well, for fun? You know he wrecks one body, moves to another. You know, like taking a stolen car for a joyride.

DEAN
Anybody else left in the town that fits the profile — you know, nice guy turned douche, still breathing?

RICHIE
There's Trotter.

SAM
Who's that?

RICHIE
Well, he used to be head of the Rotary Club. And then people say he turned bastard all of a sudden? Brought in the gambling, the hookers. ... Ah, he practically owns this whole town.

SAM
Know where we could find him?

RICHIE
Oh, he'll be at his bar in a few hours.

MUSIC: Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Run Through the Jungle".

SCENE
EXT. DAY.

MUSIC: Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Run Through the Jungle" continues playing as SAM and DEAN pull up in the IMPALA. The town in buzzing, it looks like Mardi Gras — people wandering around with cocktails, sexy girls, lots of action.

DEAN (looking around at the action)
I thought you said this was some boarded-up factory town.

SAM
It is. At least, it's supposed to be.

DEAN
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's do some research. (DEAN looks excited to follow a bunch of attractive women. From a car, a woman in a miniskirt watches him, then gestures for him to come. DEAN approaches the car and looks at her, smiling; SAM comes back to fetch DEAN and smiles embarrassedly at the woman as he pulls DEAN away.



SCENE
INT. TROTTER’S BAR.

MUSIC: CCR continues to play as SAM and DEAN thread their way through a crowded bar. People are drinking and dancing and seem to be having a good time. DEAN is at ease, moving through the crowd like he's trying to pick out the best action. SAM is getting bumped into and seems to feel a little awkward and overstimulated.

RICHIE brushes past a woman and approaches SAM and DEAN. He's wearing a somewhat shiny orange short-sleeved shirt halfway unbuttoned to reveal a white t-shirt underneath.

DEAN
Oh, Richie. Look at you.

RICHIE
Hey.

DEAN and RICHIE shake hands.

DEAN
Bringing satin back.

RICHIE
Oh, you like this? Try Thai silk — Canal Street.
You'd have to pay $300 for threads like these, easy. Cost to me — fuggedaboutit.

SAM
How much is "forget about it"?

RICHIE
Ah, forget about it. That's Trotter over there. He sits there all night. Can't touch him.

SAM
So,what do we do now?

DEAN
I don't know about you guys, but I'm gonna do a little investigating with that bartender.

RICHIE
Easy. Me and her, we got a little ... somethin'-somethin' lined up for later.

DEAN
Yeah, right.

RICHIE
Stings, don't it? All right. I got to hit the head, release the hostages. Be back in a few.

SAM laughs at RICHIE's general cheesiness.

DEAN
No way he gets a girl like that. I mean, look at her. You could fit that ass on a nickel.

FATHER GIL
You think so?

DEAN
Oh. (laughs) Sorry, Padre.

FATHER GIL
Knew you boys would find your way here. They all do.

SAM
No offense, but what are you doing here, Father?

FATHER GIL
Like it or not, you go where your flock is.

The bartender - CASEY – pours him a drink.

CASEY
Plus, the clergy drinks for free.

FATHER GIL
True, and a certain bartender owes me a confession.

CASY
Not in this lifetime, Father.

FATHER GIL
I better see your butt on Sunday.
(looks at Dean as he leaves the seat)
Nickel or no nickel.

CASEY
What can I get you boys?

DEAN
What's your speciality?

CASEY
I make a mean hurricane.

DEAN
I guess we'll see about that.

SAM (to DEAN, laughing)
You drink hurricanes?

DEAN
I do now.



Over near the pool table, a man — REGGIE — enters.

REGGIE (tonelessly, emotionlessly)
Hi, John.

JOHN
Reggie. Everything okay with you?

REGGIE
I don't know. I'm just not feeling myself today.

(JOHN
Hey, what are you doing?!)

SAM (spots that REGGIE has a gun)
(to DEAN, hitting him and gesturing toward REGGIE)
Hey.

REGGIE raises his gun and shoots JOHN point-blank in the forehead. The crowd erupts in chaos. TROTTER and his henchguy stand up.

REGGIE aims the gun at his own head.

DEAN tackles him to the ground. SAM surreptitiously splashes holy water on him.

REGGIE seems really surprised and outraged by being splashed with water, but doesn't sizzle.
What are you doing?! (to himself) He slept with my wife. That bastard slept with my wife!

SAM
Somebody call 911!

SAM exchanges a look with TROTTER.


SCENE
LATER.

Police cuff REGGIE and lead him away.

SAM
Too many cops here. I say we roll.

DEAN
Just be cool. Poor jerk. Only thing possessing him was a sixer of Pabst.

SAM
So, what's the deal, then? People in this town getting possessed or not?

DEAN
I don't know. Maybe it is just what it is — town full of scumbags.

SAM
Yeah. Maybe.

POLICE OFFICER
You boys ready for your mug shots? (SAM and DEAN look nervous and the cop hastens to reassure them.) The photographer's gonna be here in a few, and ... take your picture for the local paper.

DEAN (relieved, faux enthusiastic):
Be an honor, Officer. What a thrill! (heh heh)

SAM
Yep, time to go. (rising)

DEAN
Wait a second. Wait a second.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Where's Richie?



SCENE
EXT. NIGHT.

CASEY and RICHIE arrive at a house.

RICHIE
So, how's a bartender afford a place like this?

CASEY
My parents left it to me. I don't come out here much — mostly when I want to be alone.


INT.

CASEY leads RICHIE into a rather gothic-looking basement.

RICHIE
Wow. This is, uh, ... charming? (pause) You sure you wouldn't be more comfortable in a bedroom or my motel room? I mean, not for nothing, but, you know, I got oils. (laughs)

CASEY
But I have toys.

RICHIE
Yeah, no. Toys trump oils.


CASEY lights candles.

RICHIE You don't get, uh, scared down here all by yourself?

CASEY
Of course not. Not when I've got a hunter to protect me.
She turns, and smiles briefly before closing her eyes, opening them to reveal fully black, demonic eyes. RICHIE's smile fades. CASEY blows out the candle she's holding and draws a blade as he pulls one from his boot. She stabs him and quickly twists his neck 180 degrees. His body drops to the ground.


END ACT ONE
ACT TWO
SCENE
INT. TROTTER’ BAR.

DEAN sits at a table, a large burger in front of him. He's hanging up a cell phone and looking at it speculatively as if he was just trying to reach someone.

SAM (to BARMAN)
Thanks.
(to DEAN, as he returns to table with beers)
You do realize there's red meat within striking distance, right?

DEAN
How many times i got to tell Richie, he's gonna get himself in trouble?

SAM
Dean, you're assuming he's missing. I mean, maybe he just bailed.

DEAN
He's a moron. I mean, he's a sweet moron, but he's not a coward. He wouldn't just bail. I got to go find him.

SAM
All right. Meanwhile I think I'm gonna trail this Trotter guy.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
Yeah. I don't know. Something about the way he looked at me last night.
Maybe there is something going on here.


SCENE
EXT. DAYTIME

BOBBY is shooting at a target with the restored COLT, making adjustments after he fires. Suddenly, RUBY appears in from of the target.

RUBY
Cute piece.

BOBBY
Who are you?

RUBY
It won't stop a demon, if that's what you think.

BOBBY
How the hell would you know?

RUBY
Oh, I don't know.
(She closes her eyes and when she opens them they are black, revealing she is a demon.)
Call it an educated guess?

BOBBY
Well, ain't I lucky, then? Found a subject for a test fire.

RUBY
Luck had nothing to do with it. But, hey, by all means. Take your best shot. (She poses in front of the target, arms outstretched.)

BOBBY hesitates.

RUBY
(sighs in exasperation) Are you gonna stand there like a pantywaist, or are you gonna shoot…

BOBBY shoots her in the chest.

RUBY looks down at the wound in the center of her chest.

RUBY
Ouch! That smarts a little.

BOBBY
What do you want?

RUBY
Peace on earth. A new shirt. Now ... do you want me to help you out with that gun or not? Hmm?



SCENE
INT.

SAM is in a corridor outside TROTTER’s office, where TROTTER is talking his henchdude. SAM's phone rings, startling him.

SAM
Dean. (in a hushed voice)

DEAN
Sammy.

SAM
Yeah. Hey. I can't talk right now.

DEAN
You okay?

SAM
Yeah, I'm fine. Just, uh ... meet me at the bar in 20 minutes, okay?

SAM hangs up.

DEAN
Sam!

The henchguy comes out of TROTTER's office and looks around for a moment, but SAM is nowhere to be seen.


SCENE
INT. TROTTER’s BAR.

A woman's shiny nails trail along the bar.

WOMAN (husky-voiced)
I got to tell you — every woman in this place? They want to eat you up.

DEAN
Well, hey. Anybody could have tackled that guy … and wrestled the gun away ... prevented mass murder.

WOMAN
Here's what I'm gonna do. (DEAN smiles in anticipation.)
Normally, I charge $400 a night.
(whispering in DEAN’s ear)

Why don't we call it an even deuce and get the hell out of here?

DEAN (incredulous)
What do I look like?

WOMAN
What do I look like? (as she walks away) Cheapskate.

CASEY
(laughs) Did I just see you strike out with a prostitute? How's that work?

DEAN
Well, I just told her I had a thing for the bartender. It was pretty easy.

CASEY
Who says the bartender's available?

DEAN
That's a good question. You got something going with some guy, you know, about yea tall, wears a sweatsuit ...?

CASEY
Who?

DEAN
Naw. My mistake. What do you say you and me grab a drink after your shift?

CASEY
I say why wait ... when we can go right now?

DEAN smiles.



DEAN and CASEY are leaving together.


SCENE
INT. HALL BY TROTTER’S OFFICE.

TROTTER and his HENCHDUDE walk out of TROTTER's office. SAM watches for a second from the hallway, then heads into the office. He starts rifling through the desk, looking at calendar, keys ... Suddenly the HENCHDUDE is there, taking a swing at SAM. SAM punches him hard, repeatedly, when he feels a gun to his neck.

TROTTER (holding the gun)
What are you doing here?

SAM
I think maybe you know.

TROTTER
Yeah? Well, I think I'm calling the cops!

SAM (seeming surprised)
Cops?

TROTTER
Breaking and entering, assault — you're in a peck of trouble, my friend.

SAM
Uh, wh-, uh ... I think I could probably explain it—

SAM suddenly twists around, grabs the gun from TROTTER, and points it at both men.
All right, back up! Get back.

TROTTER
Money's in the safe! Take it and go.

SAM
I don't want your money. I just got to be sure.

SAM splashes both men with holy water. They flinch and sputter from the sudden spritz of cold water, and look outraged, but nothing else happens.

TROTTER
What kind of psycho are you?

SAM (embarrassed)
Oh, god. Uh ... I'm sorry. (shrugs) Heh ... I ... think this was just a minor misunderstanding? (continuing to smile nervously) Yeah, okay, ummm .... How 'bout I just ... i just leave, 'cause ...
(removes bullets from gun)
I'll take these. (sheepishly shrugs)
(places gun down)
Okay, I'll, uh, I'll leave this for, uh ... you, uh ...
... Have a nice day?

SAM turns and walks rapidly out of the office, grimacing in embarrassment, and leaving TROTTER and his henchman staring in bewilderment.

SCENE - nighttime
The IMPALA is parked outside CASEY's house.


SCENE
INT. BASEMENT IN CASEY’S PARENT’S HOME.

DEAN
Looks like the maid's day off.

CASEY seems surprised at something.

DEAN (approaches, continuing) Everything okay?

CASEY (kisses DEAN)
Make yourself comfortable.

DEAN (strolling around casually)
Oh, I forgot to mention ... Richie was a friend of mine. When I realized I could track the GPS in his cellphone, I swung by earlier. Give him a proper burial. It's better than rotting in some skank's basement.

CASEY launches herself at DEAN but is stopped by an invisible barrier.

DEAN Oops.

DEAN kneels down, and peels back the corner of the rug, which is covering a devil’s trap he has drawn.

DEAN Tsk, tsk, tsk. Isn't that a buzz kill?

Sorry, sister, but you're going back to where you came from.

CASEY (laughs)
i don't think so.

DEAN takes out a book and begins to read in Latin.

DEAN
Spiritus immunde, undolara. Pasonitote ...

CASEY closes her eyes as if meditating, and suddenly a breeze is blowing into DEAN's face, and spinning the chandelier above CASEY. DEAN recollects himself, and begins reading again.

DEAN Spiritus immunde, undo—

The pages from DEAN’s book are pulled off by the mystical breeze. As he looks down at the book all the pages fly off and the book as well. CASEY opens her eyes and smiles. Underneath the book, now on the floor, a giant crack forms. Suddenly the bricks around the door cave in.

DEAN looks shocked and turns to look at CASEY, who looks pleased.

DEAN
What are you laughing at, bitch? You're still trapped.

CASEY
So are you... bitch.

ACT THREE
SCENE
INT. BASEMENT IN CASEY’S PARENT’S HOME.


LATER. DEAN lights candles and examines the rockfall.

CASEY
Lose something?

DEAN
(laughs) All you demons have such smart mouths.

CASEY
It's a gift.

DEAN
Yeah, well. Let's see if you're smiling when I send your ass back to Hell.

CASEY
Without your little exorcism book? Hey, go ahead.

DEAN (begin authoritatively)
Spiritus immunde ... un, guh ...

CASEY
Having a little trouble there, sport?

DEAN
(clears throat, begins again) Spiritus immunde, undolare, Pasonitote. (takes a breath, tries and fails to remember the next phrase)

CASEY
Nice try, but I think ... you just ordered a pizza. Guess you should have paid more attention in Latin class.

DEAN
Hey, I don't know what you're smiling about. You're not going anywhere.

CASEY
And, apparently, neither are you.

DEAN
Yeah, but I got somebody coming for me, and, uh... he did pay attention in class.

CASEY
Oh, right — Sam. Everyone says he's the brains of the outfit.

DEAN
Everyone?

CASEY
Sure. You Winchester boys are famous. Not Lohan famous, but, you know...

DEAN
Well, that's ... flattering. I'll be sure to let Sam know when he gets here.

CASEY
If he shows up first. (off DEAN's look) What, you thought I was flying solo?

You shouldn't underestimate, Dean, it might be the death of you.
You can give me hard eyes all you want, but the fact remains, we just have to wait and see who shows up first —
(waits)
The cavalry ... (smiles) or the Indians.



SCENE
INT. TROTTER’S bar. The sex worker who tried to pick up DEAN earlier sits at the bar, smiling at SAM.

PROSTITUTE
You look kind of tense. (SAM looks around to see if she's talking to him.) You know, I know a surefire way to relax.

SAM
Maybe later. (to the bartender:) Excuse me. Hi.

BARMAN
What can I get for you?

SAM
Um, you remember the guy I was with last night? We sat right here. Umm....

BARMAN
... The big hero who jumped on Reggie.

SAM
Yeah, yeah. The — the big hero. Right. Um, have you seen him around at all today?

BARMAN
Maybe. Depends.

SAM
D-depends on what?

BARMAN raises an eyebrow. SAM catches on.

SAM
Oh my — ! Does everyone around here have their hand out? (sighs, and pulls out some money and hands it to the BARMAN)

BARMAN
He left with Casey about an hour ago.

SAM
Any idea where they went?

BARMAN
Her place... for Bible study.

SAM
All right, you got an address?

BARMAN
What's wrong with you? You think I'm gonna give you a co-worker's address, just so you can go over there and get your freaky peeping-tom rocks off? (without pausing SAM hands more money over) (without pausing the BARMAN continues) Corner of Piermont and Clinton. Have fun.

SAM sighs. The prostitute licks a cherry lasciviously. SAM walks around her, avoiding her gaze.



SCENE
INT. BASEMENT IN CASEY’S PARENT’S HOME.

DEAN is moving a wine cask over to an opening (that daylight is apparently streaming in through). He holds out his cell phone to try to get a signal.

CASEY
Why don't you relax?

DEAN
Why don't you kiss my ass?

CASEY
Why, Dean, you're a poet. I had no idea. Look, we won't have any effect on the outcome of this. We might as well be civil.

DEAN
Civil, huh? Killing Richie — that was, that was civil? The guy was harmless.

CASEY
That knife he pulled on me? Didn't look so harmless.

DEAN
Ah, a knife wouldn't hurt you.

CASEY
No, but it would damage this body. And Casey has such a fine body, I wouldn't want to see it ripped.

DEAN
(laughs) A demon with a heart. Wow.

Well, you know, there's a bunch of dead people in town that might disagree with you.

CASEY
Hey, I didn't pull any triggers.

DEAN
Yeah? You did something.

CASEY
You want to know what I did — what I really did? I had lunch.

DEAN
Lunch?

CASEY
Me and Trotter. He had a cheeseburger, I had a salad, and I just pointed out the money that could be made with a few businesses that cater to harmless vice. So Trotter built it, and, man, did they come. Supposedly God-fearing folk, waist-deep in booze, sex, gambling. I barely lifted a finger.

DEAN
That's it?

CASEY
You don't get it. All you got to do is nudge humans in the right direction. Some whiskey here, a hooker there, and they'll walk right into hell with big, fat smiles on their faces. Your kind is corrupt, Dean. Weak.

Our will's stronger. That's why we'll win.

DEAN
And that's how it ends?

CASEY
No. That's how it begins.



LATER

INT. CASEY’s home.

Knocking on a door. The door swings open and SAM looks at it but decides to go through it anyway.

SAM
Dean?

SAM checks out the place. He steps on little pink piggy slippers that make a disturbing sound. Looking at a picture of CASEY with a guy, and a cross necklace hanging on top of it, he sees behind it a yellow powder. He sniffs it.

SAM
Sulfur.



INT. BASEMENT IN CASEY’S PARENT’S HOME.

DEAN
So, demons take over. I thought the meek shall inherit the earth.

CASEY
Oh, according to your Bible. (Off his look.) It's only a book, Dean.

DEAN
Not everyone would agree.

CASEY
Because it's God's book? (pause) Do you believe in God, Dean? I'd be surprised if you did.

DEAN
I don't know. I'd like to.

CASEY
Well, I don't see how you and your God, have done such a bang-up job. War, genocide — it's only getting worse. I mean, this past century, you people racked up a body count that amazed even us.

It's our turn now, and we're gonna do it right this time.

DEAN hears a noise. Looks up towards grate.

CASEY
Don't be hopeful, Dean. You're not delivered. It's only the wind.



INT. TROTTER’S BAR.

SAM
Bobby, It's Sam. We got a big problem. I found some sulfur, and now I can't find Dean. Call me as soon as you get this.
(to BARMAN)
Hey, excuse me. Um, they weren't there.

BARMAN
I guess you got to catch your jollies another night. Here. Why don't you have a drink ... and relax?

SAM
Yeah, I don't want to relax! What is it with the people in this town?

BARMAN
Suit yourself — princess. (The BARMAN takes the shot he had poured for SAM.)

SAM sees FATHER GIL sitting at a booth in the bar and approaches him.

SAM
Father.

FATHER GIL
Yes?

SAM
Um... can I, can I talk to you for a sec?



INT. THE BASEMENT.

DEAN
You know, you're piling it pretty high there, sweetheart. I'm not sure I'm buying.

CASEY
Why would I lie?

DEAN
Demons lie.

CASEY
Some do. Some are true believers.

DEAN
Believers in what?

CASEY
What, you think humans have an exclusive on a higher power?

DEAN (surprised)
You have a god?

CASEY
Sure. His name's Lucifer.

DEAN
You mean the Devil?

CASEY
Your word, not ours. Lucifer actually means "light bringer." Look it up.

Once he was the most beautiful of all God's angels, But God demanded that he bow down before Man, and when he refused, God banished him.

Tell me, Dean. How do you like bowing before lesser creatures?

DEAN
Lucifer's really real?

CASEY
Well, no one's actually seen him, but they say that he made us into what we are, and they say that he'll return.

DEAN
Oh, yeah? And, uh, you believe that?

CASEY
I've got faith.

DEAN
Mmm.

CASEY
So, you see? Is my kind really all that different than yours?

DEAN
Well, except that, uh, demons are evil.

CASEY
…and humans are such a lovable bunch. (beat) Dick Cheney.

DEAN
He one of yours?

CASEY
Not yet. Let's just say he's got a parking spot reserved for him downstairs.

DEAN
(laughs) Hey, speaking of downstairs ... what's it like down there?

CASEY
What, Hell?

DEAN
Yeah.

CASEY
That's right. You booked a one-way ticket with that deal. (DEAN laughs.)

You're not gonna like it, Dean. And, um, judging from the trouble you've caused, I don't think you'll be getting the presidential suite.

No, it's a pit of despair. Why do you think we want to come here?

DEAN looks somber.


INT. TROTTER’s bar.

SAM
So, the, the bartender the other night, Casey. You know her pretty well?

FATHER GIL (nodding)
Since she was in pigtails.

SAM
Well, um, she and my brother, they, uh... (pauses, thinking how to say this) they... left tonight. Together.

FATHER GIL
Ah. Well ... not that I approve, but they are consenting adults.

SAM
Right.

FATHER GIL
I, I'm sorry. You said "brother." I thought the two of you were insurance investigators?

SAM
Right, right. Well, well we are. Um, it's like, it's like a family business, you know?

FATHER GIL
Ah.

SAM
Anyways, um, so, so, I went to Casey's apartment, and they weren't there. I, I, I just have this feeling that they ... that they might be in trouble.

FATHER GIL
What kind of trouble?

SAM
Just ... trouble. Look, please, Father, I, I need your help. Is there anything you could tell me about Casey — anyplace she'd go, maybe ...?

FATHER GIL
Yes, there is a place. Let me get my jacket.

SAM
No, wait, wait, wait, Father. I can do this by myself.

FATHER GIL
Son, if Casey's really in trouble, then there's nothing to talk about.

He stands and puts on his coat. We see what SAM doesn’t — he has demon-black eyes.

FATHER GIL
Shall we go?

ACT FOUR
INT. BASEMENT.

CASEY
Kind of funny, don't you think? You and me sitting here like a couple of regular folk.

DEAN
Yeah, it's hilarious, you know, in that ... apocalyptic sort of way.

CASEY
You're all right, Dean. (DEAN scoffs.) The others don't describe you that way. But, you know, you're — you're likable.

DEAN
A demon likes me.
Sorry, I don't know how to respond to that.

CASEY
You could say thanks. (pause) That deal you made to save Sam — a lot of others would mock you for it, think it was weak or stupid. I don't.

DEAN
It's been kind of liberating, actually. Y’know, what's the point in worrying about a future, when you don't have one?

CASEY
Still, a year left. You're not scared?

DEAN
Nah.

CASEY
Not even a little?

DEAN (briefest of hesitations)
Of course not.


SCENE
INT. CAR.

FATHER GIL
So, insurance investigating. You enjoy the work?

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I ... like being able to help people.

FATHER GIL
Ever think about doing anything else?

SAM
Like what?

FATHER GIL
Mmm, anything. You seem like a pretty smart kid. Somehow I see you out in front of the pack. (pause) You could do some great things.

SAM
I don't know. I like doing what I'm doing, I guess.

FATHER GIL
Well, it's your life. Does, um ... Dean?

SAM
Yeah, Dean.

FATHER GIL
Does he find trouble often?

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, Dean finds his fair share.

FATHER GIL
Well, it's a good thing he has you — his brother's keeper.


INT. BASEMENT.

CASEY is stretching languorously on the floor.

CASEY
(sighs) Why, Dean, if I didn't know better, I'd say that was lust in your eyes.

Well, it would be one way to spend the time ... but I don't think you'd respect me in the morning.

DEAN
(quickly) That's okay.

I mean, hey, I barely respect you now.

Hey, can I ask you a question?

CASEY
I'm an open book.

DEAN
So, the gate opened. The demon army was let out. What now, huh? I'm not seeing a big, honking plan here.

CASEY
Honestly, there was a plan. Azazel was a tyrant, but ... he held us all together.

DEAN
Azazel?

CASEY
What, you think his friends just called him “yellow eyes”? He had a name. After you did him in, it all fell apart.

DEAN (smiling)
Sorry about that.

So, what? No chain of command?

CASEY
There was. It was Sam. Sam was supposed to be the grand pooh-bah and lead the big army, but ... he hasn't exactly stepped up to the plate, has he?

DEAN
Thank God for that.

CASEY
Again with God. You think this is a good thing? Now you've got chaos, a war without a front, hundreds of demons all jockeying for power, all fighting for the crown. Most of them gunning for your brother.

For the record, I was ready to follow Sam.



EXT. CASEY’S PARENT’S HOME.

FATHER GIL's station wagon pulls up in front of CASEY's home. FG and SAM get out of the car and start walking towards the home.

SAM
Dean?!


INT. BASEMENT.

DEAN hears his brother, looks up.

CASEY
Looks like you win.

Pounding on door is heard.



EXT. CASEY’S PARENT’S HOME.

SAM
Dean! (pounding door)

(to FATHER GIL) Check that way.

SAM walks off in the other direction around the house.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM
Dean?

DEAN
Sammy, down here! The basement caved in!

SAM (leaning over a grate)
Dean. Hey, hold on, okay? We're coming.

DEAN
Who's we?

SAM
I'm here with the Father.

DEAN glances back to CASEY, whose lips part — with excitement? It's hard to read her exactly. DEAN turns back to his brother.

DEAN
Sammy, be careful.

SAM turns to see FATHER GIL going black-eyed.

A shot is fired just past FATHER GIL's head, destroying a small statute. FATHER GIL whips around to see BOBBY, and then uses his powers to fling him aside. He then throws SAM into the windscreen of the Impala.

FATHER GIL leaves, and blows off the door of CASEY's home, entering it.

SAM, groaning, rolls off the hood of the car and rushes to where BOBBY lies on the ground.

SAM
Bobby, you all right?

BOBBY (nodding)
Yeah.

SAM
How did you know where we—

BOBBY (handing SAM the rebuilt Colt)
Go!

RUBY (suddenly appearing)
You heard the man. Go.



INT. BASEMENT.

Loud forceful bangs shove the stones aside. DEAN looks nervously towards CASEY who seems anticipatory.

FATHER GIL smashes in through the cave-in. DEAN rushes him. FATHER GIL points a finger and DEAN goes flying backwards.

CASEY looks at FATHER GIL, who approaches her.

CASEY
Stop!

She points to the devil’s trap. FATHER GIL kneels, and slams his fist down, cracking the floor and breaking the devil's trap. They steps out of the circle, and they embrace and kiss passionately.

DEAN struggles to his feet, and gestures to the two of them, looking revolted.
You two?

FATHER GIL
For centuries. We've been to hell and back, literally.

CASEY
Leave him be.

FATHER GIL grabs DEAN by the throat and lifts him up.

CASEY
Don't kill him. Let's just go.

Please.

SAM appears and shoots FATHER GIL with the Colt. Lightning emits from and circles FATHER GIL who twitches and dies. He points it at CASEY.

DEAN
Sam, wait!

But SAM shoots her, and the bodies of CASEY and FATHER GIL, no longer possessed, lie dead on the devil’s trap.

DEAN stares at his brother as he slowly lowers the Colt, and the bodies bleed out.

ACT FIVE
EXT. MAIN STREET ELIZABETHVILLE. DAYTIME.

Not much appears changed since the demons were killed.

BOBBY and DEAN are walking outside on a busy sidewalk.

DEAN
Well, what do you think, Bobby?

About what we did here, you think it made a difference?

BOBBY
Two less demons to worry about. That's not nothing.

DEAN
Yeah, but Trotter's still alive.

BOBBY
Humans ain't our job.

DEAN
Yeah, but you think anything's really gonna change? I mean maybe these people do just want to really destroy themselves. Maybe it is ... a losing battle.

BOBBY
Is that you or the demon girl talking?

DEAN
Ohhhh, it's me. Demon is dead, and so is that hot girl it was possessing.

BOBBY
(sighs) Well, had to be done. Sam was saving your life.

DEAN
Yeah, but you didn't see it, Bobby. It was cold.

(stops and turns for a face-to-face with Bobby) Bobby.

BOBBY
Yeah?

DEAN
Back in Wyoming, uh, there was this moment. Yellow Eyes said something to me.

BOBBY
What'd he say?

DEAN
That maybe when ... Sam came back from (shrugs) well wherever, ... that maybe he came back different.

BOBBY
Different how?

DEAN
I don't know. Whatever it was, it didn't sound good. You think ... think something's wrong with my brother?

BOBBY
(pauses briefly) No. Demons lie. I'm sure Sam's okay.

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, me too.


SCENE
INT. HOTEL ROOM.

SAM IS PACKING (as seen from the ceiling mirrors).

RUBY
Leaving so soon? We haven't even had a chance to celebrate.

SAM
Yeah, well you can celebrate without me.

RUBY
You're not gonna get all pouty on me now, are you? Come on! You killed two demons today.

SAM
Yeah, well, maybe you don't care, but I killed two humans, too.

RUBY
Sam, you know what happens when demons piggyback humans. They leave them rode hard and put up wet. Chances are those two would have died a slow, sticky death. You probably did them a favor.

SAM
Did them a favor? You're a cold bitch, you know that?

RUBY
Yeah, and this cold bitch has saved your ass a couple of times now. Some respect might be nice. Especially if you want me to help you out with Dean and his little problem.

SAM
You know what? You keep dangling that, but last I checked, Dean's still going to Hell.

RUBY
Everything in its own time, Sam. But there’s a quid pro quo here. We're in a war.

SAM
Right. But for some reason, you're fighting on our team. Now, tell me, why is that again?

RUBY
Go screw yourself, that's why.

SAM
Oh I see.

RUBY
I don't have to justify my actions to you, Sam. If you don't want my help, fine. Then give me the gun and I'll pass it on to someone who will use it.

SAM (points the COLT at RUBY)
Maybe I'll just use it on you.

RUBY
(shrugs) Go ahead, if that makes you happy. It's not gonna do much for Dean, though.

So, what's it gonna be, hmm?

(SAM lowers the Colt).
Ah hah. That's my boy.

This won't be easy, Sam. You're gonna have to do things that go against that gentle nature of yours. There'll be collateral damage... But, it has to be done.

SAM
Well, I don't have to like it.

RUBY
No. You wouldn't be Sam if you did. On the bright side, I'll be there with you. (SAM swallows nervously, looking unhappy.) That little fallen angel on your shoulder.
