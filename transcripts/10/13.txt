Teaser
Spencer, Iowa [We see a pickup truck with the license plate SEMPERFI driving on a road. A girl and boy are in the truck.]

JANET

You sure you’re okay to drive?

BILLY

Not really. But it’s nothing a little grease can’t fix. [He talks to his cell phone mounted in the truck.] Trini, find me the nearest Taco Town.

TRINI [voice of the phone navigation app]

Searching…

JANET

Ooh, I’m going to get a quesarito and a chi-chi melt.

TRINI

Turn right in 50 feet.

JANET

Um, Billy, I don’t think this is the way to Taco Town.

BILLY

What do you know? Your phone’s 3g. Trini doesn’t make mistakes.

TRINI

Continue for .3 miles, then turn left.

JANET

It’s freezing. Can you please turn off the air?

BILLY

It’s not on. [The truck reaches a road block and they stop.] What the hell?

JANET

Trini doesn’t make mistakes, huh?

BILLY

Trini, find a different route.

TRINI

Proceed ahead.

BILLY

Go screw yourself.

TRINI

You go screw yourself. Janet, get out of the truck.

JANET

Um, how does she know my name?

TRINI

[yelling] Janet, get out of the truck, now!

JANET

[Janet is frightened and opens the passenger door and gets out.] Oh my god.

BILLY

[Billy tries to open the driver’s door. It locked and he can’t unlock it. He tries to get out the passenger door, but it closes and locks. The truck begins to drive on its own.] No wait! Stop!

JANET [screams] Aah! Billy!

BILLY

[He is slamming on the brakes and trying to stop the truck as it crashes through the barricade.] No! No!

[The truck continues speeding ahead as he tries to steer and stop.] No! Help!

JANET

Billy!

BILLY

Stop!

TRINI

Destination dead ahead. [Janet screams as the truck crashes through another barricade and drives off the bridge.]

SUPERNATURAL TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
[Interior of the Men of Letters bunker warroom. Dean is heading upstairs eating as Sam is heading downstairs.]

SAM

Hey. [He notices what Dean is eating.] What in the world?

DEAN

A croissookie. [They continue walking toward the library.]

SAM

A croissookie?

DEAN

Mmhmm. Yeah, they’re the new cronuts.

SAM

Okay. So, what? Half cookie, half –

DEAN

Who gives a crap? They’re freakin’ awesome. [Dean puts the croissookie down on a table.] What did Cas say?

SAM

Uh, good news, bad news. [Sam takes his cellphone out of his backpack and puts the backpack on the table.] Bad news – he discovered riverboat gambling. Good news – he thinks he might be closing in on Cain.

DEAN

Oh wow. He thinks he might be.

SAM

Yeah. Just east of the Mississippi somewhere in Illinois.

DEAN

So maybe Cas finds Cain in the land of Lincoln. And then what? [Dean takes a sip of his coffee.]

SAM

And then we get him to tell us how to get rid of the mark.

DEAN

Don’t you think that if Cain knew how to remove the mark, he would have done it, like centuries ago?

SAM

We won’t know til we try.

DEAN

Sammy, I appreciate the effort, man. I do. But trying to find a cure for this thing, I-it’s like a dog chasing its tail. There’s no end in sight and you just end up dizzy.

SAM

Dean, where there is a will –

DEAN

There is a case. Hmm? Check this out. Iowa teen claims possessed pickup kills driver. [Dean holds up the tablet computer with the headline from The Iowa Weekly Review.] Let’s say we take our own trek to, uh, the Midwest.

[The Impala is driving down a road. They pull in and park in a parking lot by a Kasem College sign. They exit the Impala and head toward the college. Dean checks out two coeds walking by.]

Sorry I ever made you leave. [Another coed passes in front of him inside the college.] God, they’re everywhere. [Two girls are heading down the stairs.] Uh, which one of you is Janet Novoselic?

JANET

I am.

SAM

[Sam and Dean flash their FBI badges.] Agents Grohl and Cobain.

OTHER GIRL [to Janet] Bye.

JANET

I already talked to the police like nine times.

DEAN

Yeah, no, this is, uh – it’s uh, just a follow-up.

SAM

Yeah.

JANET

I have finals tomorrow.

SAM

Then we’ll make it fast. I promise.

[They are now in the college library. Dean keeps checking out the girls.]

JANET

It’s like I told the detective. I was drunk, but I wasn’t hallucinating. The truck had a mind of its own.

DEAN

How so?

JANET

Like, the air went full blast even though it wasn’t on and the radio went crazy and so did Trini.

DEAN

And Trini is?

SAM

Ah, you have to excuse my partner. When it comes to technology, he’s a little behind. Uh…he just learned how to poke on Facebook.

JANET

Uh, um, Trini is the nav app we were using. It – It’s like a talking map. You’re Gen X. Right.

DEAN

Okay, so Trini and everything else in the truck went all “Christine.”

JANET

Who’s Christine?

DEAN

It’s a Gen X thing.

JANET

Look, I don’t expect you to believe me. But, I swear that truck was hell-bent on killing Billy.

SAM

Did Billy have any enemies? Anybody who might have had a beef with him?

JANET

Maybe his brother Joey. They fought all the time. It’s so sad. They never got to set it right.

DEAN

Because Billy died.

JANET

No. Joey did. In Afghanistan.

SAM

Do you know where he’s buried?

JANET

He’s not. Poor guy never came home. I.E.D.

DEAN

Did Billy happen to have anything of his brother’s on him when he died? Uh, dog tags, a hat, something?

JANET

Just his pickup.

SAM

So the truck belonged to Joey?

JANET

Yeah. It was his pride and joy. Billy got it when he died, and, you know, it’s a thing.

DEAN

Yeah.

JANET

[Her phone rings.] Excuse me a sec. [She picks up her cell phone and walks away.]

SAM

So – so what’s a thing?

DEAN

You know, the truck thing. [Sam shakes his head – no.] You honor the deceased by driving their truck. Sam, they wrote a whole country song about it. Why don’t you Google it?

[Exterior Night at car impound lot. Dean cuts the chain lock and he and Sam enter.]

SAM

Alright, so we’re looking for something that used to resemble a pickup truck.

DEAN

Alright. Hey, here we go. [They approach the crashed truck and shine the flashlights on the SEMPERFI license plate.] Yeah, marine.

SAM

[Shining his flashlight on the drivers seat.] I’m guessing this ain’t oil.

DEAN

That is ectoplasm.

SAM

Huh. [Holds up his flashing EMF meter.] Look at this. Joey?

DEAN

Looks like it.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Alright, so big brother didn’t get along with little brother, was pissed that he was driving his baby. I get it.

SAM

What are you saying? If you died and I drove your car, you’d kill me?

DEAN

If you stunk her up with tacquitos, probably. Alright, let’s do this. [Sam and Dean pour salt and gasoline and burn the truck.]

ACT TWO
[Interior of a girl’s dorm room with the TV on.]

MAN ON TV

Makes it look like a – a pool in Reseda.

DELILAH

Ugh. I can’t believe our Art History final’s tomorrow.

JULIE

I know. This semester, like, totally flew by.

DELILAH

Yeah, time flies when you’re drunk. Want to come to the library with me? I still have so much to memorize. And I thought looking at pictures of naked guys was gonna be easy.

JULIE

Thanks, but I don’t really need to study for it. I have a photographic memory. #blessed

DELILAH

Um, you don’t need to study for it because you’re screwing the TA. #slut

JULIE

Hah. [Delilah leaves. Julie puts on a Kappa Delta Lamda baseball cap and takes selfies. She uploads the selfie using her cell phone and then gets a chat request on her laptop from PrincessElsa8.]

CHAT

Julie: who are you?

PrincessElsa8: a friend

Julie: #curious. what’s up friend?

PrincessElsa8: nm, liar

Julie: #confused! What did I lie about?

PrincessElsa8: 810

PrincessElsa8: I know.

PrincessElsa8: you’ll pay

[Julie gasps and deletes the chat conversation. The chat with PrincessElsa8: 810 comes back on her screen. She shuts off her computer but it turns back on with the chat. She unplugs her computer and the power cord. As she breathes we can see the steam of her breath. Her computer screen fills with 810. She closes the laptop and runs toward her door. The door slams shut as her laptop screen opens back up with 810. As she turns around and screams, the laptop cord is hissing like a snake and it circles her throat and strangles her.]

[Exterior of the college. Dean and Sam are walking as two coeds pass by, Dean turns to follow them.]

SAM

Hey. [Dean turns back around and walks with Sam.]

DEAN

I’m not gonna make it.

SAM

Focus.

[Interior of the dorm]

DETECTIVE

[She ducks under yellow crime scene tape walking into the dorm room. Sam follows ducking under the tape. Dean breaks the tape and walks in.] Delilah Marian, the roommate, found her this morning after an all-nighter at the library.

SAM

Strangulation?

DETECTIVE

Sicko used the power cord from the computer.

DEAN

Suspects?

DETECTIVE

None yet. The odd thing was the door was locked.

SAM

Hmm. Have you talked to any of the other girls who live here?

DETECTIVE

Well most of them have already left for spring break. But the roommate was really helpful. She gave us all of Julie’s passwords. And nowadays, the only way to find out anything about teenagers is through social media. Trust me, I got two of them. Excuse me, agents. [She heads out the door.]

SAM

Oh yeah, sure.

DEAN

Vengeful spirit, much? [He takes out his EMF meter.]

SAM

Yeah, but is it Joey’s or another ghost?

DEAN

I don’t know. [He holds the EMF meter by the laptop and it’s lit up.] So first it possesses a – a truck, and then it possesses a computer? Both machine-related kills.

SAM

So, what? You think we’re dealing with a “Ghost in the Machine”?

DEAN

Maybe. But if it is the same ghost, I mean, they usually anchor themselves to a place or a thing. How is this one jumping from one machine to the next? [Sam takes the laptop.]

[Exterior of Dorm building]

SAM

We really appreciate your help, Delilah. We know this can’t possibly be easy. Did Julie, by chance, know a student named Billy Bass?

DELILAH

Everyone knew Billy. He was the President of Sigma Theta Delta.

DEAN

STD?

DELILAH

Yeah. It’s the biggest frat on campus.

DEAN

Did, uh – did Julie know Billy’s brother Joey, the – the soldier?

DELILAH

I don’t think so. I didn’t even know Billy had a brother.

SAM

Did she have any enemies? Any reason why someone might want to hurt her?

DELILAH

No. Julie was really popular, super-sweet. I can’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt her.

DEAN

You know we’re federal agents, right? Lying to us is a big-time offense.

DELILAH

I’m not lying Agent. There’s just… nothing else to tell.

[INTERIOR of College Cafeteria. Dean is carrying a tray full of food toward Sam at a table, admiring the passing girls.]

DEAN

Alright. And a café au lait for the lady. [He hands Sam a coffee cup. Sam is searching through Julie’s pink laptop.] For me…

SAM

A heart attack?

DEAN

This is unreal. Look at this. I got Italian. I got Chinese. Serve yourself froyo. College is better than Vegas. What do you got?

SAM

Unfortunately, a lot of nada. I – I… [He looks at Dean with noodles hanging out of his mouth.] I hit up Julie’s Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Instachat, Snapchat, A.I.M., nothing but posts on Rush and “Fifty Shades of Grey”, the movie, not the book.

DEAN

Yeah. I didn’t get half of that.

SAM

It doesn’t matter. Now I’m going through her deleted files.

DEAN

You can do that?

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Hmm.

SAM

I mean, nothing ever really gets deleted from the Internet. You knew that, right?

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Alright. Here we go. This might be something. It’s a, uh – it’s a deleted Instachat from last night right around time of death.

DEAN

With who?

SAM

With PrincessElsa8. Look at this.

DEAN

[Reading chat messages.] Liar. I know. You’ll pay. Well, this Princess Elsa’s a bitch. What’s 810?

SAM

810?

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Uh, it’s a… I don’t know. Maybe it’s a date.

DEAN

Maybe it’s a time of day. Or an area code.

SAM

Uh, area code is for southeast Michigan. You know what? Here we go. There are three addresses in Spencer that have 810 in them.

DEAN

I’ll see if I can get this to go.

[The Impala pulls up across the street from a mailbox with 810 Downs Drive written on it. Inside the Impala, Sam is talking on his cellphone while Dean parks.]

SAM

[on phone] Yeah. You got it. Thank you Detective Petranzyk. We will keep in touch. [He hangs up.] So PrincessElsa8 is not some crazed cyber killer. She is a third-grader from Lake Nebagamon, Wisconsin, who is obsessed with “Frozen.” And she was fast asleep when the Instachat occurred.

DEAN

So, a hack job.

SAM

That’s what I’m thinking.

[They see a woman come out of the house at 810 Downs Drive carrying a plastic garbage bag. She walks down the block. They exit the Impala and follow her. She picks up bouquets of flowers by a utility pole and puts them in the garbage bag. Sam and Dean take out their badges.

SAM

Excuse me, ma’am. May we, uh, ask what you’re doing?

COREY

Um, throwing away dead flowers. Is that a crime?

DEAN

Well, it’s not a crime, just a little strange, uh, seeing as how they aren’t dead.

COREY

It’s not so strange when it feels like they’re taunting you. My husband was killed in a car accident here nine months ago.

SAM

I’m sorry to hear that.

DEAN

Our condolences.

COREY

Thank you. We were newlyweds. Never even made it to our first anniversary. And to have to be reminded of that every time I look out my window or leave the house…

DEAN

Understandable.

SAM

Forgive me, but did you notice anything… weird after your husband’s death. Any strange disturbances or…?

COREY

I’m not sure what you mean.

SAM

It’s nothing. Never mind.

DEAN

Any idea who’s leaving the flowers?

COREY

Some teenage girl. I think she goes to the college cause she’s always in Greek letters.

SAM

Do you know her name?

COREY

No. Uh, she has long red hair.

[EXTERIOR at outside café tables]

DEAN

[on his cell phone] This is Agent Grohl again. Listen, I know I told you to call at your earliest convenience, but scratch that. Call ASAP.

SAM

Look at this. [Sam is reading off his tablet while Dean is eating again.] Uh, Andrew Silver, 29-year old Spencer High School teacher killed in fatal accident. Uh, car burst into flames. Silver’s body was burned beyond recognition. And he is believed to have been killed upon impact.

DEAN

Okay. So Andy the angry ghost – he dies at 810 Downs Drive. And then he torments Julie with 810 on her computer. So, what’s his beef with her?

SAM

Yeah, and what’s his connection to Billy?

DEAN

Does it say where he’s buried?

SAM

He wasn’t. He was cremated.

DEAN

So no bones, and he’s not tethered to any object that we know of.

SAM

Yeah. How is Andrew haunting his victims? Are you gonna eat all that?

DEAN

Yeah. You want some?

[Interior of a frat room. Delilah is talking to a guy who is scrolling through Sext’r on his cell phone.]

DELILAH

The feds called… Like three times already. Kyle, are you listening to me?! I think they know. Maybe it’s time we should come clean.

KYLE

Uh, that’s not gonna happen.

DELILAH

Look where keeping our mouths shut got us. I think it’s karma. Maybe we’re being cursed or something. I don’t know. First Billy, now Julie?

KYLE

Look, it totally sucks that Billy and Julie died. But it’s just a crappy coincidence, not a curse.

DELILAH

If we don’t do something, I’m worried –

KYLE

Delilah, stop. I’m serious. You better keep your mouth shut or you’re gonna have a lot more than a curse to worry about.

[Delilah leaves his room. Kyle goes back to Sext’r and accepts a message from QTPie.]

QTPie Message: I’m bored. Wanna hook up?

KYLE

Hells yeah.

Kyle Message: Hells yeah! Come over STD.

QTPie Message: Guess we’re using condoms. LOL

KYLE

Where are you?

Kyle Message: Don’t worry. I’m clean. But hope we can get dirty. Where r u?

[Kyle hears a knock on his door. He gets up and opens it but no one is there. He sees another frat boy walking by in a towel.]

KYLE

Was that you?

FRAT BOY

No.

KYLE

[heads back in his room.] Tease. [His door slams shut. Kyle’s cell phone rings.] Hello.

VOICE ON CELL PHONE

[Yells] What time is it?

[Kyle looks at his clock and the time is 8:10. His stereo starts to get extremely loud. The speaker knobs begin turning the volume up on their own.

KYLE

Who the hell is this?!

[In the hallway, the frat boy in a towel knocks on Kyle’s door]

FRAT BOY

Lower the tunes, brah! Trying to study.

[Interior of Kyle’s room. The stereo is blasting. He’s screaming and his eyes, ears, and nose start to bleed. The windows break as glass flies everywhere and Kyle falls backwards, dead.]

ACT THREE
[Interior of Delilah’s dorm room. Sam is talking to Delilah.]

SAM

Are you okay?

DELILAH

Not really.

[Dean enters the room.]

SAM

Hey. What do you got?

DEAN

Death by decibel.

SAM

What?

DEAN

Kyle’s brains were jellied by his speakers. Oh, and get this. The, uh – the clock on his stereo stopped at 8:10.

SAM

8:10?

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Again?

DEAN

Mm-hmm. [To Delilah] Look we know you’re the one leaving the flowers. So, why don’t you just tell us what happened the night of Andrew Silver’s accident?

DELILAH

Uh…

SAM

Delilah, please. This is the third death in five days. Who knows who’s gonna be next.

DELILAH

I am. The car accident… wasn’t exactly an accident.

[Flashback to Billy’s truck with Billy driving and Kyle in the front. Delilah and Julie are in the back. They are using their cell phones.]

BILLY

Dude, I just retweeted your tweet.

KYLE

Dude, I just favorited yours.

JULIE

Okay, here. [She holds up her phone to take a selfie of her and Delilah.]

DELILAH

Oh, selfie. [Julie takes the picture.]

JULIE

OMG, I’m such a hag. I look like I’m 25.

DELILAH

Oh, that’s what filters are for.

JULIE

Ugh! Ew. Delete.

KYLE

Check this. Wait. I’m sending it to you, dude. Here.

[Billy almost hits another car head-on, hears the horn, and swerves out of the way. The other car hits the utility pole.]

DELILAH

Oh my God. Billy, call 911. [Andrew, the man in the other car is bloody and looks out his window at them in the truck.] Call 9—Call 911!

[A wire drops on Andrew’s car and sparks set the car on fire. He can’t get out of his car. The girls in the truck scream and Andrew screams in his car. Billy drives away fast.]

DELILAH

What the hell are you doing?

BILLY

I’m getting out of here before the cops come.

DELILAH

We – we just killed that guy. [She starts dialing her cell phone. Billy grabs at her phone.]

BILLY

No. Hey, you’re not calling the cops. 'Cause I already have a D.U.I., and if they find out I’m driving on a suspended license, I’m going to jail.

DELILAH

Come on Billy, this isn’t right. Help me out here, guys.

JULIE

It’s not our problem, Dee.

DELILAH

What?!

JULIE

Someone else will call the cops.

BILLY

Not a word. You hear me?

[Flashback ended. Back in Delilah’s dorm room.]

DELILAH

I shouldn’t have let them talk me out of it. It was wrong. And now we’re being punished. [Sam takes two containers of salt out of the duffel and hands one to Dean.] Seriously, what are the chances that three out of the four of us die in one week? It can’t be coincidence. [Dean is sprinkling a salt line by the door. Sam is sprinkling a circle of salt around a chair.]

SAM

It’s not a coincidence. It’s a ghost.

DEAN

It’s the vengeful spirit of Andrew Silver.

DELILAH

A ghost?

SAM

Yeah, they’re real.

DEAN

Yeah, it’s sort of what we do.

DELILAH

So, you’re like… Ghostbusters?

DEAN

Sure. First things first, though. You need to stay inside the salt circle while we take care of him, okay?

DELILAH

How do you take care of him? Please tell me you know how to take care of him.

SAM

Usually a ghost is tied to a place or an object. You get rid of the object, you get rid of the ghost. But with Andrew, it’s uh – it’s different.

DELILAH

What’s he tied to?

DEAN

We’re working on it.

SAM

But, if we can figure out how he’s traveling, we can figure out how to stop him.

DEAN

You know, this might be a Shocker situation. The paper said that he died from a collision, but Deliliah says that he died from electrocution. So maybe that’s how he’s surfing. He’s using the power lines as a conduit.

SAM

I mean, that would make sense with the computer and stereo kills but not the pickup. I mean, the truck runs on gas.

DEAN

Alright, it’s got to be something else then.

SAM

Alright, I’ll go back to the accident site, check it out. Stay here with her.

[Dean closes the door behind Sam. He takes out an iron crowbar from the duffel bag and hands Delilah a tissue box.]

DEAN

You getting tired?

DELILAH

No, I’m used to it. I stay up all night studying. Mostly to avoid the nightmares. My mom’s thrilled with my GPA, but I’m just… miserable. I think about Andrew all the time. And I’ve never even met the guy.

[Exterior by the accident scene. Sam walks up to the utility pole. He shines his flashlight up to the wires then across to a cell tower.]

[Interior of Delilah’s Dorm room]

DELILAH

It’s pretty crazy to obsess over someone you’ve never met.

DEAN

It’s not that crazy. The truth is, I can relate.

DELILAH

Really?

DEAN

I have made more mistakes than I can count. Ones that haunt me day and night.

DELILAH

So… how do you deal?

DEAN

Whiskey. Denial. I do my best to make things right, whatever that may be. For you, maybe it’s…maybe it’s coming clean. You know, finding a way to ask for forgiveness. But not breaking the bank at your local florist. I mean…real forgiveness. You can’t just bury stuff like this. You got to deal with it.

[Dean’s cell phone rings and he answers.] Hey what do you got?

SAM

[Exterior by the accident scene] Dean, Andrew’s not using power lines to move. He’s using Wi-Fi.

DEAN

Come again?

SAM

The – the wires that electrocuted Andrew, they – they feed directly into a Wi-Fi tower right across the street.

DEAN

[Interior of Delilah’s Dorm room] So even ghosts are online?

SAM

Apparently. [Exterior of accident scene] I mean, it would explain the truck kill. Billy’s cell must have been using the local Wi-Fi signal so, uh, Andrew’s ghost must have just hopped on to Trini, that – that nav app.

DEAN

And then Julie’s death by computer, [Interior of Delilah’s Dorm room] Kyle’s death by stereo with the wireless speakers.

SAM

I mean, it makes sense, Dean. We’re all just a bunch of electrical impulses, right? [Exterior of accident scene} So whenever Andrew died, his impulses just transferred to another current. You got to get Delilah somewhere safe. Turn off all the routers in that Sorority.

DEAN

[Interior of Deliliah’s Dorm room] Oh, yeah. Sure, Sammy. We’ll just kill the Internet. Wait, can we?

SAM

[Exterior at accident scene] Uh, no. No, not really.

DEAN

[Interior of Delilah’s Dorm room] Alright, so then how the hell are we gonna deal with the lawnmower man?

SAM

[Exterior at accident scene] You know what? I have an idea. Do what I said. Stay safe. I’ll call you back.

DEAN

[Interior of Delilah’s Dorm room] You know where the routers are?

DELILAH

I have no idea.

[The lights and computers start flashing on and off. You can see their breath. Andrew appears on all the devices and Delilah screams. Dean starts smashing all the screens with the crowbar.]

DELILAH

Is that gonna work?

DEAN

Worth a try. Need you to turn off everything that’s connected to Wi-Fi. [Andrew is on Delilah’s cell phone screen. Dean takes her phone and smashes it and then smashes his cell.]

[Exterior Sam is at the Door of Corey’s house. She opens the door.]

SAM

Hey.

COREY

Hey.

SAM

Uh, I’m so sorry to bother you Mrs. Silver, but I have an emergency and I really need your help. Now this is gonna sound strange…

COREY

It’s my husband, isn’t it? Come in.

[Interior of Delilah’s Dorm room. Dean grabs the duffel.]

DEAN

Come on. Let’s go.

DELILAH

Where are we going?

DEAN

[They exit her room into the hallway. Andrew is on computers in the rooms.] Someplace that doesn’t have a Wi-Fi signal.

DELILAH

The basement. The reception sucks down there. [They run down the hall as Andrew is on the computer screens in all the rooms they run past.]

DEAN

Alright, go, go, go.

[They run down the stairs.] Go, go go. Run, run. [They reach the basement. Dean shuts the door and starts salting the door.]

DELILAH

I thought the salt didn’t work.

DEAN

Because of the Wi-Fi. There’s no signal down here. There’s no computers. There’s no tablets. There’s no cellphones, so Andrew can’t bypass it. [Dean salts the basement window.] At least, I don’t think he can.

[Interior of Corey’s house.]

COREY

It wasn’t too long after the accident that Andrew started contacting me.

SAM

Contacting you how?

COREY

Online. At first I thought it was a joke, that someone was playing a cruel joke on a grieving widow. But Andrew knew things, things that only he and I would know – inside jokes, the code to our alarm, my obsession with Lifetime movies. It was then that I knew I had my husband back, even if it was just online.

SAM

Did you never think to ask him what he was?

COREY

Come on, Agent. I’ve read the books. I’ve seen the movies. I knew he was a ghost, or something, but… I didn’t care. He was my husband. And… it was great. Romantic, even. He’d send me love notes. We’d stay up all night reminiscing. But then, he started acting strange.

SAM

What do you mean, strange?

COREY

I don’t know. He’d just disappear, radio silence. And then, out of nowhere, he’d start emailing again. But he was different, focused.

SAM

He was focused on what?

COREY

Revenge. When the kids at the college started dying, I thought it might be Andrew. But what was I supposed to do? Call the cops and tell them the ghost of my dead husband was picking off co-eds? But mostly, I just didn’t want to face the truth. Because I knew it was revenge that brought him back, and if I tried to stop him, that he might go away. And I didn’t want to lose my husband again.

[Interior of the Dorm basement]

DEAN

Just try to stay calm, alright? [A vibrating noise starts.] What was that?

DELILAH

I don’t know.

[Dean begins looking under couch cushions and finds a cell phone ringing on silent. Andrew appears. Delilah screams. Dean approaches Andrew with the crowbar, but Andrew flings him across the basement.

DELILAH

Please don’t kill me. We didn’t mean to hurt you. It was an accident. I swear. If I could do it over again, I would have done the right thing. [Andrew begins to choke Delilah. Dean hits the ghost with the iron crowbar and he disappears.]

DEAN

Let’s go.

DELILAH

Where?

DEAN

The door.

DELILAH

It’s locked.

DEAN

Andrew, listen to me. You have every right to be pissed. [Dean picks of the cell phone and sends a 911 text. Sam receives a message and takes his phone from his pocket.] But take it from me…the more you kill, the crazier you’ll get. The blood fuels the rage. So it looks like to me you’ve got two choices. You can keep killing and become something that you won’t recognize or you can move on cause that is the only thing that is gonna give you peace. So it’s up to you, man. Pain or peace.

[Andrew appears behind Dean and pushes him through a door. Delilah screams. Dean gets up and Andrew appears and begins choking him. Delilah is holding up the cell phone as Corey is face messaging.]

COREY

Andrew? It’s Corey. Please listen to me. You have to stop this. Revenge – it’s hollow. And it’s pointless. It won’t bring you back.

[Interior of Corey’s house. Corey is holding up the phone.] I should have said this earlier. But, I couldn’t let go. But it’s time… for me to let go and for you to do the same.

[Interior of Dorm basement with Delilah holding up the phone.] Please. I’m begging you. [Andrew lets go of Dean.] Do this for me. Do it for us. Goodbye. [Andrew closes his eyes and disappears.]

ACT FOUR
[Dean and Sam pull up in the Impala to Corey’s house with Delilah in the back seat.]

DEAN

You sure you want to do this?

DELILAH

Yeah. I should have done this a long time ago.

[Delilah exits the Impala and walks up to Corey’s door and knocks. Corey opens the door, looks at Delilah and at Sam and Dean in the car.]

COREY

Come in. [Delilah enters the house and Corey closes the door.]

SAM

Looks like Andrew wasn’t the only one who chose peace.

DEAN

Yeah. Looks like. I think I’m gonna follow his lead, too.

SAM

What do you mean?

DEAN

My peace is helping people. Working cases. That’s all I want to do.

SAM

Is this about the Mark?

DEAN

I’m done trying to find a cure, Sammy.

SAM

Dean, Cas is so close.

DEAN

To what? We don’t even know if there is a cure. So far, we’ve got nothing. We have found nothing at the Men of Letters library. Metatron may or may not know something. And maybe Cas is on to something with Cain.

SAM

Maybe. Yeah, maybe. Nothing is guaranteed, Dean. So what? We can’t just stop fighting.

DEAN

Yes, we can.

SAM

So, this is it? Y-you’re just gonna – you’re just gonna give up.

DEAN

No. No, I’m not just gonna give up. I appreciate the effort, okay? I do. But the answer is not out there. It’s with me. I need to be the one calling the shots here, okay? I can’t keep waking up every morning with this false hope. I got to know where I stand. Otherwise, I’m gonna lose my freakin’ mind. So I’m gonna fight it til I can’t fight it anymore. And when all is said and done… I’ll go down swinging.
