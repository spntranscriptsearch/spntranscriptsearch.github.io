NOW
INT. GARTH'S BOAT - NIGHT
KEVIN TRAN is sleeping.
CROWLEY (V O)
Kevin. Kevin. I know what you're up to... [KEVIN's eyes snap open, he sits up.] Working with them, those Winchesters. Dead end, Kevin. [He is out of bed, looking around, trying to find CROWLEY.] Not here. Not here, either. Give up. [KEVIN looks under the bed.] I'm in your head, as well as everywhere else. Last time you irked me, you lost a finger. Imagine what will happen this time. [KEVIN holds up his arm, he has no hand, it's just a bloody stump, he screams, we hear a crack, he falls, his wrists, his legs are nothing but bloody stumps. He's surrounded in blood.]
SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)
ACT ONE
INT. GARTH'S BOAT - DAY
DEAN pounds on the metal door.
DEAN
Kevin, open up! Kevin! [KEVIN opens the door, huge cast iron skillet in hand, he looks haunted, tired, unkempt.] Whoa! Whoa. Geez. What's going on? What's with the S.O.S.? [SAM and DEAN enter.]
KEVIN
It's him.
SAM
It's who?
KEVIN
Crowley.
DEAN
What about him?
KEVIN
He's in my head.
SAM
He's... in your head.
KEVIN
Do you know what that means?
DEAN
Yeah, it means we need to up your anxiety meds. Kevin, you're dreaming. Look, if Crowley knew where you were, he'd do a hell of a lot more than mess with your head.
SAM
All right, where's Garth?
KEVIN
On a case or – or the dentist. I don't know. I haven't heard from him.
DEAN
Okay, well, what did you want to tell us that you couldn't say on the phone? Would you put the frying pan down, please? [KEVIN puts the pan on the stove.]
KEVIN
I translated the second trial from the tablet.
DEAN
You... crazy Prophet, you. Nice work!
KEVIN
And if Crowley's in my head, he knows.
SAM and DEAN
Okay, he's definitely not in your head.
SAM
He's not in your head, Kevin. It's okay. Just... We know you're distressed. Just stay with us, all right? What's the second trial?
KEVIN
An innocent soul has to be rescued from Hell and delivered unto Heaven.
DEAN
What?
KEVIN
"Unto." That's – that's how God talks.
SAM
Rescue a soul from Hell? Like actually... Go to Hell? How – how do you get a soul unto Heaven? I mean, how do you even get a soul out of Hell?
DEAN
We're gonna need an expert.
EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY
SAM puts a box in a hole in the ground, covers it with his foot.
CROSSROADS DEMON
Winchesters. [Demon is male, his eyes flash red.]
DEAN
What happened to the hot chicks?
CROSSROADS DEMON
I'm out of here.
SAM
Maybe not. [The crossroads demon looks down, he is standing in a huge devil's trap.]
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY
CROSSROADS DEMON
I ain't got nothing. [The crossroads demon is tied to a chair, seated under a devil's trap, DEAN dumps holy water on him, he sizzles.]
DEAN
Oh?
CROSSROADS DEMON
Bite me.
DEAN
Well, then how about another owie?
CROSSROADS DEMON
Ohh! [More holy water.]
SAM
You know, wouldn't it be a lot easier just to tell us how to enter Hell, uh, uninvited?
CROSSROADS DEMON
It's... a secret.
DEAN
We promise we won't tell anyone.
CROSSROADS DEMON
No! Wait. I can't. It's forbidden, man. They're gonna kill me. [SAM dumps holy water, it burns the demon.] Please... All right, look... For a price, y'all can be smuggled across Hell's border.
DEAN
By who?
CROSSROADS DEMON
Rogue reapers. They got secret ways, in and out. Not just Hell – the Veil, Heaven.
SAM
Rogue reapers smuggling people?
CROSSROADS DEMON
People, souls...
SAM
So, what? They're like hell coyotes?
CROSSROADS DEMON
Now kill me. Come on, man. Better death than Crowley.
DEAN
Hmm. Good point. But first you're gonna tell us... everything.
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
The IMPALA rolls into view; comes to a stop at the side of the street. It's raining. SAM and DEAN get out of the car, cross the street to where a yellow cab is parked, the taxi driver stands next to his cab, newspaper in hand.
DEAN
Ajay. Need to talk to you for a sec.
AJAY
You know my name. [The taxi driver removes his Bluetooth headset.]
SAM
And what you do. We want to do business.
AJAY
But you are mortal – flesh and blood.
SAM
But if we wanted to cross the border into Hell –
DEAN
visitor's pass.
AJAY
No one wants to get into Hell.
SAM
But could a coyote like you do it?
AJAY
It's possible. But I have special skills. I have overhead. It will be pricey.
DEAN
How pricey?
AJAY
You two are resourceful. One day, you will owe me a favor.
SAM
You say that like you know us.
AJAY
Of course. You're the Winchesters.
DEAN
Sorry. Have we met?
AJAY
I am the reaper who took Bobby Singer to Hell.
SAM
Bobby in Hell? We burned his bones. Once we did that, it was over. End of story.
AJAY
Hmm... Not necessarily.
DEAN
No, no, no, 'cause, see, Bobby was on the good side of things, and good guys go to the penthouse.
AJAY
Usually, mostly. Depends on who you know, what palms get greased. If you're on the King of Hell's no-fly list, no way you cruise the friendly skies.
DEAN
Crowley. Okay, let's do this. How much for two tickets down and three back?
SAM
Dean.
DEAN
What?
SAM
Come here. [They walk away from AJAY.] What the hell are you thinking?
DEAN
You heard the guy – Bobby's in Hell. We're gonna spring him.
SAM
We've gone over this, Dean. I have to do the trials solo.
DEAN
This is Bobby we're talking about, Sam. Now let's face it – you have not exactly been up to full speed lately, okay? We got one shot at this. We can't miss.
SAM
I'm not gonna miss. [SAM opens his jacket to show he's carrying Ruby's knife.] I'll bring him back. [SAM walks back to AJAY.] I'm in, just me.
AJAY
Follow me.
DEAN
[DEAN comes back.] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How does this... Work?
AJAY
Not to fret. He'll be back in exactly 24 hours time. Return for him then. [AJAY leads SAM away. DEAN looks at his watch. There's a guy standing to the side, he appears to be homeless, he's been watching and listening to the conversation. AJAY leads SAM into an alley that's totally covered in graffiti. There's a door painted on one of the walls, AJAY stops.]
AJAY
Take my hand.
SAM
And it gets creepier. [SAM takes AJAY's hand. AJAY stares straight ahead, the walls appear to shake, the paint appears to liquefy and stream towards the painted door. The door becomes encased in bright white light that spreads out to encompass AJAY and SAM, and they're sucked through. The light is gone, it's muted, there's a body, the head some feet away. The ground shakes, SAM and AJAY appear. SAM looks around, he's in a forest.]
EXT. FOREST - DAY
SAM
So, this is Hell?
AJAY
Not at all. This is Purgatory.
ACT TWO
EXT. PURGATORY - DAY
SAM
What do you mean this is Purgatory? This isn't what I paid for. I booked the Hell tour.
AJAY
Whoa, whoa, Winchester, detach. This is Hell-adjacent. Been down this highway many times before. Follow the stream to where three trees meet as one. Where they meet, there are rocks. Between the rocks is the portal.
SAM
A portal?
AJAY
A back door to Hell. Trust me – it'll work.
SAM
Wait. So you're not coming with me?
AJAY
Don't be ridiculous. Smuggling a mortal across the border is risky enough. But gate-crashing a Winchester into Hell seriously blows. No. I'll be back in 24 hours, precisely. Be here. [SAM raises the demon-killing knife, starts to turn away.] It's a good thing you brought that. It is not an easy place. [A flash of light and AJAY is gone.]
INT. GARTH'S BOAT - DAY
DEAN
Yo, Kev, it's me! [DEAN enters, he's carrying a tray of take-out food.] Kevin.
KEVIN
I believe the closet would be safest. [KEVIN opens the closet door, speaks from the doorway.]
DEAN
Safe from what?
KEVIN
Crowley. He's in my head, Dean. And if he's in my head, he knows where I am! You know, we – we should move out. We'll find another place.
DEAN
Geez, Kev, would you chill out, huh? Have a burger. Come on. Don't lose it on me now, dude. [KEVIN exits the closet.] There you go. That's it.
KEVIN
Just tell me when this all ends, 'cause that's the only thing I want to hear.
DEAN
No, like I told you before, this isn't going to end. Look, man, other guys, they got it easy, you know? It's all backyard barbecues and... bowling teams, but you and me? We got to carry a little extra weight.
KEVIN
I can't take it.
DEAN
Yes, you can. Hey, look at me. Now, this whole thing sucks. I know. But you suck it up and you push through because that's what we do. And when you get on board with that, the ride is a lot smoother. French fry?
KEVIN
I'm gonna – I'm gonna be in my room. Let me know when there's a good day. [KEVIN takes the tray of take-out, goes back into the closet and shuts the door.]
DEAN
That's my pie.
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
AJAY walks back to his yellow cab carrying pizza. He gets into the vehicle.
CROWLEY
Hello, Ajay. [CROWLEY is in the back seat.] It's been a while since we chatted – too long.
AJAY
Pizza? Extra anchovies. [He sees CROWLEY in the rearview mirror, holds up the plate of food.]
CROWLEY
Anything you want to get off your chest? An update?
AJAY
Um... No. No, not really.
CROWLEY
As you may recall, patience isn't one of my virtues. Well, I don't have any virtues, but if I did, I'm certain that patience wouldn't be one. So, sure there's nothing weighing on you? Nothing, say, about making a deal with the Winchesters?
AJAY
Sir, I know better than to attempt that.
CROWLEY
My operative saw you leaving with Sam Winchester.
AJAY
Oh! Oh, Sam Winchester. Oh, yes, that's, uh... A possibility.
CROWLEY
You're trying my non-patience.
AJAY
Sir, I was just doing what I do. As you are more than aware, I do occasionally – moonlight as a freelancer.
CROWLEY
You do not freelance with them. What did Sam want?
AJAY
Well, uh, actually, it's, uh, starting to come back. He may have wanted to get into Hell.
CROWLEY
My Hell? Why would he want to do that?
AJAY
I don't know. I swear. My job – I don't ask questions.
CROWLEY
And what time is Mr. Winchester due back from Hell?
AJAY
Uh, I'm picking him up in... Well, now 17 hours.
CROWLEY
I see. Anything else?
AJAY
No. I swear.
CROWLEY
Hmm. [CROWLEY stabs AJAY right through the seat the taxi driver is sitting on, the blade coming out through his chest. AJAY is dead.] That's one fare you won't be collecting.
EXT. PURGATORY - DAY
SAM is walking through the forest. He hears a branch snap. He's suddenly attacked. They wrestle, both are on the ground. SAM shoves his attacker away, grabs the monster's weapon and beheads it. He picks up the demon-killing knife and continues on still carrying the Purgatory weapon. He finds where the three trees meet as one and the rocks. He pulls a large rock away and there's blast of air coming through the opening showing a tunnel.
SAM
It's a rabbit hole. This is nuts. [SAM picks up the Purgatory weapon and is sucked into the tunnel.]
INT. HELL
SAM appears in a dark corridor, he grimaces as he pulls himself out of the opening. Sounds echo in the distance. He takes off his watch, places it on a high ledge. The Purgatory weapon at the ready, he heads down the corridor, everything is tinged in red. The corridor is arched, there are bodies chained to the walls. Souls cry, moan, scream.
WOMAN
I'm... innocent. Help me. [She's chained, all bloody and burned, appears to be standing right in a lit fireplace.]
MAN IN CELL
Eddy? Eddy? [He holds his hands out to SAM through the bars on the door to his cell, a huge hook covers his face.] Eddy? Eddy?
GIRL IN CELL
You came. I knew you would. I've been praying for it forever. [A young woman, pretty, pleads with SAM.] You came. I knew you would. I've been praying for it forever.
SAM
I'm not... him. I'm sorry.
GIRL IN CELL (V O)
You came. I knew you would. I've been praying for it. Forever. [SAM continues down the corridor. He stops at another door, it opens easily but with a rusty squeak. He slowly enters the cell. There's a figure against the far wall wearing a leather jacket and ball cap. There are scratches on the wall, someone has been counting.]
SAM
Bobby? [The figure turns around. It's BOBBY, looking very haggard. He decks SAM.]
ACT THREE
INT. HELL
BOBBY
Get the hell out of here, you black-eyed son of a bitch.
SAM
What? Bobby, it's Sam.
BOBBY
Yeah, and I'm Elvis. Move your ass!
SAM
Bobby –
BOBBY
get!
SAM
It's me! Okay, damn it. If it's not Sam... Then how do I know all about you and Tori Spelling?
BOBBY
What?
SAM
You're a fan. Yeah. Or – or, uh... Okay. What about your free pedicure at the Mall of America? You made Dean swear to never tell another living soul how it changed your life.
BOBBY
Sam? [BOBBY grabs SAM, they hug.] I'm sorry, Sam, but you're the 200th Sam I've seen today. That's how they screw with me. Just endless Sams and Deans all wearing the same black eyes. Wait a minute. What the hell are you doing here? Please don't tell me it's what I think it is.
SAM
No, no, no, Bobby, I'm good. I... I'm here to get you. You don't belong here, Bobby. [He hands over the demon-killing knife to BOBBY.] And we're getting you out.
INT. MANSION - DAY
CROWLEY
Am I the only one who sees the urgency of this situation?
FEMALE DEMON
Sir –
CROWLEY
Something is going on. My Hellhound has been killed. Winchester jumbo size is trying to break into the mother ship. And that Prophet of theirs is madly translating away. Add it up!
FEMALE DEMON
I will, sir.
CROWLEY
Where did we get you, huh? Temp agency? I need Kevin Tran, and I need his half of the tablet. Apparently, his half has the good stuff, where mine has the acknowledgements and "about the author."
FEMALE DEMON
It will be done.
CROWLEY
It had better be. Find that kid.
INT. GARTH'S BOAT - DAY
DEAN
[DEAN is at the stove, frying eggs and bacon.] Hey, Kevin! Come in here and grab some of these eggs. Kev! Come on, man. You can't hide in there forever. [KEVIN enters through the main door.] Where the hell you been? What happened to being scared?
KEVIN
I am scared. So I made a preemptive move.
DEAN
So... Made a what now?
KEVIN
I can't sit here with the tablet like a... sitting duck and Crowley breathing down my ass. Getting rid of the tablet just takes off some of the pressure.
DEAN
Wait. Getting rid of it?
KEVIN
Temporarily. I hid it.
DEAN
What? Where?
KEVIN
If I tell you where, it's not hidden, is it?
DEAN
Kevin, tell me where the damn tablet is, or I swear to you –
KEVIN
You'll what, Dean? [He goes back into the closet and shuts the door.]
DEAN
Kevin!
NAOMI
Kids. So cute when they're little. Then they turn into teenagers, and the party's over. We haven't been formally introduced, Dean. My name is Naomi. [She sticks her hand out to shake DEAN's hand, but he backs away from her.]
DEAN
Oh, I know who you are. And I know what you did to Cas after he got out of Purgatory.
NAOMI
After I rescued him from Purgatory, you mean, at the cost of many angels' lives.
DEAN
You screwed with his head and had him spy on us.
NAOMI
Well, it is true that I have spoken with Castiel many times, trying to reach out to him, trying to help him. Dean, you must have noticed how Purgatory changed him. I mean, he's been unstable in the past, but I was shocked at how damaged he is now.
DEAN
Stop, okay? Don't – don't try to spin this. You think I don't know that you told him to try and kill me?
NAOMI
Hmm. Yeah, I suppose that is how he would hear it. When I learned of the Angel tablet, I did tell Castiel to get it at any cost. That's my job – to protect heaven. I'm a warrior, just as you are. What would you expect? And now Castiel is in the wind with a hydrogen bomb in his pocket, and I – I'm scared, for all of us.
DEAN
Save it. See, I don't trust Angels, which means I don't trust you.
NAOMI
And yet you haven't warded this place against us. I know. You're hoping Castiel will return to you. I admire your loyalty. I only wish he felt the same way. I know you don't want to believe it, Dean, but we're on the same side – shutting the Gates of Hell, bringing Castiel in from the cold. Take a moment. Think about what I've said. Oh. I know you've been doing business with Ajay. He did mention, didn't he, that his way into Hell is through Purgatory? I knew you'd want to know. You see, we can be of help to each other. [She leaves, we hear wings flapping away.]
INT. HELL
BOBBY
You know where the hell you're going? [BOBBY and SAM are making their way through Hell's corridors.]
SAM
Yeah, we're almost there. Get back. Get back, get back. [There's a demon walking towards them. SAM attacks first, then BOBBY stabs the demon with the demon-killing knife. Another demon attacks BOBBY, but again he uses the knife.]
SAM
Let's go! We got to get out of here! [There are two SAMs, one on BOBBY's right, one on his left.]
SAM (Right side)
Bobby, they're messing with you.
SAM (Left side)
Don't listen to him. He's not real. [BOBBY looks between the two SAMs.]
SAM (Right side)
Bobby, get away from him!
SAM (Left side)
We got to go now – aah! [BOBBY stabs left-side SAM, he lights up from the demon-killing knife, falls down, dead.]
SAM
You knew somehow, right?
BOBBY
Took a chance. 50/50. [They're running down the corridor.] What do we do now?
SAM
Look, look. [SAM grabs his watch from the ledge, they keep running.]
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
We see AJAY seated in his cab, DEAN comes around the corner, stops by the car door, pounds on the window.]
DEAN
Ajay? Hey. [He opens the door, but AJAY is dead.]
EXT. PURGATORY - DAY
SAM and BOBBY are spewed out of Hell into Purgatory. SAM puts on his watch.
BOBBY
What the hell is this?
SAM
All right, don't get all pissed off. Purgatory.
BOBBY
Balls!
SAM
Let's go. [They leave, the doorway still open.]
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
DEAN
Yeah. Hey, it's me. [DEAN is talking on his cellphone.] I know. I know, man. It's been a long time. I mean, I wanted to call. I did. I just, uh... I thought it might be better if I didn't.
EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
BENNY
So good to hear your voice, Dean. I mean that. [BENNY is sitting in his truck, talking on his cellphone with DEAN. Scene shifts between the alley with the graffiti and BENNY in his truck.]
DEAN
How you been?
BENNY
Oh, you know... I get by.
DEAN
I guess I let you down, huh?
BENNY
Look, I'm, uh... I'm just happy as hell to hear from you. [He's sipping from a container that looks almost empty.]
DEAN
You might change your mind about that.
BENNY
Why? What you mean?
DEAN
Benny, I got to ask you a favor. It's a big one.
EXT. PURGATORY - DAY
BOBBY
So, how many more of these trials after this? [SAM and BOBBY are walking through the Purgatory forest.]
SAM
Just one. Don't know what it is, though – not yet. Kevin's still translating.
BOBBY
Well, you saw back there in Hell, I ain't got a lot of rust. Just feels so good to be back in action again. Might be handy if you had me around to help.
SAM
Bobby, I'd – I'd love that, believe me. The thing is, for this trial to be completed, your soul has to enter Heaven. And besides, if that weren't the case, we burned your bones, Bobby. There's nothing to tie your spirit to earth.
BOBBY
Yeah. Yeah, well... You know, I always figured that'd be the end of it... You know, just a Hunter's funeral. Zip. Nothing. And I was okay with that. Imagine my surprise.
SAM
Well, I guess if there has to be an eternity, I'd pick Heaven over Hell.
BOBBY
Yeah. 'Cause there's nothing screwy going on up there.
SAM
I wish I made the rules.
BOBBY
Well... I'll, uh, do my part, get to the end of this, but... I ain't exactly the retiring type, so, you idjits figure out a way to spring me...
SAM
Yeah. No, of course. [They've stopped walking, SAM is looking around.] That's, uh – yeah.
BOBBY
Oh, well, let's get topside. What's going on, Sam?
SAM
This is it. This is the place. I'm sure of it. [We see the head and the body that marked the entry spot into Purgatory.]
BOBBY
Where your cabbie's supposed to meet you?
SAM
Yeah. At exactly... now. [SAM looks at his watch.]
BOBBY
So, he's running a little late.
SAM
No, see, that's the thing. He was very specific, Bobby, like, to the minute.
BOBBY
And if he doesn't show...?
SAM
We got no way out.
ACT FOUR
EXT. ALLEY - DAY
DEAN
If you want nothing to do with this, I completely understand. [DEAN stands by the IMPALA, they're in the graffiti'd alley.]
BENNY
Wow. When Dean Winchester asks for a favor, he's not screwing around.
DEAN
Benny, sending you back there is the last thing I ever wanted to do.
BENNY
I know. I know.
DEAN
But my little brother is stuck down there.
BENNY
This would be the little brother who wants to kill me, right?
DEAN
You got access to the place.
BENNY
By "access," you mean "getting beheaded"?
DEAN
Yeah, you're right – it's too much. It's not like I've exactly been there for you lately. [DEAN's voice shakes.]
BENNY
What? Oh, come on, Dean. You know I love a challenge.
DEAN
You're serious?
BENNY
Hey, he's your brother. I say let's do this.
DEAN
I owe you.
BENNY
Oh, you don't owe me nothing. Truth is, uh... I could use a break from all this.
DEAN
It really been that tough?
BENNY
I'm not a good fit, Dean. Not with vampires and, for sure, not with the humans. I don't belong. And after a while... that starts to wear on you. Right? Cry me a river. Like you need to listen to this.
DEAN
Well, when you get back up here, we're gonna fix all that, okay?
BENNY
When I get back?
DEAN
Yeah, you find the portal, and your ride out of Purgatory with Sam just like you did with me, okay? As soon as I send you back, I'm gonna haul my ass up to Maine, and I'm gonna be waiting there for you when you get topside.
BENNY
Yeah. That sounds like a plan, chief. Let's get on with it.
DEAN
You sure about this?
BENNY
Not my first rodeo, man.
DEAN reaches into the IMPALA, pulls a machete out of its case. He extends his right hand to BENNY to shake, they clasp hands and pull each other into a hug.
DEAN
Thank you. [They pull apart.]
BENNY
Well, come on. You a wimp? [DEAN beheads BENNY.]
BOBBY (V O)
Dean spent a year in this place?
EXT. PURGATORY - DAY
SAM
Running and fighting, all day, every day.
BOBBY
Must have been hell on you not being able to get him out all that time. You did try?
SAM
Look, Bobby, Dean and I had an agreement, okay?
BOBBY
I know that agreement. I taught you that agreement. That's a non-agreement. I get the feeling a lot must have happened while I was gone. Sam! [Three vampires are ready to attack. SAM decapitates the first one, the second one attacks BOBBY but SAM beheads it. The third one is pulled back by BENNY who then rips out its throat. BOBBY is ready to stab BENNY when SAM grabs him.]
SAM
Bobby, no, no, wait! Wait! Wait! Why are you here? [BENNY, his vampire teeth exposed, stands.]
BENNY
Dean sent me.
BOBBY
Dean? Not my Dean.
SAM
He's a buddy of Dean's, Bobby.
BOBBY
A buddy?
BENNY
A good buddy.
BOBBY
A frigging vampire? Well, you two really went off the rails while I was gone, didn't you?
EXT. ALLEY - DAY
Shot pulls back from a small pool of blood to DEAN tossing the bloody machete into the trunk of the IMPALA. He slams the trunk shut and gets into the car. As he drives out of the alley, the homeless man steps away from the building. His eyes flash demon black.
EXT. PURGATORY - DAY
SAM
Hey, Benny, listen – I know you saved my brother's ass a few times down here, and I respect that. [BOBBY, SAM, and BENNY are walking through the Purgatory forest.]
BENNY
Yeah, and now I'm trying to save yours. You know, I'm a disgrace to my own people. Yeah, this is the spot.
BOBBY
The seam that gets us back up top?
BENNY
Mm-hmm.
BOBBY
Is that it? [We see the blue flickering portal.]
BENNY
Yeah, that's it. You boys remember what I told you?
SAM
Yeah. All right, Bobby, here it goes. When we get to earth and I release you, it's an express straight to heaven. No time for goodbyes.
BOBBY
Already said goodbye to you once, Sam. Didn't seem to take. No reason to think I won't see you again somewhere down the road.
SAM
Yeah.
BOBBY
But if they give me a rocking chair up there, I'm raising hell. [BOBBY uses the demon knife to slice his forearm. He hands the knife to SAM.]
SAM
Conjuncti sumus, [SAM cuts his arm while saying the incantation] unum sumus. [BOBBY and SAM grip each other's wrist, BOBBY turns into a stream of red and white light that shoots into SAM's arm through the cut.] All right. Come on, Benny. It's your turn. [SAM turns to BENNY, he holds the hilt of the knife out for BENNY to take.] Hurry up.
VAMPIRE
Benny. [Another group of vampires approach.] And still working with the Winchesters.
SAM
Hurry.
BENNY
Time for you to go, Sam. [BENNY pats SAM on the shoulder and walks towards the new threat.]
SAM
Benny?
BENNY
Go on. It's me they want. Go on. You just make sure you tell Dean I said goodbye. I was never any good up there anyway.
SAM
Benny, wait! [SAM tosses the Purgatory weapon to BENNY who uses it to take out the closest vampire. The other two vampires attack BENNY. SAM climbs up the hill to the portal. He looks back to see BENNY down on the ground fighting.] Benny? [SAM is sucked through the portal.]
EXT. 100-MILE WILDERNESS, MAINE - NIGHT
DEAN is walking through the woods, there's a bright flash of light and SAM is there. He walks over to DEAN. DEAN grabs him into a hug.
DEAN
Purgatory, right? A real garden spot, ain't it?
SAM
Yeah.
DEAN
Did you get him out?
SAM
Only Bobby.
DEAN
What? I mean, that's fantastic about Bobby.
SAM
Dean, look – Benny, uh... He got us out. A bunch of vamps showed, and he used himself as bait. I get the feeling that even if that didn't happen, he didn't want to come back, you know? I'm sorry.
DEAN
You're probably right. So, uh... Bobby – how – how'd he hold up down there?
SAM
He's good, all things considered. Ornery as hell, of course.
DEAN
As he should be. Let's put that old man where he belongs.
SAM
Yeah. [SAM pulls up his jacket sleeve, knife in hand.] Solvo haec phantasmata in terram [we see the glowing yellow and red light writhing under the skin, while SAM says the incantation], et inde ad olympum. [SAM holds his arm up, the light is now a bluish/white that starts to rise up into the sky. Suddenly it turns into a cloudy mix of red and black.]
DEAN
What the hell?
CROWLEY (V O)
Hello, boys. [Scene pulls back to show CROWLEY standing close by. He looks upwards.] Bobby Singer – I'd know you anywhere.
DEAN
Let him go, Crowley. He doesn't belong in Hell.
CROWLEY
He does if I say he does. He's inflicted untold damage on my kind. From where I sit, actually, Hell's too good for him. Really? [SAM and DEAN rush CROWLEY who just flicks his index finger. SAM and DEAN are flung away until they're slammed, held motionless against two large tree trunks where they dangle several feet off the ground. CROWLEY looks up at BOBBY's red/black cloud-like soul that's now starting to come back down towards earth.] What? [BOBBY's soul now has flashes of white light shooting through it. We see NAOMI standing there, a pleased look on her face.] Oh, come on!
NAOMI
Let me see if I've interpreted the situation correctly. The Winchesters have freed an innocent from Hell, to which you are wrongfully trying to return it.
CROWLEY
Siding with them, Naomi? You don't know those two. Before they're done, we'll both be locked away.
NAOMI
I'm just hoping they lock you away, dear. The rest I'll figure out.
CROWLEY
Bureaucrat. You're fighting outside your weight class.
NAOMI
Don't call me a bureaucrat. [NAOMI extends her hand towards CROWLEY, her eyes and hand shining with angel power. CROWLEY disappears. DEAN and SAM, released from the trees, plummet to the ground. NAOMI raises her hand upwards, BOBBY's soul turns blue and white, then shoots up into the sky, to heaven. She looks at DEAN.] I told you you could trust me. [She wings out.]
SAM
What the hell was that about?
DEAN
I'll tell you later. Let's get this trial done. [SAM takes the scrap of paper out of his pocket, intones the Enochian phrase.]
SAM
Kah-nuh-ahm-dahr. [SAM grabs his right hand, falls to his knees in agony. His hand looks like it's burning on the inside, he makes a fist as the burning light fades.]
DEAN
Sam? What? What?! Talk to me! What?! [DEAN grabs SAM's shoulder.]
SAM
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay. I'm fine. It's done. It's done.
ACT FIVE
INT. GARTH'S BOAT - NIGHT
KEVIN is painting sigils on the boat's windows, the room lit by multiple candles.
CROWLEY (V O)
So tired of this, aren't you, Kevin? Fear, the hiding. I know I am.
KEVIN
Just a dream. It's just a dream. [He puts down the brush, hears screaming, grabs his head, the windows shatter, covering everything with broken glass. We see fingers extinguish a candle.]
CROWLEY
Kevin Tran. [KEVIN drops his hands from covering his head.] It's been a while. [He turns to see CROWLEY.] Thought you could elude me forever? There's always a way. If you can't find one Tran, find another. Your mom, she didn't want to give you up. Quite a pain threshold, that one. But even she could only take so much.
KEVIN
She never would have told you.
CROWLEY
Moms are like that, aren't they? So we killed her and got your address off her smartphone.
KEVIN
No!!
CROWLEY
What you people never seem to understand is that you are nothing! Fleeting blips of light. I am forever. [Scene pans out to show the boat Fizzles' Folly under a full moon. We hear KEVIN screaming in the background.]
EXT. IMPALA - NIGHT
DEAN
You okay?
SAM
Yeah, I'll live.
DEAN
I buried Benny... but I didn't burn his bones. After he said he'd try to get you out of there, it just didn't seem right. I know you got no use for him, but –
SAM
No, no, no. You know what? I get it. I do. He's a... He's a little different from what I thought. So, go ahead and leave the door open if you want.
DEAN
All right, well, let's go check in with Prophet boy and see where he stashed that tablet.
INT. GARTH'S BOAT - NIGHT
DEAN
Kevin? It's us. [DEAN and SAM enter, it's dark inside. They turn on flashlights.] Kevin! [The scene pulls back to show an empty room, devoid of everything, nothing on the desk. DEAN turns on the lights, the walls, counters, everything is bare, the windows are intact, complete with sigils.]
SAM
Kevin? He's gone. He took all our stuff, his notes...
DEAN
I saw this coming. Finally freaked. Little geek made a run for it.
SAM
Yeah, but where?
