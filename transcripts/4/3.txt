TEASER

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN is asleep. SAM pauses and looks at him before leaving the room.


EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

A car pulls up. SAM gets in the passenger side. RUBY is driving.

RUBY
Ready?

SAM
Definitely.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN is dreaming. We see flashes of his terrified face, in red, and the sound of screams. He wakes to find CASTIEL sitting on his bed.

CASTIEL
Hello, Dean. What were you dreaming about?

DEAN
What, do you get your freak on by watching other people sleep? What do you want?

CASTIEL
Listen to me. You have to stop it.

DEAN
Stop what?

CASTIEL puts two fingers to DEAN's forehead.


EXT. STREET – DAY

DEAN is sleeping on a bench.

POLICE OFFICER
Move it buddy – you can't sleep here.

DEAN
Okay... sleep... where?

POLICE OFFICER
Anywhere but here.

Dean tries to make a call on his cell, but gets no signal.

DEAN
Perfect.

DEAN gets up and enters 'JAY BIRD'S DINER'.


INT. DINER - DAY

DEAN sits at the diner's counter next to a YOUNG MAN.

DEAN
Hey, where the hell am I?

YOUNG MAN
Jay Bird's Diner.

DEAN
Yeah, thanks. I mean, uh... city and state.

YOUNG MAN
Lawrence, Kansas.

DEAN
Lawrence.

YOUNG MAN
Hey, you okay buddy?

DEAN
Yeah, tough night.

YOUNG MAN
Hey, uh, coffee here, Reg.

REG
Okay, coming right up.

DEAN pulls his cell phone from his pocket.

DEAN
Can you tell me where I can get reception on this thing?

YOUNG MAN
The USS Enterprise?

DEAN looks at REG as he brings the coffee over. REG is dressed in 1970s hippie gear – think early Sonny Bono.

DEAN
Thanks... nice threads. You know Sonny and Cher broke up, right?

YOUNG MAN
Sonny and Cher broke up?

DEAN looks around the diner and notices everyone is dressed in 1970s-era clothes. He looks at the newspaper the YOUNG MAN is reading. The headline reads “Nixon accepts resignation of top…” and the date is Monday, April 30, 1973. DEAN mouths the words “Seventy three.” A MAN enters the diner.

MAN
Hey, Winchester.

DEAN and the YOUNG MAN look around. The MAN shakes the hand of the YOUNG MAN.

MAN
Son of a bitch. How you doing, Corporal?

YOUNG MAN
Hey, Mr. D.

MR. D.
I heard you were back.

YOUNG MAN
Yeah, a little while now.

MR. D.
Good to have you home, John, damn good.

DEAN
Dad?

MR. D.
Well, say hello to your old man for me.

JOHN
You got it, Mr. D.

JOHN notices DEAN staring at him.

JOHN
Do we know each other?

DEAN
I guess not.

JOHN gets up to leave.

JOHN
Take it easy, pal.

DEAN
Yeah.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)

ACT ONE

EXT. STREET - DAY

DEAN is following JOHN WINCHESTER. As he turns a corner, DEAN bumps into CASTIEL.

DEAN
What is this?

CASTIEL
What does it look like?

DEAN
Is it real?

CASTIEL
Very.

DEAN
Okay, so what? Angels got their hands on some DeLoreans? How did I get here?

CASTIEL
Time is fluid, Dean. It's not easy, but we can bend it on occasion.

DEAN
Well bend it back or tell me what the hell I'm doing here!

CASTIEL
I told you, you have to stop it.

DEAN
Stop what? Huh? What, is there something nasty after my Dad?

DEAN turns as a car horn sounds. When he turns back, CASTIEL is gone.

DEAN
Oh, come on! What, are you allergic to straight answers, you son of a bitch?!


EXT. RAINBOW MOTORS CAR DEALERSHIP

JOHN is talking to a CAR SALESMAN.

CAR SALESMAN
A fine young man like yourself, just starting out? How about I take off another 250?

JOHN considers it for a moment.

JOHN
Let's do it.

CAR SALESMAN
I'll get the paperwork.

JOHN walks over to the front of a beige VW van and rubs the headlights.

DEAN
That's not the one you want.

DEAN is leaning on a ’67 Chevy Impala!

JOHN
You following me?

DEAN
No, no, I was just passing by. I never got to thank you for that cup of coffee this morning. I was a little out of it.

JOHN
More than a little.

DEAN
Let me repay the favor.

DEAN pats the hood of the IMPALA.

DEAN
This is the one you want.

JOHN
Oh yeah, you – you know something about cars?

DEAN nods his head and looks slightly nostalgic.

DEAN
Yeah... yeah, my Dad taught me everything I know.

DEAN
And this – this is a great car.

DEAN opens the hood of the IMPALA and leans in. JOHN joins him on the side of the car.

DEAN
327 four barrel, 275 horses. A little TLC and this thing is cherry.

JOHN
You know man, you're right.

DEAN nods over his shoulder at the van.

DEAN
Then what are you buying that thing for?

JOHN
I kinda promised someone I would.

DEAN
Over a '67 Chevy? I mean, come on, this is the car of a lifetime. Trust me, this thing's still gonna be badass when it's 40.

JOHN considers it for a moment and hold out his hand to DEAN.

JOHN
John Winchester. Thanks.

DEAN shakes his hand.

DEAN
Dean Van Halen – and thank you.

JOHN looks in the open windows of the IMPALA.

DEAN
I was in pretty rough shape this morning, huh?

JOHN
No kidding.

DEAN
I've been hung over before but, hey, I was, I was getting chills in that diner. You didn't feel any of those cold spots, did you?

JOHN
Nope.

DEAN
I swore I smelled something weird too, you know? Like... like rotten eggs. You didn't happen to smell any sulfur by chance?

JOHN
No.

DEAN
No... There been any cattle mutilations in town recently?

JOHN
Okay, mister! Stop it.

DEAN
Yeah, if only I knew what to stop. Listen, uh – watch out for yourself okay?

JOHN
Yeah, sure.

DEAN pats the IMPALA again and leaves.

CAR SALESMAN
So?

JOHN points at the IMPALA.

JOHN
I'll take this one.


EXT. SUBURBAN STREET

JOHN pulls up in the IMPALA. Further down the street DEAN pulls up. He watches as a young woman runs from a house to JOHN'S car.

JOHN
Hey.

GIRL
What's this?

JOHN
My car.

The GIRL walks around the back of the car, and JOHN follows her.

GIRL
What happened to the van?

JOHN
Mary, this is better than the van! This has got a 327, a four barrel carburetor.

DEAN
Mom?


EXT. DINER - NIGHT

MARY and JOHN are inside with milkshakes. DEAN watches them through a window.

DEAN
Sammy, wherever you are, Mom is a babe. I'm going to hell... again.


INT. DINER - NIGHT

JOHN and MARY are sitting across from one another talking over milkshakes.

JOHN
I should just talk to him.

MARY
My Dad's being my Dad, John. It's not you.

JOHN
How is it not me? He's been like this for how many years?

MARY
He's just protective over me, that's all. He doesn't want me to –

JOHN
Hook up with a mechanic from a family of mechanics?

MARY
No! Hey, I love you, for exactly what you are. I'll be right back.

MARY leaves. JOHN pulls out a small red box. Inside is a ring.


EXT. DINER - NIGHT

MARY is standing behind DEAN.

MARY
Why are you following us?

DEAN turns around. MARY knees him in the stomach and throws him against a metal container next to the building. She goes to punch him, and he dodges it, stepping sideways.

DEAN
Are you crazy?

MARY continues her attack. DEAN backs up as she comes after him, but he manages to grab her arms.

MARY
You've been trailing us since my house.

DEAN
I don't know what you're talking about –

MARY
Really?

MARY and DEAN grapple. DEAN grabs her and holds her against a wall.

DEAN
Okay, how about we talk about this, huh?

MARY
Let me go!

DEAN sees MARY is wearing a bracelet with protective charms.

DEAN
Are you a hunter?


ACT TWO

EXT. CAMPBELLS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

JOHN and MARY pull up in the IMPALA.

JOHN
See you later?

MARY
If you're lucky.

They kiss and MARY gets out of the car. As she approaches the house DEAN appears.

MARY
Dean, right? I'm not sure you should come in.

DEAN
You can trust me. I mean, come on, we're all hunters, right? I mean, we're – we're practically family.

MARY
Yeah, thing is, my Dad, he's a little, um...

DEAN
Oh, I gotta meet him.

MARY
You've heard of him?

DEAN
Clearly not enough.


INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT

SAMUEL
So, you're a hunter? Well, tell me something, mister hunter, you kill vampires with wooden stakes or silver?

DEAN
Neither, you cut their heads off.

MARY smiles.

DEAN
So, did I pass your test?

SAMUEL
Yep. Now get out of my house.

MARY
Dad!

SAMUEL
I don't trust other hunters, Dean, don't want their help, don't want them around my family.

DEANNA is setting the table in the next room, and calls to SAMUEL.

DEANNA
Knock it off, Samuel.

SAMUEL
He's a hunter.

DEANNA walks into the room.

DEANNA
Who passed your little pop quiz, and now I am inviting him to dinner. Are you hungry?

DEAN
Starving.

DEANNA
Good. I'm Deanna, you've met my husband Samuel, now wash up.

DEAN looks at MARY.

DEAN
Samuel and Deanna?

MARY nods.

DEAN
Really?


INT. CAMPBELL HOME - NIGHT

DEAN, MARY, SAMUEL and DEANNA are sitting around the dining room table eating dinner. DEANNA leans over and touches DEAN's arm.

DEANNA
First time in Lawrence, Dean?

DEAN
Well, it's been a while. Things sure have changed... I think.

SAMUEL
You working a job?

DEAN
Yeah, maybe.

SAMUEL
What's that mean?

DEAN
It means I don't trust other hunters either, Samuel.

MARY
Hey, um, so why were you following me and John?

DEAN
Mmm, I thought something was after your, um, boyfriend, but um, I don't think that anymore.

DEANNA
John Winchester mixing it up with spirits, can you imagine?

MARY
I saw that.

SAMUEL
What?

MARY
That sour lemon look.

SAMUEL
Now hold on, John's a really, really nice... naive civilian.

MARY
So what? You'd rather me be with a guy like this?

She nods to DEAN.

DEAN
What? No, no. No.

SAMUEL
Mary, of course not, it's just that I –

DEANNA
That's enough, both of you, we have company.

DEAN
So what about you, Samuel, you, uh, working a job?

SAMUEL
Might be.

MARY
He's working a job on the Whitshire Farm.

SAMUEL gives MARY a look as DEAN clears his throat.

DEAN
Whitshire, why does that name sound familiar to me?

SAMUEL
Well, it's been all over the papers. Tom Whitshire. Got tangled up in a combine a few towns over.

DEAN
That kind of thing happens.

SAMUEL
So why was he on it in the first place when his crops are all dead?

DEAN
Demonic omens?

SAMUEL
That's what I gotta find out.

DEAN
What about the rest of the town? Well, did you find anything on the web? ...Of information that you have assembled.

DEANNA
Electrical storms maybe. The weather service graphs should be here on Friday.

DEAN
By mail?

SAMUEL
No, we hired a jet liner to fly 'em to us overnight.

DEAN
You know, it sounds to me like we might be hunting the same thing. You know if we go in there in numbers, we could take care of this real quick.

SAMUEL
What part of “we work alone” do you not understand, son?


EXT. WHITSHIRE HOME - DAY

MARY and SAMUEL are sitting in a truck.

MARY
And I'm here because?

SAMUEL
Family business, Mary... family.

SAMUEL
What? You'd rather be waving pom-poms at a bunch of dumb jocks?

MARY sees a boy leaning on a tree nearby and walks towards him.

SAMUEL
Where you goin'?

MARY
To do the job, Dad.

SAMUEL walks to the house and knocks on the door. DEAN opens the door, dressed as a priest.

SAMUEL
Father, I see you beat me here.

DEAN
The Lord is funny that way. Beth Whitshire, this is my associate, our senior, senior priest, Father Chaney.

DEAN joins SAMUEL outside on the doorstep.

SAMUEL
Please accept our deepest condolences on behalf of the county diocese.

BETH
Thank you.

DEAN
Mrs. Whitshire was just telling me all about Tom, and how normal and ordinary things were the day before his death.

SAMUEL
I see, so you didn't notice anything unusual, ma’am?

BETH
You mean like my husband’s guts fertilizing the back 40?

SAMUEL is stunned into silence at her response, and DEAN, looking amused, turns to leave.

DEAN
Excuse me.

DEAN pats SAMUEL on the back and then makes his way off the porch. SAMUEL shares an awkward smile with BETH, and we see DEAN approaching MARY and the boy, CHARLIE. MARY notices DEAN and turns back to CHARLIE.

MARY
Charlie, would you like to tell the Father here what you just told me?

CHARLIE
Dad drank sometimes. Sometimes he got rough with Mom.

MARY
And that's when the stranger came?

CHARLIE
I just thought he was some Bible thumper, like you all. He showed up about a week ago.

DEAN
Saying what?

CHARLIE
Did I want the beatings to stop? I just thought he was crazy, I didn't think – and the next thing I know, Dad's dead. Am I going to jail?

MARY
You didn't do this, Charlie.

DEAN
Did the stranger want something in return?

CHARLIE
He didn't want anything.

DEAN
Come on, Chuck, he wasn't just handing out freebies now, was he?

CHARLIE
He did say something about comin' a callin' ten years from now. Maybe he'd want something then.

DEAN
Something like what?

CHARLIE
I don't know, okay? Look, I told you he was nuts.

MARY grabs DEAN's arm and leads him a few steps away.

MARY
What do you think?

DEAN
I think he just pimped his soul to a demon and doesn't even know it.

MARY returns to CHARLIE, and DEAN follows her.

MARY
Charlie, do you remember what this stranger looked like?

CHARLIE
Yeah, he was about 5’10, white, normal looking really.

MARY
Anything else?

CHARLIE
There was one thing.

DEAN
What?

CHARLIE
It's just, the light hit his eyes in a weird way and... for a moment I coulda sworn –

DEAN
What? That they were black? Or red maybe?

CHARLIE
No, they were yellow. Pale yellow.

DEAN looks over at MARY.


INT. CAMPBELL HOME - NIGHT

DEAN slams a map down on the dining room table. DEANNA is in the kitchen chopping bananas.

SAMUEL
What do you say we just slow down and talk this thing through.

DEAN
There's nothing to talk about.

SAMUEL
Except you're saying it's a demon, and none of us has ever heard of a demon with yellow eyes.

DEAN
Yeah, well, I have. This thing killed my family.

SAMUEL
Just calm down, son.

DEAN
You don't get it, do you? You are in danger, we are all in danger. In fact, you need to get yourself someplace safe.

SAMUEL
Not until we know what we're dealing with here.

DEANNA comes in carrying a fruit salad.

DEANNA
Sam's right, Dean, it could be a demon, it could be a shapeshifter, it could be any number of things.

DEAN
I know what this thing is!

DEANNA goes back into the kitchen.

DEAN
And I'm gonna kill it, that's all the talking I need to do.

SAMUEL
You're gonna kill a demon? How?

DEAN
There's a hunter named Daniel Elkins. He lives in Colorado, he has Colt's gun. The Colt.

SAMUEL
Yeah, I heard about the Colt, used to tell it to Mary as a bedtime story.

DEAN
Well, it's real.

SAMUEL looks at DEANNA. They don't know what to think.

SAMUEL
Alright, say that it is. You got some kind of crystal ball telling you where this demon's gonna be?

DEAN
Yeah, maybe I do.

DEAN takes JOHN's journal out of his jacket and flips it open on the table.

SAMUEL
What's this?

DEAN
It's a list.

SAMUEL
Of what?

DEAN
My Dad wrote down anyone he thought ever came in contact with the Yellow Eyed Demon: who, where and when.

SAMUEL
Why?

DEAN
‘Cause the more he could learn about the son of a bitch, the more he could figure out why it killed my Mom.

DEAN flips the page.

DEAN
Look, Whitshire Farm. I told you that name sounded familiar.

SAMUEL
Whitshire Farms, that was two days ago. How the hell is that on your Dad's list?

DEAN
Uh... my Dad could see the future. Look at this, it says he's gonna hit here tomorrow night.

SAMUEL
Liddy Walsh?

DEAN
Haleyville, that's close.

SAMUEL
I mean, yeah, it's about three miles, but...

SAMUEL looks over at DEANNA leaning on the door jamb, and she shakes her head slightly at the whole story. SAMUEL looks back at DEAN, who sees that they don't believe him.

DEAN
I know you guys think I'm crazy.

SAMUEL
You seem like a really nice kid, Dean, but yeah, you're crazy.

DEAN
Yeah, maybe, but I know where this bastard's gonna be, and I'm gonna stop it, once and for all.

DEAN takes the journal and walks out of the room.


INT. CAMPBELL HOME - NIGHT

MARY is sitting listening to music.

DEAN
I'm shoving off. I just wanted to say, bye.

MARY
Really? So soon?

DEAN
Yeah – job to do. Hey, I wanted to – to tell you, you know for what it's worth. Um... it doesn't matter what your Dad thinks, I like that John kid.

MARY smiles.

MARY
You do?

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, I think you two are meant to be.

DEAN (softly)
Hell, I'm depending on it.

MARY
What?

DEAN
Nothing. Um, can I ask you a question?

MARY nods.

DEAN
What's he like? John.

MARY
Why do you ask?

DEAN
Just curious.

MARY
I don't know. He's sweet, kind. Even after the war, after everything, he still believes in happily ever after, you know? He's everything a hunter isn't. (beat) No offense.

DEAN
No, none taken.

MARY
Can I tell you something?

DEAN nods.

MARY
He's gonna ask me to marry him. Tomorrow, I think!

DEAN
Yeah?

MARY
Oh, Dad's gonna explode, but I don't care. I'll run away if I have to, I just… I love John, and...

DEAN
And what?

MARY
I wanna get out. This job, this life, I hate it. I want a family, I wanna be safe. You know the worst thing I can think of? The very worst thing? Is for my children to be raised into this like I was. No, I won't let it happen.

DEAN blinks back tears.

DEAN
Yeah...

MARY
Hey, are you okay?

DEAN
Yeah, no, I'm – I'm fine. Hey, uh, Mary, can I tell you something?

MARY
Sure.

DEAN
Even if this sounds really weird. Will you promise me that you will remember?

MARY
Okay.

DEAN
On November 2nd, 1983, don't get out of bed. No matter what you hear, or what you see. Promise me you won't get out of bed.

MARY
Okay.

A tear runs down DEAN’s face. He smiles at MARY and leaves.


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

DEAN is driving. CASTIEL appears next to him. DEAN inhales sharply.

DEAN
So what? God's my co-pilot, is that it?

CASTIEL just looks at him, and DEAN glances over again.

DEAN
Well, you're a regular Chatty Cathy. Tell me something. Sam would have wanted in on this, why not bring him back?

CASTIEL
You had to do this alone, Dean.

DEAN
And you don't care that he's tearing up the future looking for me right now?

CASTIEL
Sam's not looking for you.

DEAN
Alright, if I do this, then the family curse breaks, right? Mom and Dad live happily ever after, and – and, Sam and I grow up playing little league and chasing tail?

CASTIEL
You realize, if you do alter the future, your father, you, Sam – you'll never become hunters. And all those people you saved, they'll die.

DEAN
I realize.

CASTIEL
And you don't care?

DEAN
Oh, I care. I care a lot, but these are my parents. I'm not gonna let them die again. I can't. No, not if I can stop it.

DEAN looks over to the passenger seat, but CASTIEL is gone.


ACT THREE

INT. ELKINS HOME - DAY

DEAN is kneeling at a safe, from which he pulls out the Colt. A man, DANIEL ELKINS, appears with a shotgun pointed at DEAN's back.

DANIEL
Hold it right there, friend. Drop the gun, be on your way.

DEAN pretends to lay the Colt on the top of the safe, but instead points it at DANIEL.

DEAN
Can't do it, Daniel.

DANIEL
Who the hell are you?

DEAN
A hunter, just like yourself.

DANIEL
Thief's more like it.

DEAN
I just need it for a few days.

DANIEL
Not happening, mister.

DEAN
Look, I have a chance to save my family’s lives. My family. But I need this gun to do it. So if you want to stop me? Kill me.

DEAN lowers the Colt and walks slowly toward the door past DANIEL. He turns to look at DANIEL and DANIEL lowers his gun.

DEAN
There's some hunters in Lawrence, the Campbells.

DANIEL
Never heard of them.

DEAN
That's where she'll be.


INT. CAMPBELL HOME - NIGHT

MARY and SAMUEL are sitting at the dining room table cleaning guns.

MARY
Dean say where he was going?

SAMUEL
Said he was gonna kill a demon.

MARY chuckles.

MARY
Kill a demon? That's impossible.

SAMUEL
Yep.

MARY
Where?

SAMUEL
Uh... oh, I don' know, over in Haleyville, uh, Walsh's maybe.

MARY
Wait, not Liddy Walsh?

SAMUEL
Well, yeah, I- I- I think so.

MARY
Dad, she's a friend of mine! We gotta help her.

DEANNA walks to the door of the room, and sees MARY getting up.

DEANNA
What's wrong?

MARY
I'll be in the car.

DEANNA
Hey –

SAMUEL
I mean, she wants to hunt, she doesn't want to hunt, is this some female time of month thing?

DEANNA sighs and walks back into the other room.

SAMUEL
What?


INT. WALSH'S HOME - NIGHT

LIDDY WALSH is sitting on the sofa with DR. BROWN.

DR. BROWN
I'm sorry, Liddy, it's metastasized.

LIDDY
Where?

DR. BROWN
His liver, his lungs. It's time we talked about arrangements.

LIDDY
No, you have to do something, Dr. Brown.

DR. BROWN
There is one way, a cure actually, but I'll need your help.

LIDDY
What do I have to do?

DR. BROWN
Nothing. Just in ten years, I'm going to come to you and ask for something then.

LIDDY
What?

DR. BROWN
Nothing you'll miss.

DR. BROWN’s eyes turn yellow. The door bursts open and SAMUEL enters. He shoots the YED in the chest. LIDDY screams. The YED’s eyes open and SAMUEL cocks the shotgun again. The YED waves his hand and SAMUEL’s shotgun flies across the room.

LIDDY
Oh –

The YED waves his other hand. SAMUEL flies backwards and gets pinned to the wall behind him.

LIDDY
Oh, God.

YED
Hold that thought.

The YED approaches SAMUEL.

SAMUEL
You son of a bich.

The YED leans in to SAMUEL, but turns around abruptly. MARY is standing behind him with a raised knife. The YED grabs Mary by the throat.

YED
Hello there.

MARY slices him with the knife.

YED
Where the hell have they been hiding you?

MARY keeps attacking. The YED grabs her arm and she drops the knife. She punches him.

YED
I like you. You got a lot of spunk.

MARY kicks the YED. He grabs her leg, then slams her against a wall.

SAMUEL
Mary!

DEAN bursts in with the Colt drawn. The YED pulls MARY in front of him as a shield.

DEAN
Let her go!

YED
Where'd you get that gun?

DEAN cocks the COLT and nods to MARY, who breaks away from the YED. Black smoke pours from the YED’s mouth and goes out a vent in the wall.

DEAN
Damn...


EXT. WALSH HOME - NIGHT

DEAN
Mary, what else did he say to you?

MARY
I told you, just that he liked me.

MARY looks up at DEAN with fear in her eyes.

MARY
What did he mean by that?

SAMUEL joins them on the lawn.

SAMUEL
Liddy's a strong kid, she'll be fine.

SAMUEL looks at MARY.

SAMUEL
Are you okay?

MARY
No, Dad, I'm pretty far from okay. Can we go?

MARY turns and walks to the truck. SAMUEL turns to DEAN.

SAMUEL
Nice job in there.

DEAN
I missed the shot.

SAMUEL
Take the compliment, son. I'm saying that I was wrong about you.

DEAN looks at him, and then to the truck where MARY went, and looks back at SAMUEL, obviously upset.

DEAN
We need to talk alone.


INT. CAMPBELL HOME - NIGHT

DEAN
We have to kill this thing now, or Mary dies.

SAMUEL
What? How do you know that?

DEAN pulls out JOHN's journal.

DEAN
I just do, okay?

SAMUEL
When?

DEAN
I don't know, maybe today, probably years from now, but it's happening, trust me.

SAMUEL
So what, are you some kind of a psychic now too?

DEAN
No. Alright, listen to me.

DEAN goes to the table and sits down next to SAMUEL.

DEAN
Now, this is gonna sound a little... actually it's gonna sound massively, massively crazy.

SAMUEL
Okay.

DEAN
Mary is my mother.

SAMUEL
Excuse me?

DEAN
And I am your grandson, and I know what the hell I'm talking about.

SAMUEL looks at him in disbelief.

SAMUEL
You wanna run that by me again, son?

DEAN
My real name is Dean Winchester. I was born January 24th, 1979. My parents are Mary and John Winchester.

SAMUEL
I don't have to listen to this.

DEAN
Mary gets killed by a yellow eyed demon in 1983, and I think that this – what happened tonight – I think this is the moment that he caught her scent. Now, if we don't catch this thing now, and kill it, and it gets away? Then Mary dies. So I am asking you, please.


EXT. CAMPBELL HOME - NIGHT

MARY runs up to JOHN and throws herself into his arms.

JOHN
Hey, you – you okay?

MARY
You promised you'd take me away.

JOHN
Of course I did.

MARY
Do it now.

JOHN opens the door of his car. MARY climbs in, and he shuts it after her, looking concerned.


INT. CAMPBELL HOME - NIGHT

DEAN
How did I know about the Colt? Huh? How did I know about the Yellow Eyed Demon? Or where it would be? I'm not making this up, Samuel.

SAMUEL
Every bone in my body is aching to put you six feet under, but there's something about you – I can't shake it. Now, I may be crazier than you, son, but I believe you.

DEAN
Thank you.

SAMUEL
I mean, how do we find this bastard?

DEAN
Right here, the list.

DEAN opens JOHN's journal.

SAMUEL
And with the Colt?

DEAN pulls the Colt out of his jacket and puts it on the table.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAMUEL
Here, let me see it.

DEAN hesitates and then moves it further away from SAMUEL.

DEAN
Sorry, I don't let anybody hold it.

SAMUEL
I'm your grandfather.

DEAN
Nothing personal.

SAMUEL
Sure it is, especially when it's me you're trying to kill.

SAMUEL's eyes turn yellow. The YED raises his hand and the chair that DEAN is sitting slams against the wall. DEAN glares, but appears unable to move.


ACT FOUR

INT. CAMPBELL HOME - NIGHT

YED
Future boy, huh?

The YED walks over to DEAN.

YED
I only know one thing that's got the juice to swing something like that. You must have friends in high places. So, I kill your Mommy? That's why you came all this way? To see little old me?

DEAN
Oh, I came here to kill you.

YED
Hey, wait a minute, if that slut Mary's your Mommy, are you... are you one of my psychic kids?

The YED leans in and sniffs DEAN.

YED
No, not you. Maybe you got a sis, or a bro. That's terrific, means it all worked out. After all, it's why I'm here.

DEAN
So that's what this is about, these deals you're making. You don't want these people's souls.

YED
No, I just want their children. I'm here to choose the perfect parents, like your Mommy.

DEAN
Why her? Why any of them?

YED
Because they're strong.

DEANNA peeks around the corner of the kitchen doorway and sees what is happening.

YED
They're pure, and they eat their Wheaties. My own little master race – they're ideal breeders.

DEAN furrows his brow.

YED
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter. No one’s breeding with me. Though, Mary? Man, I'd like to make an exception. So far, she's my favorite.

DEAN looks furious and tries to move, but can’t. DEANNA watches from the next room.

DEAN
So why make the deals?

YED
I need permission.

DEANNA comes quietly into the room.

YED
I need to be invited, into their houses, I know, I know, the – the red tape'll drive you nuts, but in ten short years, it'll all be worth it. ‘Cause you know what I'm gonna do to your sibling? I'm gonna stand over their crib and I'm gonna bleed into their mouth. Demon blood is better than Ovaltine, vitamins, minerals – it makes you big and strong.

DEAN
For what? So they can lead your discount demon army? Is that your big plan?

YED
Please, my end game's a hell of a lot bigger than that kid.

DEAN
End game? What end game?

YED
Like I'm gonna tell you, or those angels sitting on your shoulder. No, I'm gonna cover my tracks good.

DEAN
You can cover whatever the hell you want, but I'm still gonna kill you.

YED
Right. Now that, I'd like to see.

DEAN
Maybe not today, but you look into my eyes, you son of a bitch, ‘cause I'm the one that kills you.

YED
So, you're gonna save everybody, is that right? Is that it? Well, I'll tell you one person that you're not gonna save.

The YED takes out a knife.

YED
Your Grandpappy.

The YED winks and plunges the knife into SAMUEL.

DEAN
No!

DEANNA
No!

The YED goes for DEANNA, while DEAN struggles to free himself. The YED sends DEANNA flying and breaks her neck in the kitchen as she tries to crawl away. DEAN grabs the Colt and rushes in to find her dead, and the YED gone.

DEAN
Mary... Mary!


EXT. IMPALA - NIGHT

JOHN and MARY sit in the IMPALA, which is parked next to a river.

JOHN
I guess it's no secret why I brought you way out here.


INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

MARY
John –

JOHN
I just – just let me get through this, okay?

MARY
Okay, wait. There's things you don't know about me, John.

JOHN
So?

JOHN opens the ring box and shows it to her.

JOHN
I will always love you for exactly who you are.

There is a bang at the window.

YED
What did I tell you?

MARY
Dad!

JOHN
Sir, just listen!

The YED pulls MARY out of the car. JOHN gets out the other side.

MARY
Ow! Dad! You're hurting me!

JOHN runs over and tries to pull the YED off MARY.

JOHN
Hey, take it easy!

The YED grabs JOHN’s head and wrenches it sideways, breaking his neck and killing him instantly.

MARY
No!

JOHN falls to the ground. MARY drops to her knees to cradle him. The YED kicks JOHN’s legs.

MARY
You killed him.

YED
Oh, not just John, sweetie-pie. Mommy and Daddy too.

The YED unzips his jacket to show MARY the knife wound in SAMUEL’s stomach.

MARY
No...

YED
Yup, afraid so. You're little orphan Mary now.

MARY
You son of a bitch!

YED
Oh, sticks and stones may break my bones, and they won't bring your family back either.

MARY
I'll kill you, I swear to God.

YED
Oh, let's not get nasty.

The YED sits down next to MARY.

YED
Now look, we both said some things that we regret. Let's, um... kiss and make up.

MARY is crying as she holds JOHN.

YED
I'll tell you what, I'll arrange to have lover boy here brought back breathing.

MARY
My parents too?

YED
Nope, sorry doll, that's not on the table. But, think about it, you could be done with hunting forever. The white picket fence, station wagon, couple of kids, no more monsters or fear. I'll make sure of it.

MARY
What? And all it costs is my soul?

YED
Oh, no, you can keep your soul, I just need permission.

MARY
For what?

YED
Mmm, in ten years I need to swing by your house for a little something, that's all.

MARY
For what?!

YED
Relax. As long as I'm not interrupted, nobody gets hurt, I promise. (beat) Or you can spend the rest of your life, desperate and alone.

Mary is sobbing.

YED
Mary? It's a good deal. So what do you say?

DEAN drives up and sees the YED kissing MARY. He gets out of the car.

DEAN
No!

DEAN rushes forward with the Colt drawn. Before he can shoot, black smoke flows from the YED’s mouth. JOHN comes back to life.

JOHN
Mary?

MARY
John.

CASTIEL appears beside DEAN and places a hand on his shoulder. When Mary looks up from JOHN, DEAN is gone. SAMUEL lies dead on the ground.


ACT FIVE

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

DEAN is asleep in bed. He gasps and wakes up. CASTIEL is standing near the foot of the bed. DEAN sits up.

DEAN
I couldn't stop any of it. She still made the deal. She still died in the nursery, didn't she?

CASTIEL
Don't be too hard on yourself. You couldn't have stopped it.

DEAN stands up.

DEAN
What?

CASTIEL
Destiny can't be changed, Dean. All roads lead to the same destination.

DEAN
Then why'd you send me back?

CASTIEL
For the truth. Now you know everything we do.

DEAN
What the hell are you talking about?

CASTIEL looks at the other bed, which hasn’t been slept in, and DEAN follows his gaze.

DEAN
Where's Sam?

CASTIEL
We know what Azazel did to your brother. What we don't know is why – what his endgame is. He went to great lengths to cover that up.

DEAN
Where's Sam?

CASTIEL
425 Waterman.

DEAN grabs his keys and his jacket.

CASTIEL
You brother is headed down a dangerous road, Dean, and we're not sure where it leads. So stop it. Or we will.
