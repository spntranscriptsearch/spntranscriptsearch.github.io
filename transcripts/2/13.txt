TEASER
SUBTITLE
Providence, Rhode Island

A young woman (GLORIA) is sitting in a dark room, watching television (it appears to be "The Drew Carey Show") and smoking. She wears smudged hooker makeup and the table to her left holds several small angel statues and an ashtray filled with cigarette butts.

DIALOGUE ON TV:
WOMAN
How little?


DREW
How about "a little eyeshadow"?
(LAUGHTRACK)
You know, all this stuff, it's just very unprofessional.


MIMI
Don't touch the troll!


DREW
Is that what your mom used to say to your dates?
(LAUGHTRACK)


MIMI
Put the trolls down or I'll put a staple right between your-

GLORIA sighs heavily and lifts the remote control. As we pan over to reveal the television, she flips to a televangelist station.

TELEVANGELIST
Now I know it's hard. It's hard to look up when you're down. It's hard to look up and see the light. But I'm here to tell you folks, the Lord is with you.

GLORIA turns off the television; the lamp to her right begins sputtering and flickering. She looks around, frowning, and stamps out her cigarette. The television suddenly turns on again, and GLORIA gasps in shock.

TELEVANGELIST
You don't have to suffer, you don't have to be lost. The lord is talking to you right now; he's saying, you are my child and you have a purpose! You think God forgot about you? I tell you no! All you got to do is listen! Can't you just hear those angels singing? Isn't it beautiful? It's time. It's time to receive the message he's sending. It's time to listen to the Word of God! Do you hear the glory? I said, can you hear it? I said, can you just hear the glory?

The lamp is still flickering and the entire room begins to shake. GLORIA clutches at the couch, looking around in panic. Behind her, a blinding light glows, and she turns to face it in horror, then awe.

GLORIA (no sound)
Oh my god.

ACT ONE
INT. PSYCH WARD - DAY

GLORIA is seated quietly on her bed in a psych ward. Her hair is straight and her face clean; she's wearing a bathrobe and reading a book held in her left hand. The door opens behind her and she turns.

GLORIA
Good morning. You're not the usual guy.

Pan around to reveal who she's talking to; it's SAM, in white scrubs and holding a clipboard.

SAM
No, uh, just filling in. So how you feeling today, Gloria?

GLORIA
I've never felt better.

SAM
So, no disturbances lately?

GLORIA
You mean am I stark raving cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

SAM
I didn't' say that.

GLORIA
It's all right. I know what people must think.

SAM
What do you think?

GLORIA
I think what I saw was real.



EPISODE TITLE:
HOUSES OF THE HOLY

SAM looks around, pulls up a chair and sets the clipboard down. He leans forward, elbows on knees, and gives her an intensely earnest look.

SAM
I'd like to know what you saw.

GLORIA
It was all over the news. I stabbed a man in the heart.

SAM
Why would you do that?

GLORIA
Because it was God's will.

SAM
Did God talk to you?

GLORIA
No. I get the sense God's a little busy for house calls. No, he, he sent someone.

SAM
Someone?

GLORIA
An angel. It came to me in this beautiful white light, and it filled me with this feeling. It's, it's hard to describe.

SAM
And this angel...

GLORIA
Spoke God's Word.

SAM
And the Word was to kill someone?

GLORIA
I know, it sounds strange. But what I did was very important. I helped him smite an evil man. I was chosen. For redemption.

SAM
This man you stabbed, did the angel give you his name?

GLORIA
No, he just told me to wait for the sign. And the very next day I saw it, right beside the man's doorway. And I knew.

SAM
Why him?

GLORIA
I just know what the angel told me: that this man was guilty to his deepest foundations. And that was good enough for me.



INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

DEAN is lying on the motel bed, which is vibrating, as he listens to music on his phone. He looks sort of blissful. As SAM enters, DEAN doesn't notice him.

SAM
Hey.
(smacking DEAN on the boot)
Hey! (loudly)

DEAN
Hey. Man, you gotta try this. I mean there really is magic in the (air quotes) Magic Fingers.

SAM
Dean, you're enjoying that way too much. It's kind of making me uncomfortable.

DEAN
What am I supposed to do? I mean, you've got me on lockdown here, I'm bored out of my skull.

SAM
Hey, you were the bank robber on the eleven o'clock news, not me. We can't risk you just walking into a government facility.

DEAN
Hmm.

SAM waves a dismissing hand at DEAN as he turns to go into the bathroom. The bed shutters to stillness.

DEAN
Aw, dammit! That was my last quarter. Hey! You got any quarters?

DEAN pulls his headphones out and gets up, crossing the room and leaning on the doorway to the bathroom where SAM is washing his face.

SAM
No!

DEAN
So did you get in to see that crazy hooker?

SAM
Yeah. Gloria Sitnick. And I'm not so sure she's crazy.

DEAN
But she seriously believes that she was ... touched by an angel?

SAM
Yeah. Blinding light, feelings of spiritual ecstasy, the works. I mean, she's living in a locked ward and she's totally at peace.

DEAN
Oh yeah, you're right, sounds completely sane. What about the dude she stabbed?

SAM
Uh, Carl Gully. She said she killed him because he was evil.

DEAN
Was he?

SAM
I don't know. I mean, I couldn't find any dirt on him. I mean, he didn't have a criminal record, he worked at the campus library, had lots of friends. He was a churchgoer.

DEAN
Hm. So then Gloria's just your standard-issue wacko. I mean, (pshew) she wouldn't be the first nutjob in history to kill in the name of religion. Know what I mean?

SAM
No, but she's the second in town to murder because an angel told them to. Little bit odd, don't ya think?

DEAN
Well, little odd yes, supernatural maybe. But angels? I don't think so.

SAM
Why not?

DEAN
(as if it's obvious)
'Cuz there's no such thing, Sam.

SAM
Dean, there's ten times as much lore about angels as there is about anything else we've ever hunted.

DEAN
Yeah, you know what? There's a ton of lore on unicorns too. In fact, I hear that they, they ride on silver moonbeams, and they shoot rainbows out of their ass.

SAM
(sitting down, total deadpan)
Wait, there's no such thing as unicorns?

DEAN
That's cute. I'm just saying, man, there's just some legends that you just, you file under "bullcrap".

SAM
And you've got angels on the bullcrap list.

DEAN
Yep.

SAM
Why?

DEAN (looks up)
Because I've never seen one.

SAM
So what?

DEAN
So I believe in what I can see.

SAM
Dean! You and I have seen things that most people couldn't even dream about.

DEAN
Exactly. With our own eyes. That's hard proof, okay? But in all this time I have never seen anything that looks like an angel. And don't you think that if they existed that we would have crossed paths with them? Or at least know someone that crossed paths with them? No. This is a, a demon or a spirit. You know, they find people a few fries short of a happy meal, and they trick them into killing these randoms.

SAM
Maybe.

DEAN
(rolls his eyes)
Can we just — I'm going stir-crazy man. Hey, let's go by Gloria's apartment, huh?

SAM
I was just there. Nothing. No sulfur, no EMF ...

DEAN
You didn't see any fluffy white wing feathers?

SAM (sighs)
But Gloria did say the angel gave her a sign, right beside Carl Gully's doorway.

DEAN
(eagerly)
Could be something at his house; it's worth checking out.



EXT. GULLY HOUSE - DAY

DEAN is driving as they pull up in front of Carl Gully's house. It is a moderate single-family home with steps leading up to the front door; to the left of the door is a plastic angel figure. DEAN mounts the steps and sees it.

DEAN
Oh hey, Sam. I think I found it. (gesturing to the angel) It's a sign from up above.
(he peers in the window)
Well, I think I learned a valuable lesson: Always take down your Christmas decorations after New Year's, or you might get filleted by a hooker from God. Ha.

SAM
I'm laughing on the inside.

SAM wanders around back, through a gate, and DEAN follows; they find a wooden storm cellar.

SAM
You know, Gloria said the guy was guilty to his deepest foundations.

DEAN
You think she literally meant the foundation?



INT. STORM CELLAR - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN open the creaking door and go down the steps, shining flashlights.

DEAN
Hm.

SAM notices scratches on a wall near the floor; he leans over to get a closer look.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN
You got something?

SAM digs at the wall and pulls something out.

DEAN
What is it?

SAM
It's a fingernail.

They look at each other.

DEAN pulls two shovels from the wall and they begin to dig.

LATER, a deep pit has been completed to reveal a pile of skeletons.

SAM
So much for the innocent churchgoing librarian.

DEAN
Yeah, well, whatever spoke to Gloria about this knew what it was talking about, I'll give you that.



INT. ZACH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A young man (ZACH)is lying on a single bed, staring at the ceiling. He drinks from a bottle of liquor; a comic book entitled "THESEUS" rests open on his chest. The room begins to shake violently, the lights flickering. More bottles tumble to the floor from the night stand, and the television topples with a crash. ZACH scrambles out of bed frantically; a blinding light appears in front of him and he holds up a hand in terror; then awe washes over his features.



EXT. STREET - NIGHT

ZACH walks down the sidewalk calmly, hands in his pockets; he sees the blinding light beside a house and stops. He stares for a long time, then nods and smiles and approaches the house, and knocks on the door. A middle-aged man (FRANK) opens the door.

FRANK
Yes?

ZACH
Hi. My name is Zach.

FRANK
Can I help you?

ZACH pulls out a knife and stabs FRANK through the heart. We pull back to reveal a stone angel to the left of the door - approximately where the blinding light had come from.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

DEAN is sitting on the edge of the bed with a police radio in hand, listening. He looks painfully bored.

WOMAN'S VOICE (POLICE RADIO)
We've got a minor TA, involving a motorcycle and a, uh van, this is at the corner of 28th and Pine, 28th and Pine

As SAM enters, DEAN sighs and looks back sadly at the "Magic Fingers" controller.

DEAN (eagerly, almost desperately, looking back at the Magic Fingers controller)
D'you bring quarters?

SAM frowns at the controller.

SAM
Dude! I'm not enabling your sick habit.
(tossing a sandwich at DEAN)
You're like one of those lab rats that pushes the pleasure button instead of the food button until it dies.

DEAN
What are you talking about? I eat. And I got news.

SAM
Me too.

DEAN
All right, you go first.

SAM
Three students have disappeared off the college campus in the last year. All of them were last seen at the library.

DEAN
Where Carl Gully worked.

SAM
Yep.

DEAN
Sick bastard.

SAM
So Gloria's angel —
DEAN
Angel?

SAM
Okay. Whatever this thing is . . .

DEAN
Okay, well, whatever it is, it's struck again.

SAM
What?

DEAN
I was listening to the police radio before you got here. There was this guy, uh, Zach Smith, some local drunk; he went up to a stranger's front door last night, stabbed him in the heart.

SAM
And then I'm guessing he went to the police and confessed?

DEAN
Yep. Roma Downey made him do it.
(crossing the room to take a Post-it note off the mirror)
Now, I, uh . . . got the victim's address.



EXT. VICTIM'S HOUSE - DAY

SAM and DEAN climb over the fence into the yard and sneak in through the window. SAM sits down at the computer as DEAN searches the house.

SAM, as DEAN walks into the room.
Find anything?

DEAN
Well, Frank liked his catalog shopping, but that's about all I got.

SAM
Not much here. Except he's got this one locked file on his computer, I can't . . . . hold on.
(he presses a few buttons, then grins in triumph)
Not anymore. God.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Well, he's got all these emails. Dozens, to this lady named Jennifer.
(beat)
This lady who's thirteen years old.

DEAN
Oh, I don't want to hear this.

SAM
Looks like they met in a chat room. These emails are pretty personal, Dean. Look at that. Setting up a time and place to meet.

DEAN
Great.

SAM
They were supposed to meet today.

DEAN
Huh. Well, I guess if you're gonna stab someone, good timing. I don't know, man, this is weird, you know? I mean, sure, some spirits are out for vengeance, but this one's almost like a do-gooder, you know? Like, like a --

SAM
Avenging angel?
(DEAN turns away)
Well, how else do you explain it, Dean? Three guys, not connected to each other, all stabbed through the heart? At least two were world-class pervs, and I bet if you dug deep enough on the other guy —

DEAN
(picking something up)
Hey.

SAM
What?

DEAN
You said Carl Gully was a churchgoer, right?

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
What was the name of his church?

SAM
Uh ... Our Lady of the Angels?

DEAN
Of course that'd be the name.
(he holds up a church flier)
Looks like Frank went to the same church.



INT. OUR LADY OF THE ANGELS CHURCH - DAY

DEAN and SAM walk through the sanctuary of the church, speaking to a friendly-looking priest (FATHER REYNOLDS).

FATHER REYNOLDS
So you're interested in joining the parish?

DEAN
Yeah, well, you know, we just don't feel right unless we hit church every Sunday.

FR. REYNOLDS
Where'd you say you lived before?

SAM
Uh ...

DEAN
Fremont, Texas.

SAM
Yeah.

FR. REYNOLDS
Really? That's a nice town. St. Teresa's parish, you must know the priest there.

DEAN
Sure, yeah, no it's uh, Father O'Malley.

FR. REYNOLDS
Hmm, I know a Father Shaughnessy.

DEAN
Shaughnessy, exactly. What'd I say?

SAM (breaking in)
You know, we're just happy to be here now, Father.

FR. REYNOLDS
And we're happy to have you, we could use some young blood around here.

DEAN
Hey, listen, I gotta ask — no offense, but uh, the neighborhood?

FR. REYNOLDS
Well, it's gone to seed a little, there's no denying that, but that's why what the church does here is so important. Like I always say, you can expect a miracle, but in the meantime you work your butt off.

DEAN
Huh. Yeah, we heard about the murders.

FR. REYNOLDS
Yes. The victims were parishioners of mine, I'd known them for years.

SAM
And the killers said that an angel made them do that?

FR. REYNOLDS
Yes. Misguided souls, to think that God's messenger would appear and incite people to murder. It's tragic.

DEAN
So you don't believe in those angel yarns, huh?

FR. REYNOLDS
Oh, no, I absolutely believe. Kind of goes with the job description.

SAM
(nodding to a painting on the wall)
Father, that's Michael, right?

FR. REYNOLDS
That's right. The archangel Michael, with the flaming sword. The fighter of demons. Holy force against evil.

SAM
So they're not really the Hallmark card version that everybody thinks? They're fierce, right? Vigilant?

FR. REYNOLDS
Well, I like to think of them as more loving than wrathful. But, uh, yes, a lot of Scripture paints angels as God's warriors. "An angel of the Lord appeared to them, the glory of the Lord shone down upon them, and they were terrified."
(SAM nods, DEAN looks confused)
Luke. Two nine.


Dean nods sagely.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

SAM
Well, thank you for speaking with us, Father.

FR. REYNOLDS
Oh, it' s my pleasure. Hope to see you again.

DEAN
(seeing a collection of tribute items at the bottom of the steps)
Hey, Father, what's, what is all that for?

FR. REYNOLDS
Oh, that's for Father Gregory. He was a priest here.

DEAN
Was?

FR. REYNOLDS

He passed away right on these steps. He's interred in the church crypt.

DEAN
When did this happen?

FR. REYNOLDS
Two months ago. He was shot for his car keys.

SAM
I'm sorry.

FR. REYNOLDS
Yeah, me too. He was a good friend. I didn't even have time to administer his last rites. But like I said, it's a tough neighborhood. Ever since he died I've been praying my heart out.

SAM
For what?

FR. REYNOLDS
For deliverance. From the violence and the bloodshed around here. We could use a little divine intervention, I s'pose.

DEAN
Well, Padre, thanks. We'll see you again.

FR. REYNOLDS goes back inside; DEAN and SAM investigate the shrine.

DEAN
Well, it's all starting to make sense. Devoted priest dies a violent death? That's vengeful spirit material right there.
(SAM shifts uncomfortably)
And he knew all the other stiffs, because they went to church here, in fact I'm willing to bet that because he was their priest, he knew things about them that nobody else knew.

SAM
Then again, Father Reynolds started praying for God's help about two months ago, right? Right about the time all this started happening?

DEAN
Aw, come on, man, what's your deal?

SAM
What do you mean?

DEAN
Look, I'll admit I'm a bit of a skeptic, but since when are you all Mr., uh, 700 Club? No, seriously. From the git-go you've been willing to buy this angel crap, man. I mean, what's next, are you going to start praying every day?

SAM
I do.

DEAN
What?

SAM
I do pray every day. I have for a long time.

DEAN
(startled)
The things you learn about a guy. Huh. Well, come on, let's go check out Father Gregory's grave.



INT. CHURCH CRYPT - EVENING

The crypt is a maze of stone hallways, with numerous stone angel figurines. They wander through slowly, DEAN a little ahead of SAM. As DEAN goes into another room, SAM stops, looking back at one of the angels. He frowns as it, and then the entire room, begin to shake. A brilliant light appears behind him and he turns, confusion washing away to a look of awe.



END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. CHURCH - EVENING

DEAN hurries back into the room.

DEAN
Sam, come on, get the lead out.

He sees SAM passed out on the floor, and rushes over.

DEAN
Sammy? Sammy! Hey!

SAM jerks awake, groaning.

DEAN
Y'okay?

SAM
(staring at the stone angel, stunned)
Yeah. Yeah. 'm okay.

DEAN
Come on.

He hauls SAM to his feet and guides him into the sanctuary, a hand on his arm, and shuts the door behind them.

DEAN
You saw it, didn't you? Didn't you?

SAM
Yeah. Yeah. Dean, I saw an angel.

DEAN
You...
(SAM sits as DEAN pulls out a flask, unscrews it and hands it to him.)
All right. Here.

SAM
I don't want a drink.

DEAN
(shrugs, takes a swig)
So. What makes you think you saw a, uh, angel?

SAM
It just, it appeared before me and I just, this feeling washed over me, you know? Like, like peace. Like grace.

DEAN
Okay, Ecstasy Boy, maybe we'll get you some glow sticks and a nice Dr. Seuss hat, huh?

SAM
Dean, I'm serious. It spoke to me, it knew who I was.

DEAN
It's just a spirit, Sam. Okay? And it's not the first one to be able to read people's minds.
(he sits down on another pew)
Okay, let me guess. You were personally chosen to smite some sinner. You've just got to wait for some divine bat signal, is that it?

SAM
Yeah, actually.

DEAN
Great. I don't suppose you asked what this alleged bad guy did?

SAM
Actually I did, Dean. And the angel told me. He hasn't done anything. Yet. But he will.

DEAN
(stands and starts pacing)
Oh, this is, this is . . . I don't believe this.

SAM
Dean, the angel hasn't been wrong yet! Someone's going to do something awful, and I can stop it!

DEAN
You know, you're supposed to be bad too, maybe, maybe I should just stop you right now.

SAM
You know what, Dean? I don't understand! Why can't you even consider the possibility?

DEAN
What, that this is an angel?

SAM
Yes! Maybe we're hunting an angel here, and we should stop! Maybe this is God's will!

DEAN
Okay, all right. You know what? I get it. You've got faith. That's — hey, good for you. I'm sure it makes things easier.
(he sits again)
I'll tell you who else had faith like that — Mom. She used to tell me when she tucked me in that angels were watching over us. In fact, that was the last thing she ever said to me.

SAM
You never told me that.

DEAN
Well, what's to tell? She was wrong. There was nothing protecting her. There's no higher power, there's no God. I mean, there's just chaos, and violence, and random unpredictable evil th, that comes out of nowhere, and rips you to shreds. You want me to believe in this stuff? I'm going to need to see some hard proof. You got any?
(beat)
Well, I do. Proof that we're dealing with a spirit.



INT. CRYPT - EVENING

Father Gregory's tombstone is covered in creeping vines; DEAN and SAM crouch before it.

SAM
That looks like—

DEAN
It's wormwood. Plant associated with the dead; specifically the ones that are not at rest. I don't see it growing anywhere else, except over the murdered priest's marker. It's him, Sam.

SAM
Maybe.

DEAN
Maybe?

SAM
Dean, I don't know what to think.

DEAN
Okay. You want some more proof? I'll give you more proof.

SAM
How?

DEAN
We'll summon Gregory's spirit.

SAM
What? Here? In the church?

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, we just need a few odds and ends, and that, uh, séance ritual in Dad's journal.

SAM
Oh, a séance, great. Hope Whoopi's available.

DEAN
(deadpan)
That's funny, actually. Seriously. If Father Gregory's spirit is around, a séance will bring him right to us. If it's him, then we'll put him to rest.

SAM
But if it's an angel, it won't show. Nothin' 'll happen.

DEAN
Exactly. That's one of the perks of the job, Sam: we don't have to operate on faith. We can know for sure. Don't you wanna know for sure?



EXT. STREET - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM leave a small grocery store, SAM holding a paper sack and smiling.

SAM
Dude. I'll admit we've gone pretty ghetto with spellwork before, but this takes the cake. I mean, a Spongebob placemat instead of an altar cloth?

DEAN
We'll just put it Spongebob side down.
SAM laughs, then stops in shock, staring at something across the street: a young man holding a bunch of flowers; a bright white light glows behind him.

SAM
Dean, that's it.

DEAN
What?

SAM
That's the sign!

DEAN
Where?

SAM
Right there, right behind that guy! That's him, Dean. And we have to stop him.



END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The young man crosses the street; SAM starts to go after him but DEAN stops him.

DEAN
Wait a minute.

SAM
What are you doing? Let me go.

DEAN
You're not going to go kill somebody because a ghost told you to, are you insane?

SAM
Dean, I'm not insane, I'm not going to kill him. I'm going to stop him.

DEAN
Define "stop", huh? I mean, what are you going to do?

SAM
Dean, please, he's going to hurt someone, you know it.

DEAN
All right, come on.

The young man has gotten into a car and starts it up, pulling away. DEAN gets in the driver side of his car and starts it; SAM tries to get in the other side but the door is locked.

SAM
Dean. Unlock my door.

DEAN
You're not killing anyone, Sam. I got this guy, you go do the séance.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN pulls away, following the young man at a short distance. The man stops at a corner and gets out with the bunch of flowers, handing them to a woman waiting on the corner. They both get in the car and drive off again.



INT. CHURCH CRYPT - NIGHT

Kneeling before Gregory's grave, SAM has the spell materials spread out: a circle of small white candles, a large black candle in the middle, the placemat (Spongebob side down), and the Journal. He lights the candles, picks up John's Journal, and reads.

(transcriber's note: I have no confidence in the Latin here, any assistance is appreciated.)

SAM
Amate spiritus obscure
te quaerimus, te oramus
nobiscum colloquere
aput nos circita

(loose translation: the Inquisiton, 10/31/08)

Beloved hidden spirit
We seek you, we beg you
Come speak with us
Join our circle

He sprinkles some herb on the black candle and it flares once, brightly.

FR. REYNOLDS
(entering)
What are you doing? What is this?

SAM
Uh, Father, please. I can explain. Um . . . actually, maybe i can't. Um. This is a, a séance.

FR. REYNOLDS
A séance? Young man, you are in the House of God.

SAM
It's based on early Christian rites, if that helps any.

FR. REYNOLDS
Enough. You're coming with me.

SAM
Father, please, you, just wait a second!

As FR. REYNOLDS pulls SAM to the exit, a familiar bright glow builds behind them. They turn, FR. REYNOLDS in awe, SAM in disappointment.

FR. REYNOLDS
Oh my god! Is that ... is that an angel?

SAM
No, it's not. It's just Father Gregory.

The bright glow dims and coalesces to reveal a young, handsome priest (FR. GREGORY).

FR. REYNOLDS
Thomas?!

FR. GREGORY
I've come in answer to your prayers.



EXT. STREET - NIGHT

DEAN continues to follow the supposedly evil young man.



INT. CHURCH CRYPT - NIGHT

SAM approaches the Gregory-spirit cautiously.

FR. GREGORY
Sam. I thought I sent you on your path. You should hurry.

SAM
Father, I'm sorry. But you're not an angel.

FR. GREGORY
Of course I am.

SAM
No. You're a man. You're a spirit. And you need to rest.

FR. GREGORY
I was a man. But now I'm an angel. I was on the steps of the church. And I felt that bullet pierce right through me. But there was no pain. And suddenly I could see . . .everything. Father Reynolds, I saw you, praying and crying here. I came to help you.

FR. REYNOLDS
Help me how?



EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The allegedly evil young man turns down a dark alley and DEAN temporarily loses sight of him. He slams the steering wheel in frustration.

DEAN
Dammit!



INT. CHURCH CRYPT - NIGHT

FR. REYNOLDS
Those murders — that was because of you?

FR. GREGORY
I received the Word of God. He spoke to me, told me to smite the wicked. I'm carrying out his will.

FR. REYNOLDS
You're driving innocent people to kill.

FR. GREGORY
Those innocent people are being offered redemption. Some people need redemption. Don't they, Sam?

Sam looks away, touched a nerve.

FR. REYNOLDS
How can you call this redemption?

FR. GREGORY
You can't understand it now. But the rules of man and the rules of God are two very different things.

SAM
Those people. They're locked up.

FR. GREGORY
No, they're happy. They've found peace, beaten their demons. And I've given them the keys to Heaven.

FR. REYNOLDS
No. No, this is vengeance, it's wrong. Thomas, this goes against everything you believed. You're lost, misguided.

FR. GREGORY
Father. No, I'm not misguided.

FR. REYNOLDS
You are not an angel, Thomas. Men cannot be angels.

FR. GREGORY
But . . . but I, I don't understand. You prayed for me to come.

FR. REYNOLDS
I prayed for God's help. Not this. What you're doing is not God's will. "Thou shalt not kill". That's the word of God.



EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

The supposedly evil young man stops the car; the young woman holding the flowers looks confused, smiles nervously.

YOUNG WOMAN
How come we stopped?

The supposedly evil young man smiles back more nervously, his eye twitching. He leans over suddenly and kisses her. She fends him off with a laugh.

YOUNG WOMAN
Um, weren't we going to go to the movies? Ah -- We should go, or we're going to be late.

Suddenly the supposedly evil young man hits her, hard, across the face. She yelps in shock.

SUPPOSEDLY EVIL YOUNG MAN
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's just I've never done this before.

She tries to get out of the car, but he's locked the door and she scrabbles uselessly at the handle.

EVIL YOUNG MAN
Look, I said I was sorry!

YOUNG WOMAN
Please!
(he pulls out a knife)
What?

He lunges at her with the knife; she tries to fight him off. They struggle for a few seconds.

EVIL YOUNG MAN
No. N-- Stop it!

The window shatters behind his head; DEAN reaches in, punches in, and slams his face into the steering wheel. DEAN unlocks the doors and the woman gets out; he tumbles over the hood to reach her, grabbing her shoulders frantically.

DEAN
Are you okay? Are you okay?!

YOUNG WOMAN
(crying)
Thank god!

Behind them, the evil young man has come to and started the car; he drives off.

DEAN
Dammit! Are you sure you're okay? Do you have a cell phone?
(she nods, still sobbing)
Call 9-1-1!

DEAN runs off and gets in his car to chase after the evil young man again.



INT. CHURCH CRYPT - NIGHT

FR. GREGORY is staring, bewildered, at his own headstone. He turns to face REYNOLDS and SAM.

SAM
Let us help you.

FR. GREGORY
No.

FR. REYNOLDS
It's time to rest, Thomas, to be at peace. Please, let me give you Last Rites.

FR. GREGORY nods in resignation; FR. REYNOLDS lifts his hands in prayer.

FR. REYNOLDS
Oh Holy Hosts above, I call upon thee as a servant of Christ to sanctify our actions this day, in fulfillment of the will of God.

REYNOLDS gasps as GREGORY flickers like a distorted image.

FR. GREGORY
Father Reynolds?

FR. REYNOLDS
Rest.

GREGORY kneels; REYNOLDS holds a hand over GREGORY'S forehead

FR. REYNOLDS
I call upon the Archangel Raphael, Master of the Air, to make open the way. Let the fire of the Holy Spirit now descend, that this being might be awakened to the world beyond.

FR. GREGORY glows brightly, then vanishes to a short soft (angelic) chorus. REYNOLDS lowers his hand in awe.



EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Car chase scene. Chasing the evil young man at a more frantic rate now, DEAN grips the steering wheel tightly. They cut across lanes, over grass, and generally cause mayhem; at a cross-street, a small pickup truck carrying long metal pipes screeches to a halt in front of the man's car. A pipe spins off the truck bed, bouncing once on the ground and plowing straight through his windshield. It impales him straight through the chest. DEAN stops the car in shock and gets out.

DEAN
Holy . . .



END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM is packing. DEAN approaches the room and enters from outside.
How was your day?

SAM (sadly, dully, demoralized)
You were right. It wasn't an angel. It was Gregory.

DEAN pulls the flask from his inner pocket, takes a drink, then, considering, offers it to SAM. SAM takes it.

Note: Over the following conversation, Bob Dylan's "Knocking on Heaven's Door" plays.

SAM
I don't know, Dean, I just, uh . . .
(he sits on the bed)
I wanted to believe ... so badly, ah ... It's so damn hard to do this, what we do. You're all alone, you know? And ... there's so much evil out there in the world, Dean, I feel like I could drown in it. And when I think about my destiny, when I think about how I could end up...

DEAN
(sitting on the bed beside him)
Yeah, well, don't worry about that. All right? I'm watching out for you.

SAM
Yeah, I know you are. But you're just one person, Dean. And I needed to think that there was something else, watching too, you know? Some higher power. Some greater good. And that maybe . . .

(Eric Clapton's "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" slowly enters)

DEAN
Maybe what?

SAM
Maybe I could be saved.
(nervous laugh)
But, uh, you know, that just clouded my judgment, and you're right. I mean, we've gotta go with what we know, with what we can see, with what's right there in front of our own two eyes.

DEAN
Yeah, well, it's funny you say that.

SAM
Why?

DEAN
Gregory's spirit gave you some pretty good information. That guy in the car was bad news. I barely got there in time.

SAM
What happened?

DEAN
He's dead.

SAM
Did . . . you?

DEAN
No. But I'll tell you one thing. If . . . The way he died, if I hadn't seen it with my own two eyes I never would have believed it. I mean ... I don't know what to call it.

SAM
What? Dean, what did you see?

DEAN
Maybe . . . God's will.
