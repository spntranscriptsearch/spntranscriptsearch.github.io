Teaser:
[Exterior convenience store, night]
[Open to booted feet walking on asphalt. Location: I-135 just north of Wichita, Kansas. Younger man, wearing a pony tail and parka, enters convenience store]
DALE: Hey Marty. How’s your night?
[Marty rolls his eyes and continues to read a magazine. While checking over the selection of alcohol, the young man notices two pretty, blond young ladies in the next aisle giggling. He goes to greet the girls]
JAMIE: Hi! [playfully]
DALE: Hey!
[The younger one slides past him dropping a hex bag into his pocket as she passes]
JENNIE: Excuse me.
JAMIE: [quietly] Aegrota amore.
[Smooth jazz music begins to play in the background. The man turns with a smile spreading across his face and we see a reflection of pink/purple light in his eyes. Jamie approaches seductively]
JAMIE: Oh my God! Hi! I was totally hoping we could talk.
DALE: You and to talk to me?
JAMIE: Mm-hmm. I mean you’re so handsome.
DALE: [Surprised] Really?
JAMIE: What’s your name?
DALE: Dale.
JAMIE: I’m Jamie, and that’s my sister Jennie.
[Dale turns and gives a nod to Jennie standing down the aisle]
DALE: Y’all from around here?
JAMIE: Nah, my sister and I are on our way to this little town called Lebanon. Heard of it?
DALE: I can’t say that I have. [begins to chuckle] You are so beautiful.
JAMIE: Oh. Thank you. Anyway, we’re out of gas and we’re out of money. Tragic, right?
DALE: That is terrible. [concerned] Well, what can I do for ya? I’ll do anything.
JAMIE: I knew you were our hero. The easiest thing would be to take all the money from the register, grab a couple bottles of good vodka, and bring it outside.
DALE: What about Marty?
JAMIE: What about him?
[Jazz begins to play again and Jamie kisses Dale on the cheek. Dale’s face lights up with a huge smile and we hear tinkling in the background]
[Glass shatters as we see Marty coming through the store window, groaning in pain. Dale exits with bag in one hand and a fist full of money in the other. He triumphantly heads towards the girls waiting in the parking lot]
JENNIE: Finally.
DALE: Got it for you, baby. [confused] What’s with the hammer?
JAMIE: Oh, my God, sexy. It’s just for in case. Like for protection. This is a dangerous place at night.
JENNIE: I mean, that guy in there totally just got killed.
DALE: Oh, don’t worry. I won’t let anything bad happen to you. I love you.
JAMIE: Oh, I love you too. Uh, what was your name again?
DALE: Dale.
JAMIE: Right. Yes. But don’t worry, Dale. Our mom taught us three really important steps to looking out for ourselves.
JENNIE: Always look your best, never get attached to a man.
JAMIE: And always make the death look non-magical. So you don’t attract hunters.
DALE: The death?
[Jamie hits Dale in the gut with the handle of a large sledge hammer. Dale groans and drops to the ground]
JAMIE: Now be a good boy and hold really still for me.
[Jamie swings the sledge hammer and we hear the squishing sound of Dale’s head as he lets out another groan. Jamie, spattered with blood, drops the bloody hammer head on the asphalt]
JAMIE: How’d we do?
JENNIE: [laughing and fanning the money] So good.
[We see the bloody hammer head being drug away on the asphalt]
Title Sequence Season 13

Act I: Interior MoL bunker
DEAN: Alright! We’ve got “Principia Phantasmagoria.” [throws each large book onto a pile of books in front of Sam] We have “Archive of the Unnatural Occurrences.” And we’ve got “Jower et Nuet.” Kind of a weird name.
SAM: “Jour et Nuit.” It’s, uh, it’s French. It means “The Book of Day and Night.”
DEAN: Fancy. So, this is everything that even mentions some alternate realities. So there’s gotta be something here that talks about the Apocalypse World, right?
SAM: Yeah, maybe.
DEAN: [Frustrated] Dude.
SAM: I’m just saying, Dean, Jack was our way over there, obviously, so with him gone…
DEAN: Okay, well, Jack’s been gone before. We found him once. We can find him again.
SAM: No, no, he didn’t run away. He is literally in an alternate reality.
DEAN: Okay, so we’ll just come up with a plan B, okay? You said it yourself. We just keep our heads down and we’ll do the work.
SAM: You said that.
DEAN: And I was right. Yeah. So you read, do your Sam thing, I’m gonna go for a beer run.
SAM: Yeah.
DEAN: We should probably loop Cas in at some point.
SAM: We’ll fill him in when he calls. He checks in every day.
DEAN: Yeah, with a bunch of questions and no leads.
[We see Castiel sitting in a dark prison cell in hell, illuminated by a single unseen overhead light]
SAM: I’m sure he is doing the best he can. Just go get beer or… [waves Dean away]
[Dean taps the pile of books as he leaves as if to remind Sam to get busy as well]

[We return to Castiel in the cell waiting/contemplating. A demon walks by to check the prisoners. We see Lucifer unsuccessfully trying to reach a stick in his cell with his powers]
Demon: [mockingly] Huh, I always thought you’d have a bigger stick.
LUCIFER: What’s your name again?
Demon: They call me Dipper.
LUCIFER: [laughing] And you let them? Listen, Dipper, it’s not the size of the stick, it’s how you use it.
Demon: Funniest thing, I’m always hearing that from guys with… little sticks.
[Lucifer laughs sarcastically and grabs the cell bars. He is hit with an electrical shock and lets go with a painful grunt]
Demon: Smooth. [smugly] We gave the warding a little kick. Just for you.
[Demon exits prison area]
LUCIFER: Thanks. So considerate. Appreciate that a lot. [yelling at departing demon] You’re not nice, and I don’t like you. You’re treating me like an everyday angel! And if I had just a little more power, I could tear this place apart! Just sayin’.
[Lucifer tests the bars again and receives another powerful shock]
CASTIEL: You don’t have that power, and they know it.
LUCIFER: Okay, well if somebody would be a pal and let me eat a little of his grace, I would have enough strength to get out of here and butcher that son of a bitch! [yelling into the distance]
CASTIEL: Well, that’s a nice, horrifying plan. Little cannibalism.
LUCIFER: Really? I seem to remember a somebody snacking on angel grace once upon a time. There is no “I” in “team,” Castiel. I want you to remember that. Fine, whatever. I can wait. Asmodeus was my weakest creation.
CASTIEL: Oh, he was, was he? Doesn’t seem that weak to me.
LUCIFER: [pacing his cell] Yeah, yeah, that – that whole shape-shifty thing he does? I – I didn’t give him that. But so what? The old dog’s learned some new tricks. Eventually he is going to mess up. Then he’s mine. Okay?
CASTIEL: Excuses aside, you’re saying you’re too weak to overcome even your weakest creation.
LUCIFER: [dismissively] Shut up.
[We see Cas’s face break into a triumphant smile]

[Exterior, day, outside convenience store. Dean rounds the corner to where Baby is parked, 6-pack of beer in hand]
JENNIE: Somebody help! Please, there’s something wrong with my sister!
[Dean places beer on Baby’s hood and runs over to the two young blond girls to help]
JENNIE: [frantically] Please, please. Please!
DEAN: Okay. Watch out, watch out, watch out. What happened?
[Dean kneels over the girl, laying on the ground]
JENNIE: I don’t know. Please. She just – she just collapsed. I – We were walking and… [quietly] Aegrota amore.
[Jennie slips a hex bag into Dean’s coat pocket. Smooth, romantic jazz begins to play again and we hear tinkling in the background. As Dean looks up we see the flash of pink/purple light in his eyes]
JENNIE: Doesn’t a kiss, like, usually wake up your true love?
[Dean blinks as if to clear his head. He looks down and slowly moves to place a gentle kiss on Jamie’s lips. Jamie gasps and slowly opens her eyes]
JAMIE: Thank you. [Dean helps her sit up] You saved me. Are you Dean Winchester?
DEAN: I – I…Yeah. How are you feeling?
JAMIE: How are you feeling?
DEAN: Good. Real good.
[Jamie and Jennie smile slyly to each other as the jazz music continues to play]

[Interior MoL bunker library later that same day. Dean enters whistling]
SAM: Hey, uh… I think you might be right. I think maybe it’s time we go ahead and call Cas, because, I mean, if…if…
[Dean continues to whistle while doing a little spin as he enters the library. He drops the 6-pack and his keys on the table]
SAM: You all right?
DEAN: Am I all right? I’m in love.
SAM: You...Oh, are you?
DEAN: I mean, I am, like, full-on twitterpated here. Seriously, I can’t wait for you to meet her, either. She – I mean, she’s… She’s sweet and she’s beautiful and she’s just kinda sorta perfect. Anyway, I’m thinking of asking her to move in with me here…if that’s cool ‘cause this is big time.
[Dean opens a drawer and removes the Black Grimoire and unwraps it]
DEAN: Ahh.
SAM: Uh, Dean, w-what are you doing with the Black Grimoire?
DEAN: It’s a gift. For Jamie.
SAM: For…Jamie?
DEAN: My soul mate. [winking]
SAM: Sure. Right. And did she happen to ask for that book by, uh, name?
DEAN: Yeah! I mean, isn’t that kind of cosmic fate, that we actually have it? Like… [imitates head explosion]
SAM: “Cosmic fate.” Right, yeah. Okay, okay, okay. I think I know what’s going on here. Do you remember, uh, uh, Becky in Vegas? The love spell.
DEAN: No
SAM: Okay, [stammering] I think Jamie must be a witch or demon…
DEAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
SAM: What?
DEAN: Be nice. ‘Cause she’s got a sister. [smiling widely] And if you play your cards right, you know, you guys might fall for each other. You know, the less attractive siblings, they fall in love. That’s kind of cute, right? Huh?
SAM: Just hold on a second.
DEAN: I can’t wait ‘cause she’s waiting for me at the market, so I’m just gonna…
[Sam quickly grabs Dean’s keys off the table]
DEAN: Okay. All right. That’s fine. You know why? I’ll walk ‘cause it is… [singingly] gorgeous outside.
SAM: Wait a second. Dean, listen, honestly –
[Sam grabs Dean’s shoulder. Dean turns quickly and punches Sam, knocking him out cold]
DEAN: Oooh. Right on the button. Listen, when I get back from my date, I’m going to help you ice that, okay? [heads up spiral staircase] All right, thanks. Good talk, pal! Good talk!

[The two girls are waiting outside the market]
JAMIE: You gonna make that call after we get the book?
JENNIE: No. We’re fully, like, making an audible.
[Both girls laugh. We seen Dean with the book, arrive in the background]
JENNIE: Where’s the car? [with clenched teeth] I wanted the car.
DEAN: There you go. [hands Jennie the book]
JAMIE: Good boys get a kiss. Close your eyes.
[We hear the scraping of metal on pavement and see Jamie start to swing the large sledge hammer. Just then, Baby races into the parking lot with screeching wheels. Sam hops out and runs towards the group, pointing his gun at Jamie]
SAM: Get away from him. You heard me.
DEAN: [angrily] Don’t point a gun at her! Hey!
SAM: Uhh! No, Dean!
[Dean violently attacks Sam, knocking the gun out of his hands. He slams Sam onto the hood of Baby]
DEAN: Don’t you point a gun at her!
SAM: What are you doing?!
DEAN: Don’t point a gun at her!
SAM: Where is it?
DEAN: You’re jealous! [continuing to wrestle with each other while the girls laugh]
SAM: There’s gotta be a hex bag. Where is it? Please, just….
JENNIE: We should get out of here, in case the one with the hair actually wins.
DEAN: No, no, no, don’t – don’t leave.
JAMIE: Bye boys.
SAM: Where is it? Huh?
[We hear the girls’ car start while Sam continues to wrestle Dean in search of the hex bag. Sam finally finds it and pulls it out of Dean’s pocket. The boys continue to wrestle on the ground]
SAM: Look, Dean! I got it! Hex bag! Wait, Dean – [Dean slaps the hex bag out of Sam’s hand] Aah! No!
DEAN: I’m sorry Sam. I just – I love her so much.
[The boys are zapped with a purple bolt of lightning and break apart, gasping and confused. We hear the clacking of high heels on the pavement. The hex bag bursts into flames. The boys look up to see Rowena]
ROWENA: Hello, boys.

ACT II:
[Inside the prison cells in Hell. We see Lucifer focusing on moving the stick in his cell]
LUCIFER: Rise. Rise. Rise. Rise.
[Foots steps approach and the demon Dipper walks by. Lucifer pauses briefly to hide his actions and gives a cursory nod to the demon. The demon stops in front of Castiel’s cell]
Demon: Don’t think we forgot about you. When the boss gets back, big plans for you.
[Castiel sits silently, motionless. From the next cell we hear…]
LUCIFER: Oh, does he have big plans? Hey, what’s that gonna be worth when Michael get here and, oh, yeah, murders us all?
CASTIEL: Right, if he gets here.
LUCIFER: There’s no “if” here in this equation, okay? Let me – let me just – let me just tell you something about my dick brother, about every version of my dick brother, okay? When he decides to do something, he does it. Doesn’t matter what the cost or who has to die. It’s gonna happen, ‘cause that’s just the way he rolls.
CASTIEL: If you’re right, how much time do we have?
LUCIFER: How much time? Oh. I guess that depends on how much time he spends torturing Mary Winchester. He liked her, right? Oh, Cas, you should have seen it. I mean, the things he did to her. In all my time in hell, I’ve never seen anything that horrible. Just…Oh!
CASTIEL: Stop. I don’t want to hear any more of your lies.
LUCIFER: Oh, this from the angel who almost has me beat in that department, and that’s saying a lot, pal.
CASTIEL: Well, you always say a lot.
LUCIFER: Okay, let’s face it, Cassandra, the truths I say hurts ‘cause the’re hard to swallow, so people call them lies. Go figure.
CASTIEL: You want truth? How ‘bout I tell you a few truths about your son?
LUCIFER: Did you just have an angel stroke?
CASTIEL: Did you know that he loves movies? Fantasy movies, movies with heroes who crush villains.
LUCIFER: [scoffs] Well, that’s – that’s – that’s nurture. That’s not nature.
CASTIEL: And he’s thoughtful. He’s emotional. Remarkably intuitive. You – you know, he, uh, he resurrected me just out of instinct. Isn’t that a beautiful gesture?
LUCIFER: [pacing angrily in his cell] Yeah, that’s, uh, that’s beautiful.
CASTIEL: Jack would rather kill you than hug you. Seems relevant. Did you know he doesn’t – he doesn’t even really look like you? And he reminds me so much of his mother.
LUCIFER: [whispers] Wow.
[Lucifer exhales sharply and swings his arm, causing the stick to fly across the cell, hit the wall and fall to the floor. Lucifer smiles smugly]

[Interior MoL bunker, library. We see Rowena pouring three whiskeys, neat]
ROWENA: Ask me.
DEAN: How are you alive?
SAM: Lucifer told us he killed you pretty, uh… pretty graphically.
ROWENA: And he did. But I take precautions to ensure that if I die it is temporary. [she hands the boys each a whiskey]
SAM: You’re talking about a, uh, resurrection spell, like last time?
ROWENA: [sing-song] Mm, mm. That said, it took a very long time to heal. And I’m not interested in it ever happening again, which is why I need the Black Grimoire.
DEAN: What a coincidence. You happen to show up right when it’s stolen.
ROWENA: Oh, no coincidence. I felt the book moving. In a moment of weakness, I may have put a tracking spell on the Grimoire behind your backs.
DEAN: Moment of weakness, huh? Right.
SAM: Why do you want it so bad? Why now?
ROWENA: Oh, years ago, the Grand Coven cast a binding spell limiting aspects of my magic. There’s a page in the Grimoire that may help.
DEAN: Help you become more powerful? Yeah, that’s what we want.
ROWENA: Help me protect myself.
SAM: Let me get this straight. You, uh, felt the book moving and you decided, what? You’d – you’d – you’d just show up and take it?
ROWENA: Well, I thought about asking you nicely for it, but…
DEAN: Yeah, but you knew we’d tell you to go to Hell.
ROWENA: Exactly. Now, I’m – I’m worried the girls will damage the book, and you’re worried about the awful things they’ll do with it, so… Let’s… help each other, shall we?
SAM: We don’t need your help. We’ve handled witches before.
DEAN: You’re familiar with our work, right?
ROWENA: Ah. Oh, you Winchesters. I’ve changed. [Dean and Sam looks at her skeptically] Honestly. Having your skull crushed and being burned alive can do that to a girl. And It’s my tracking spell, so if you want to find those girls… [teasingly] Well, lover?
DEAN: [having enough of her] Okay.
ROWENA: You’ll need me. Sláinte. [drinks whiskey] Oh. One more thing. Where’s my son?
[Sam and Dean look at each other uncomfortably]

[Daylight. Interior hardware store. Muzak playing in the background]
JENNIE: There are whole parts of this I can’t really read.
[The girls are wandering around the store with the Black Grimoire open]
JAMIE: Because it’s too complicated?
JENNIE: No. Because it’s ultra…old. I mean, some of these symbols are things Mom never even mentioned.
JAMIE: Um, so we wing it. We’re really good at improvising. And you’ve totally got the skills.
JENNIE: Aw. Thanks.
[The girls reach the checkout with their basket of stuff]
Cashier: [a little sassy] Now, you girls are gonna pay for that stuff, right?
JAMIE: Wow. Thanks for the reminder of how shopping works.
Cashier: Well, because last time you just…
JENNIE: [interrupting] Oh, my God. Shut up, Brenda. [The girls walk past the cashier]
JAMIE: Like, please, shut up.
JENNIE: She is so rude. [continues shopping] Huh.
JAMIE: What?
JENNIE: I’m pretty sure this says we need a soul to sacrifice.
JAMIE: Okay. [looking around the two spot a young stock boy]

[Interior MoL library]
ROWENA: Fergus is dead?
SAM: Yep.
DEAN: Killed himself for us.
ROWENA: That doesn’t sound like him.
SAM: Right, well, Fergus, uh, uh… Crowley, um, he had changed a lot. You’d have been proud of him.
ROWENA: Is that so? [emotionally] Fergus was my only child. And I promise you, I’d much rather have a living son, even one that hated me, than a dead hero.
SAM: Because of him Lucifer is trapped in another reality. So…
DEAN: Yeah, the Devil’s gone.
ROWENA: Oh, don’t be stupid. He’s never gone!
SAM: Okay, listen, I know what Lucifer is cap–
ROWENA: [interrupting] Oh, can we not? It’s like reminiscing about an abusive relationship. Why do that?
DEAN: Let’s get back to the book. What kind of hurt can these chicks do with it?
ROWENA: Oh, I’m sure they have big plans.
SAM: Sounds like you know ‘em.
ROWENA: Just remember being a young, overly ambitious, wee witch. And I have to give them some credit. Outfoxed you, didn’t they? [chuckling to Dean] Tell me, did they get to fifth base?
DEAN: There’s no such thing as fifth base.
ROWENA: Oh, you poor, sheltered boy. [Dean gives Sam a confused look] Anyway. What’s by is by. And who knows? If I help you, maybe you’ll change your minds about helping me.
DEAN: No.
SAM: Not happening.

[We see the girls with the Grimoire open, candles lit around a table and a woman with severe wounds on her face lying on it]
JENNIE: Maybe we were too optimistic.
JAMIE: Don’t bail out now, Jennie.
JENNIE: I’m not. But if this goes wrong, who knows what could happen?
JAMIE: [Sighing] Ugh. If you, like, really don’t think we can do this, then it’s time to make a phone call.
JENNIE: No. I’m not asking for help.
[Jamie grabs a family photo off a shelf and shows it to Jennie]
JAMIE: We’re doing this for Mom. She taught us everything, sacrificed so much for us. She sacrificed so many people for us. She was an amazing witch, and she deserves to be alive and gorgeous and with us. And with this book, we can absolutely bring her back.
JENNIE: I know. Just…just don’t yell at me.
JAMIE: [comfortingly] Listen. I’m sorry. I know I’m the big sister and I’m supposed to be the strong one or whatever, but…
JENNIE: [teary-eyed] Yeah?
JAMIE: I just…really miss her.
JENNIE: I do, too.
JAMIE: I know. And, I, like, really believe in us.
JENNIE: Jamie, I… I just want her back so bad.
JAMIE: And we’re going to get her back, even if we have to cast every spell in this book, and crush the skulls of, like, a million people to make it happen.
JENNIE: Okay.
JAMIE: Yes?
JENNIE: Yeah.
Stock boy: [from somewhere in the room] I believe in you, too, Jennie, because I love you.
[We see the stock boy sitting in a plastic-covered chair holding a bouquet of flowers]
JENNIE: Aw. That’s so great.
[Jennie puts down the Grimoire, picks up one of several large knives, and walks over to the stock boy]
JENNIE: Still need that soul, right?
JAMIE: For sure.
JENNIE: Cool.
[Jennie stabs the stock boy and we see him sitting with a pained smile on his face while he dies]

ACT III
[Daylight, outside in small town USA. Baby drives up with Dean, Sam, and Rowena]
SAM: Welcome to Stillwater, Oklahoma.
ROWENA: How depressingly Midwestern.
DEAN: [shutting off Baby’s engine] All right, Red. Where to?
ROWENA: The tracking spell isn’t like GPS. The book is not moving and it’s in this general area. [with a bit of distaste] We’ll need to speak to the yokels.
DEAN: Okay, well, small-town folks usually like to look out for themselves.
ROWENA: I can make them talk.
SAM: Uh, your spells tend to boil people’s brains. So maybe let us handle it.
ROWENA: [resigning] Fine, fine, we can do your very time-consuming investi…[starts snoring and pretends to fall asleep]
DEAN: Okay, see, “we” aren’t doing anything.
SAM: I’ll keep an eye on her.
DEAN: Great.
ROWENA: Leave me with the babysitter if you must, but do start with the women.
[Dean turns and give Rowena a questioning look]
ROWENA: Something tells me those girls aren’t popular with other ladies.

[Interior of Hell’s prison. We see the demon, Dipper, walking down the corridor]
CASTIEL: [from off camera] Face it. You are useless and impotent and unnecessary, and you will die alone, unmourned.
[The demon stops in front of Castiel’s cell]
Demon: You talking to me, pretty boy?
LUCIFER: [from the adjacent cell] No, he’s talking to me. Yeah.
Demon: Yeah. Well, he does have a point. [mockingly] Aw, did you lose your little stick?
LUCIFER: [child-like] I did.
[Lucifer uses his new-found power to pin the demon to the outside of the cell. The electricity from the bars crackles as Lucifer grabs the demon by the throat]
Demon: How did you…
LUCIFER: Turns out rage is a good motivator. [Demon cries out in pain] And I think you forgot something. I’m Lucifer.
[Lucifer stabs the demon in the neck with the stick] Told you size didn’t matter.
Demon: [The demon takes a step back, holding his bleeding neck] You…
LUCIFER: [swinging the cell door open] Whoops. [Demon turns to run only to face Castiel outside his cell]
CASTIEL: Someone got mad and broke his warding. [Castiel smites the demon]
[Lucifer and Castiel make for the exit armed with an angel blade. Two demons show up behind them, quickly joined by two more]
LUCIFER: [raising the angel blade] Good times.

[Daytime, interior of Baby parked in Stillwater, Oklahoma]
ROWENA: Well, this is boring. Is there… I don’t know, music?
SAM: Yeah, yeah. Dean has a tape of Led Zeppelin’s “Moby Dick” with an 8-minute drum solo. [Sam reached into the glove box] Let me see. It’s around here somewhere.
ROWENA: Are you very sure I can’t just enslave some townsfolk and make them take us to the girls?
SAM: I’m very sure you can, but I’m also very sure you shouldn’t.
ROWENA: Bless your precious heart, you just described my entire life.
SAM: [turning to face Rowena in the back seat] Rowena, even if you pull off whatever plan you’re trying to pull off, and even if you manage to get the book back –
ROWENA: [interrupting] I’ve been on my best behavior.
SAM: [nods in acknowledgement] Okay, sure. Let’s say you get the book. It’s not going to change anything. You’re still going to feel helpless. What Lucifer did to you–
ROWENA: [interrupting] Told you, I don’t… [puts on a brave, solemn face] Before he crushed my skull, Lucifer showed me his face. His true face. [brave façade cracks] I’m scared, Sam. All the time.
SAM: I’ve seen it too. What he really looks like behind – behind whatever vessel. It… Yeah, still keeps me up at night.
ROWENA: How do you deal with it?
SAM: I guess I don’t deal with it. Not really. I mean, I pushed it down and, um, the world kept almost ending, so I keep pushing it down, and I don’t know. [stammering] I really don’t talk about it, not even with Dean. I mean, I could. You know, he’d listen, but… That’s not something I really know how to share.

[Daylight. Interior hardware store. Muzak laying as Dean enters. He approaches the Cashier, Brenda]
DEAN: Hi there. Been to a few other places, haven’t had much luck. Was hoping you could help me out.
Cashier: [cheerfully] Oh, happy to try. What do you need?
DEAN: I’m looking for these two girls, uh, in town, Jennie and Jamie.
Cashier: [disgusted] Oh. The Plum sisters.
DEAN: Right. Yeah, I’m looking to track them down.
Cashier: Hmm. You and every other man west of the Ozarks.
DEAN: Popular, huh?
Cashier: That’s one word for it. And a whole mess of trouble.
DEAN: Well, they took something, and I need to get it back.
Cashier: Heard it before, they stole your heart, you can’t live without them.
DEAN: They stole a book.
Cashier: A book? [Dean nods in confirmation. Brenda laughs] Honey, now I know you’re lying. I doubt they can even read.
DEAN: Well, that has been up for debate. If it helps, I don’t plan on being nice about it when I do find them.
[Cashier Brenda perks up excitedly and runs a length of register tape off. She quickly writes down the girls’ location]
Cashier: You gonna be really mean?
DEAN: Yeah.
Cashier: ‘Cause it’s about damn time someone was. [she hands Dean the address]
DEAN: [smiling] Thank you.
Cashier: You’re welcome. [watching him walk away until we hear a door close] Mmm.

[Daylight. Interior of Baby, same day]
SAM: Even if you do get the book, and even if you get your power back, it won’t matter. You won’t ever be able to change what happened. You won’t be able to change how helpless you felt, or how helpless you feel. You’re still gonna get scared. And that feeling… that feeling never goes away.
ROWENA: Never?
SAM: Never. [Rowena opens the car door to exit] Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? Where are you going?
ROWENA: I just need a minute. I’m not fleeing. Don’t release the hounds.
[Dean approaches the two]
DEAN: Hey.
SAM: Hey.
DEAN: What’s going on?
SAM: Uh, she just needs a minute. She’s all right.
DEAN: All right, well, I got the address. Rowena was right. These girls are not fan favorites.
ROWENA: [joining the brothers] Right. Time to get that book.
DEAN: Oh, no, no. You’ve done your bit, okay? We’ll take it from here.
ROWENA: I was afraid you might say that. [walking away, she drops a hex bag in front of the boys who start] Manete! [freezing the boys in place]
SAM: Rowena! Rowena, stop!
DEAN: Rowena, damn it!
SAM: Oh, come on. All right. [Sam tried to reach for the hex bag while Dean tries to break free by power jumping]

[Interior Plum home. Daylight. Later that day. Rowena enters the home and we hear the girls talking]
JAMIE: Okay, so you don’t think it said anything?
JENNIE: I told you, there’s all kinds of weird writing. I was totally honest about that. Maybe there was something wrong with his soul. Maybe he was, like, a really bad guy or something.
JAMIE: Come on. He was obviously a total Boy Scout. I don’t think that really matters. We need to do something.
JENNIE: I’m looking. I’m looking.
ROWENA: You were supposed to get the book and wait for me.
JAMIE: I…Uh…
JENNIE: Okay, like, the Winchesters were all over us and–
JAMIE: And we didn’t want to call you. Because we can take care of ourselves.
ROWENA: I told you about the book, where to look for the boys. We had a deal. Now I’ve had to use them to find you.
JAMIE: You brought them here?
ROWENA: When you nincompoops ran, I did what I had to do. But I can still cast the spell. We can still complete our deal.
JENNIE: You’d still help us?
ROWENA: As long as you give me the book when we’re done. You don’t need it anyway. Witches of your level would–
JENNIE: [interrupting} “Witches of our level”?
ROWENA: Yes
JAMIE: Are you saying what our Mom taught us wasn’t good enough? Jennie, I think she’s saying we’re not good enough.
JENNIE: You think you’re so smart, huh? Well, we already did the spell.
JAMIE: Mostly.
ROWENA: Mostly?
[We see the figure of the dead woman previously laying on the table enter the room behind Rowena, breathing raspy, hissing breaths. Rowena turns to face the figure then turns back to the girls, walking away from the figure]
ROWENA: What have you done?
JENNIE: It’s like, step one of bringing her back.
JAMIE: We’ll figure out the rest after she kills you.
ROWENA: Unfortunate, but not my first zombie, luv. [swinging her arm at the figure] Abi!
JAMIE: Oh, side effect of the spell, she’s, like, magic-proof.
ROWENA: [Zombie comes after Rowena growling and hissing] Ooh!
JENNIE: And she’s totally gonna eat your brain.
[Rowena runs into another room slamming the door behind her. The zombie continues to growl and hiss as she proceeds to violently bang on the door]

[Exterior parking lot. Daylight]
DEAN: [irritated] Needed a minute, huh?
SAM: [trying to reach for the hex bag] You don’t have to say it, Dean.
DEAN: Oh, I’m gonna say it. She played you.
SAM: [defensively] She played us. And she’s scared.
DEAN: Yeah, well, she better be, Come on. You’re, like, 8 feet tall. You can’t reach that?
SAM: [straining to reach] I almost got it. Okay, got it, got it. All right.
[Sam stands up and passes the hex bag to Dean who has pulled his lighter from his pocket. Dean ignites the hex bag and we hear a whooshing sound as the boys are freed from their position]
DEAN: All right, let’s go kill some witches. [tossing the burning hex bag at Sam] You want that?
[The boys move to get into Baby]

[Exterior asylum/Hell’s prison. Daylight. We see both Castiel and Lucifer armed with bloody angel blades]
CASTIEL: There’ll be more of them coming.
LUCIFER: You know, this would be so much easier if I were stronger. Hint, hint, hint. [Castiel turns to face Lucifer incredulously] Come on Castiel. We just fought side by side, mano e mano. You gotta trust me now, man. Come on.
CASTIEL: Oh, I trusted you when we fought the Darkness, and then you betrayed us. And I trusted you–
LUCIFER: Ah!
[Lucifer unexpectedly swings his angel blade at Cas, who jumps back out of the way but is nicked on the ribs by the blade. We see Lucifer with his red eyes face off against Castiel]
CASTIEL: Fool me once…
LUCIFER: [eyes fading back to normal] I promise to leave you a little. Come on.
[Castiel steps forward and stabs Lucifer in the gut with his angel blade as deep as it will go. Lucifer’s eyes glow red again as the two are in a close embrace]
CASTIEL: This is me, learning from my mistakes. [We see Lucifer’s eyes flicker between normal and red]
ACT IV:
[Interior Plum home. Rowena is trapped in a room by the magic-proof zombie the young witches created]
ROWENA: [to herself] It’s just a magical zombie. You’ve dealt with worse than magical zombies before, Rowena. Oh! [we see the zombie’s arm smashing through the door] [To the girls in the other room] Clearly you wanted your mom back in better shape! I can still do that. [Rowena rummages through the kitchen drawers looking for anything to help her]
JAMIE: Nah, you missed your chance to play nice.
JENNIE: And you’re kind of all bark, no bite, so she’s gonna bite you.
JAMIE: [laughing] You’re terrible.
[Sam and Dean enter the home with guns drawn]
DEAN: Rowena!
ROWENA: Boys! Wonderful! I’ve been stalling them until you arrived.
JAMIE: Hey, lovebug. Can’t introduce you to Mom right now. She’s busy. How ‘bout that kiss I owe you?
DEAN: [cocking his gun] Sure.
JENNIE: [condescendingly] Guns. Okay, super scary.
DEAN: Witch-killing bullets.
[The girls look at each other and in unison swing their arms to cast a spell]
JAMIE/JENNIE: Moveantur!
[Sam and Dean are flung in opposite directions across the room, crashing into the furniture with grunts of pain. Jamie picks up a knife from the table and starts attacking Dean. Jennie is attacking Sam with a hammer. Both girls are giving the boys a good fight]
DEAN: Sammy! They’re really weirdly strong.
SAM: I think it’s probably a spell.
JENNIE: [laughing] You think?
[Jennie flings Sam across the room and he crashes into a coffee table. Jennie is moving in to attack but Dean has gotten the upper hand on Jamie and has her pinned against a wall]
JAMIE: Jennie!
[Jennie turns her attention to helping her sister and hits Dean in the back of the knee with the hammer. Jamie now has Dean at knifepoint again]
DEAN: Uhh! Aah! Son of a…
[We see the zombie finally break through the door and head toward Rowena who is trying to defend herself with a kitchen chair]
ROWENA: [frantically screaming to the boys] Magic won’t work on this abomination! Got any suggestions?! Quickly!
DEAN: Try shooting her in the head!
JAMIE: No!
[Sam continues to fight with Jennie and Rowena falls into the entryway with the zombie on top of her. Rowena spots Dean’s gun and struggles to reach it. The girls still have the upper hand on Sam and Dean and have them pinned to a large table. Rowena manages to reach the gun and fires it into the zombie’s head]
JENNIE: Mom! [the zombie falls to the floor with a thud]
ROWENA: [surveying the situation] Impetus Bestiarum!
[The girls immediately stop their attacks on Sam and Dean and the boys race out of harm’s way. The girls’ eyes turn red and we see Jamie with blood coming from her eyes as she is looking at Dean]
DEAN: Rowena.
ROWENA: [spitefully] End it.
[The girls turn towards each other, blood running from their eyes. Jamie stabs Jennie with her knife and Jennie hits Jamie with the hammer. They continue to exchange blows until they fall to the floor dead. Sam and Dean look on with bewildered as Rowena has a look of great satisfaction on her face]


ACT V:
[Interior Plum home. Daylight. A few moments later]
ROWENA: [paging through the Grimoire] You really thought after all that, I was going to try to kill you?
SAM: Yeah, you double-crossed us.
ROWENA: Triple-cross, actually. So I ended up on your side, and we defeated the villains, just as I planned.
SAM: Yah, not buying that.
DEAN: And that book? You’re either going to give it to us or we can take it, either way.
ROWENA: [pleading whispers to Sam] You know what I’ve seen, what it’s like. Lucifer may be locked away, but he’ll be back. He always comes back. And when he does… I can’t be helpless again. I need the spell.
[Sam, with a look of understanding, still takes the Grimoire from Rowena and she leaves]

[Interior MoL kitchen. Later that day. We see Sam opening two beers while Dean sits at the table in the background icing his injured knee. The Black Grimoire is on the table]
DEAN: Can’t believe I fell for a love spell. And I got clocked by a witch with a hammer.
SAM: And zombie mom. Those are the details that sell the story. [Sam hands Dean a beer]
DEAN: No, yeah, yeah. Getting beat up by a girl, that’s a story I wanna tell someone.
SAM: Girls beat us up all the time.
DEAN: [nodding in agreement, sips his beer] Mm. True. Hey, you know that Rowena is not our friend, right?
SAM: Yeah, I know.
DEAN: Hmm. [opens the Black Grimoire to where a page has been ripped from the book] So what’s that? [flips his finger at the torn page] You gave her the page. She got in your head man.
SAM: She didn’t get in my head.
DEAN: Look, what happened to Rowena was messed up, okay? But you just let the deadliest witch in the world walk away with a page from this book.
SAM: Yeah, and if Rowena breaks bad, I will hunt her down myself and put a bullet in her. I will Dean. But if she’s right, and if she does see Lucifer again, then… I hope she makes him suffer.
DEAN: You gotta get out of this dark place. You know, whatever’s going on in your head…
SAM: Dean.
DEAN: What?
SAM: [inhales deeply] You know what? Honestly?
DEAN: Yeah, how ‘bout honestly.
SAM: I know what Rowena is dealing with. And she’s not the only one who… [inhales deeply] feels helpless.
DEAN: What do you mean?
SAM: I mean, I had a plan, you know. I, uh… Help Jack, bring Mom back. It wasn’t much, but it was something. It – it kept me from spinning off the rails. And now… Jack is gone, Mom is still in hell, basically, and I-I-I- just…
DEAN: We’ll figure it out.
SAM: [defeated and angry] Dean, we don’t have a plan. We don’t know what to do. So – so how?
DEAN: [confidently] I don’t know. But we will, you and me. [takes a drink of beer]
SAM: Yeah. Night. [exits kitchen]
[Dean flips the Grimoire closed and lets out a deep sigh]

[Exterior of upscale hotel room. Night.]
[Rowena is sitting in the middle of a pentagram surrounded by numerous lit candles. Intense, suspenseful music in the background]
ROWENA: Ego sum filia naturae. Cum osculatione lunae. Da mihi vocem liberatam. Remitte vim meam. [more forcefully] Flam invincta. Ergo sum filia naturae. [we see a knife in one hand and the page from the Grimoire in the other] Cum osculatione lunae. [the pentagram on the page burns with a purple light] Da mihi vocem liberatam. Remitte vim meam. Flam invincta. [Rowena takes the knife and cuts a line down the length of her throat which glows with the same purple light. The light spreads out away from Rowena as she continues to gasp with excitement. Blood starts to drip from Rowena’s eyes as we see the warding ribbons binding Rowena appear. Blood continues to drip from her eyes as the bonds begin to break one by one. The music intensifies. The gash in Rowena’s neck and the blood from her eyes slowly disappear and a strong wind blows in through the window, extinguishing the candles. Rowena, still breathing heavily, composes herself and looks ahead, eyes glowing with a bright blue light as the intense music swells in the background and then fades]
