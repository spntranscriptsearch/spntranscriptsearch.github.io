TEASER

EXT: Night, we see a woman walking down the street towards a darkened building and watch as she enters a room filled with old antiques. A man behind the counter looks up as she approaches.

MRS. LLOYD: Hello?

BRICKLE: Ah! (Laughs) Mrs. Lloyd. (Singsongy) You're early.

MRS. LLOYD: I'm always early.

Where is it?

BRICKLE: All business. I like that. Solid gold. Look at that craftsmanship. (He holds out a gold pocket watch) Hmm? (Clocks whirring and clanking) No, ma'am, they don't make them like this anymore.

MRS LLOYD: Beautiful. (Chuckles as she looks it over) I brought cash.

BRICKLE: How thoughtful. Unfortunately, there has been a change. In the price.

MRS. LLOYD: But...we had a deal.

BRICKLE: Well, you call it a deal. I call it, uh, the start of negotiations. You know, tomato, tomahto. (Chuckles) I-I couldn't let it go for less than, uh, .

MRS LLOYD: (Scoffs) Are you out of your mind?

BRICKLE: Well, I'm not, but you folks are – are mad about this stuff.

I mean, personally, uh, I don't, uh, see the appeal. But if you're not interested, I can always, uh, find a new buyer.

MRS LLOYD: Do you know who you're talking to? Good luck finding that new buyer when the community finds out how I've been treated.

BRICKLE: Fine. Your loss. (turns to leave)

MRS LLOYD: Wait. What's that?

BRICKLE: Oh. I-I don't, uh… (smoke rises from his coat) Ah. Uh... (BRICKLE catches fire)

MRS LLOYD: No! No! (flames begin to consume her) (Screaming)

Aah! Oh, God!



INT: Men of Letters Bunker. Dean sits at the kitchen table typing away as Sam enters with grocery bags. SAM: Hey. Got everything on the list. So what are you thinkin', scrambled or fried?

DEAN: I'm not really hungry right now.

SAM: Y-you're not that...(Sam opens the box that contains a pie) How about some pie?

DEAN: (doesn’t look up) Maybe later. Kind of in the middle of something.

SAM:(Sighs) All right, dude, something's wrong.

DEAN: No.

SAM:(Sighs) I get it. If Mom –

DEAN: I'm gonna stop you right there, okay? Look, Mom needed her space, and I told you I'm cool with it.

SAM: But are you really?

DEAN: (sets down laptop) Happened last night.

SAM: (reads the computer screen) Killed in Mystery Fire.

DEAN: Mm-hmm. (checks out the pie)

SAM: Mystery fire?

DEAN: Yeah, the kind that doesn't burn anything but the bodies.

SAM: So spontaneous combustion. (Clicks tongue) What are you thinking?

Uh, witch? Dragon?

DEAN: Maybe. Check it out. The old lady? Loaded. I'm talking Scrooge McDuck swimming in pools of money. So what's a lady like that doing at some crap store at : a.m.?

SAM: Well, it says it was an antique shop.

DEAN: So?

SAM: Uh, rich people like antiquing. I don't know.

DEAN: I say we check it out.

SAM: Uh... (Sighs) All right. In the meantime, you sure you don't wanna talk about –

DEAN: No.

SAM: Dean, it's called sublimation.

DEAN: Yeah. Yeah, it's kinda my thing.



EXT: Antique shop, Sam and Dean approach and inspect the yellow tape that is pulled across the doors

SAM: Looks like we missed the Calvary.

DEAN: I guess we should go home then.

SAM: (as they enter the shop) All right, I'm guessing that's the first victim. (looking at a pile of ash)

DEAN: Scrooge McDuck lady?

SAM: Yeah. Hmm.

DEAN: Which makes this the antiques dealer. (noticing another pile)

SAM: Yeah. Name was Marvin Brickle. Widower. Owned the shop for decades.

DEAN: No sulfur.

SAM: (puts away a silent EMF reader) Ditto EMF.

DEAN: Maybe hex bags?

SAM: Yeah, or, uh, you know... antique shop, full of old stuff. Maybe the guy got his hands on a cursed object...and it went haywire, started killing everybody.

DEAN: Yeah, wouldn't be the first time.

SAM: Right. (Taps key on the computer as Dean moves to the second floor and knocks over a ship ) Dean... Dude...

DEAN: Don't say it.

SAM: May-maybe let's not touch anything until we figure out if this stuff wants to kill us or not?

DEAN: (whispers) Yeah, I got it. (Dean moves onto another part of the store as Sam works on the computer. Dean pulls open a hidden door) Sam, I think I found something.

SAM: (speaking from in front of the screen) It looks like the victims were meeting about an antique pocket watch the night they died.

DEAN: Pocket watch?

SAM: Yeah, according to Marv's e-mail, at least.

DEAN: (opens the door) Uh, SAM:?

SAM: Yeah, hold up. Get this – I hacked into Marv's hard drive. It – it looks like he was conducting...an entire underground business, uh, catering to, uh...

DEAN: (looking around the room) Nazi nutjobs?

SAM: Yeah. How'd you know that?

DEAN: Might wanna take a look at this.

SAM: Yeah. What are you, uh... (as he enters the room full of Nazi relics) Oh. That's, uh...Wow.

DEAN: Yeah. Looks like Scrooge McDuck lady got her rocks off by collecting Nazi crap.

SAM: Yeah, guess so. Uh, according to Marv's ledger, the watch belonged to a member of Hitler's inner circle.

DEAN: So where is it now?

SAM: I don't know. The police didn't report finding it. And I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that it's probably not out there and probably not in here.

DEAN: Yeah.

SAM: I mean...Nazi connection? The immolation M.O.? Sound like anybody we know?

DEAN: The Thule. (Exhales sharply)

SAM: Maybe they crashed the party, took the watch, and torched the bystanders.

DEAN: Nazis. I hate these guys.



INT: Ellie enters her apartment with a young man, kissing as they close the door.

ELLIE: Hey. (Giggles) Ooh! (Giggles) Mm. This is – this is fun. I-I don't really ever do this. And everyone's like, “Watch out for the hookup culture, Ellie.” Mmm! I think they just worry 'cause, you know, I-I just got out of a relationship. Um, but no, no, I gave – I gave back the ring, so that's just – that's all – that's a good thing, right? (Nick pauses to look at her in between her statements)

Sorry. Yeah, that was – I-I'm kinda still figuring out how the whole, you know, Tinder thing works.

NICK: It's cool.

ELLIE: Yeah, but, like...I could – I could be cooler, let's be honest. 'Cause, you know, like, your beard, it's super cool. Uh, do you want a drink? Yeah, I'm gonna – I'm gonna use the, uh, the little girls'...room and just... Okay. (Ellie makes a break for the bathroom. Whispering to herself) God. (Exhales deeply)

(in front of the mirror) Come on, Eleanore. He is hot. So you just – you put on those big girl pants and you take off his. Well...regular pants, not big girl pants.

NICK: Hey! (Ellie hears a loud bang and moves to open the door to investigate) What are you doing? ELLIE:?

(Ellie’s eyes grow wide as Nick catches on fire, and the men in the room begin to search for her)

NAUHAUS: Das Madchen!

ELLIE: Aah! (she closes the door, locking it the best she can but they begin to pound on door) Ah!



CUT TO: Ellie escapes out the window and Christoph follows her to the fire escape, aims a gun and is ready to shoot when a man grabs his arm.

NAUHAUS: (German accent) Idiot! We need her alive.

CHRISTOPH: I'm sorry, Father. (Sirens wail as Ellie makes her get away.)

NAUHAUS: Doesn't matter. (brushes his handkerchief along the blood line ELLIE left on the windowsill)

We have what we need to track her. Come.



INT: Sam and Dean sit at a diner table speaking with Aaron Bass on speakerphone from Germany

AARON: (on the speakerphone) We're halfway through the ledger. I nailed six, and the golem got the rest. It feels good, you know, finishing what the Judah Initiative started.

SAM: Your grandfather would be proud.

AARON: (dance music playing in the background) Yeah, well, dropping out of college to wipe out Nazi corpse-bags wasn't exactly my mother's dream, but what are you gonna do?

DEAN: Hey, uh, you hear about any Thule activity in our neck of the woods?

AARON: Not lately. These Deutsch-nozzles have been sticking to the Fatherland.

SAM: Lately?

AARON: Yeah. They're closing ranks. All jumpy.

SAM: Any idea what's cookin'?

AARON: Whatever it is, it's big. We got our hands on a few of their documents. Code named the mission “Das Blut” – “The Blood.”

SAM: The... (Scoffs) Wow, that sounds nice and ominous.

AARON: Right? I mean, we're talking the whole enchilada – the Thule High Command all in one place.

DEAN: Hey, does the, uh, this pocket watch mean anything to you, Nazi-relic wise?

AARON: No. Sorry.

SAM: (peeks at a notification) Hey, another body just dropped.

DEAN: Aaron, we're gonna have to call you back, bud. (he disconnects the call)



INT: ELLIE’s apartment as they roll away the body. Sam and Dean speak to a medic dressed as FBI.

Man: Ready? (Speaking indistinctly)

MEDIC: By the time we got there, he was ash and bone. What does that to a human being?

DEAN: You find anything else?

MEDIC: Just the body. The other victim was lucky. She got away, ran to her neighbor's, and called for help.

SAM: So where's the survivor now?



CUT TO: A police car, we see a man walking up to the parked car with ELLIE: inside

ELLIE: What's going on? I already gave my statement. What – what is happening? (the door opens and Christoph handcuffs her to the inside of the car, slamming the door shut) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. No, no, no, no, no! Let me out! Somebody, help! Help! Somebody help me! Let me out of here! Help! Please! Please, please, please. (Christoph climbs in the front seat) Please! Let me out of here!

(Engine starts) Help! Please!

(Sam and Dean exit the building just in time to see Ellie pleading for help)

DEAN: You see that?

SAM: Yeah.

DEAN: We gotta follow that car. Oh, I've always wanted to say that. (Engine revs, tires peal as the impala gives chase)



CUT TO: The police car pulls into a parking garage.

ELLIE: Why are you doing this to me? Please. Okay, look, look, I-I will give you whatever you want.

Okay? I-I don't really have any money, but my grandparents left me stocks. Just – just, please, tell me what's going on.

CHRISTOPH: Oh, my God.

Do you ever shut up?

ELLIE: Where you going? (Car door opens and Christoph gets out) Hey, you can't leave me here! Hey!

(Christoph searches the black SUV for keys

CHRISTOPH: Father...(speaking on the phone) Yes, I have her. I'm here now. It's all locked. That is not fair. You know, I try with you. I really do. But you expect me to be a mind reader, (still searching for keys)

and it's exhausting. (his rant is interrupted by the sound of a gun cocking) Father, I gotta go.

DEAN: Well, family drama's a bitch, ain't it?

DEAN: Move.



INT: Sam and Dean release Ellie and handcuff Christoph to a chair.

ELLIE: So if you're not cops, then what are you?

SAM: There are things out there that shouldn't exist. Bad things. We kill 'em. It's kind of our job.

DEAN: Yeah, so your safest place is with us right now.

ELLIE: Uh-huh. Safe from... Nazi zombies.

SAM: Necromancers. They use blood magic to make themselves almost immortal.

ELLIE: Almost?

DEAN: Well, you shoot 'em in the head, set 'em on fire, that usually does the trick.

ELLIE: This is completely insane.

SAM: Ellie, you saw what they did to your friend.

ELLIE: Okay, but... why – why would they kill Nick? And why kidnap me?

DEAN: Those are great questions. What do you tools want with the watch? And what does it have to do with her?

CHRISTOPH: You're gonna have to kill me.

DEAN: All right. Want to, uh...

SAM: Yep. All right, let's go for a walk.

ELLIE: Wait. No. No. You can't just shoot him.

DEAN: Oh, no, sure I can. (Cocks gun) See, I do it all the time.

ELLIE: Oh, my...

SAM: You don't wanna watch this.

CHRISTOPH: All right! All right, all right. Just... (sighs) It belongs to my father. Commandant Nauhaus, Thule High Command? Ranking officer?

SAM: Okay.

DEAN See, that wasn't so hard now, was it? Carry on.

CHRISTOPH: You don't understand. He'll kill me.

DEAN: What do you think this is, a tickle party?

CHRISTOPH: (sighs) It started at the end of the war.



INT: A flashback to Germany during the war as NAUHAUS sits and watches as Hitler sits before him.

(Bruckner's “Symphony No. 1 in E major” playing)

CHRISTOPH: (VOICE OVER) The Soviets had surrounded the Fuhrerbunker. Everyone knew it was over – everyone except my father.

NAUHAUS: (approaches Hitler who is about to pull the trigger on the gun and whispers in his ear) Es gibt einen anderen Weg.(There is another way)

DEAN: (VOICE OVER) All right, skip the foreplay. What did your dad do to Hitler?



CUT TO: Once more in the room where Christoph is handcuffed.

Christoph: He saved his life. Well, he saved his soul. Like, literally. The watch, it's like a – it's like a horcrux.

SAM: It's a Harry Potter thing.

DEAN: Oh, you would know that.

SAM: Anyways...so the watch holds Hitler's soul?

ELLIE: Right. You – you trapped Hitler's soul in a pocket watch? Why is that? For safekeeping?

(Scoffs)

CHRISTOPH: No. To bring him back. (Ellie laughs) It sounded bonkers to me the first time I heard it, too.

SAM: The first time you heard it? Weren't you there?

CHRISTOPH: What? No. Man, I was born in Buffalo in '94. Listen, this whole “let's bring Hitler back” is more of an O.G. Thule plan. All they do is yap about it.

ELLIE: He's joking, right? Right? This is – this is a joke.

DEAN: Okay, wait. Let's just – let's back up to the part where your dad is going to resurrect Adolph Hitler.

CHRISTOPH: (Sighs) After the bunker, the Thule agents who were smuggling Hitler's soul out got whacked by Soviets.

SAM: So you lost the watch.

CHRISTOPH: Hey, I didn't lose it. It ended up with some Russian family. Then the Thule tracked it to China and then to Peru. Then it wound up in that antique shop. So now they're all hyped to get their Fuhrer-resurrection on.

ELLIE: This isn't a joke. Oh, my God.

DEAN: How do they plan on bringing him back?

CHRISTOPH: The soul of Hitler can only inhabit the body of somebody who possesses his blood.

SAM: His blood. “Das blut.” So let me get this straight. The Thule want to upload Hitler into the body

of one of his relatives? Do they even exist anymore?

CHRISTOPH: Well, there's one right there. (he looks at Ellie)

ELLIE: Wait. Wait. You think I'm related to Hitler? Okay, okay, that – that – that is just hilarious.

CHRISTOPH: They've been keeping tabs on you your whole life.

The Thule track all of Hitler's descendants. You just happen to be in the same state as the watch.

(Chuckles) Go figure.

ELLIE: No. No way. Okay, my mom, she – she tracked our family all the way back to the Mayflower. She said –

CHRISTOPH: You're adopted.

ELLIE: You don't know anything about me.

CHRISTOPH: You're from Wheaton, Illinois. All-state cross-country all four years.

ELLIE: Wow. Wow, way to use the internet.

CHRISTOPH: You trained to become a doctor, but you dropped out at the sight of your first stiff.

ELLIE: I am taking a sabbatical.

CHRISTOPH: You dipped town two days before your wedding.

ELLIE: He was banging our caterer! You... (sighs)

CHRISTOPH: It seems as though this running is a thing for you.

ELLIE: I-I... (Grunts and whispers indistinctly as she leaves the room quickly)

CHRISTOPH: See?

SAM: (Dean looks at him) Yeah, I got her.

DEAN: We gotta move.

SAM: I know.



CUT TO: ELLIE sits in another room, pondering when SAM knocks on the door

SAM: Hey. How you holding up?

ELLIE: Well, I, uh, texted my mom, asked if I was adopted. (Voice breaking as she held back tears) She wrote, “Honey, call us.” That guy out there just flipped my life inside out in, like, five seconds.

SAM: Ellie, I know it probably feels like that right now, but you can handle this.

ELLIE: Being a little flighty, I can handle. Being related to the biggest genocidal maniac of all time?

I don't think so.



CUT TO: Christoph in the room with Dean as the wait for Sam and Ellie

CHRISTOPH: ( Exhales slowly ) It's been crazy hot lately, right?

That global warming...



CUT TO: garage, a car pulls into the parking garage, Nauhaus sniffs the bloodied cloth.

NAUHAUS: She's close.



CUT TO: Sam and Ellie in the small room

SAM: I know it's hard to believe this right now, but it will get easier. Trust me, I've been there.

ELLIE: Oh, right. Did someone wanna use you to resurrect Adolph Hitler?

SAM: Uh, w– No, not exactly.

ELLIE: There you go. ( Sniffles )

SAM: But they did want me to bring back Lucifer. I was his vessel –

ELLIE: You almost, almost had me with Hitler. But Lucifer? Really? The Devil? I can't, okay? I can't do this.

DEAN: (suddenly entering the room) All right, meltdown time's over. Listen, you need to face this now. Believe it or not, we actually have the upper hand here. According to, uh, you know, Junior Jackass in there, the Thule want you. Now we can use that. We can set a trap.

ELLIE: Oh. Oh, now you wanna use me as bait?

SAM: We don't want to use you as bait, Ellie, but...We have the opportunity to take out the entire Thule High Command in one shot.

DEAN: Now does that sound scary? Yeah, you bet. But there are times when you run and there are times

when you stand and fight. Now is one of those times when you fight. Now we promise that we will keep you safe.

ELLIE: (sees men coming in from behind Dean) Oh, my God.

DEAN: You gotta be kidding me.

SAM: (pushes Ellie to the ground) Get down.

MAN: They're in there. Yeah. Shh.

(Sam and Dean battle it out with two of the men as Christoph unties himself and both Sam and Dean are thrown around but they get their punches, and kicks in.)

(Man speaks German over earpiece) Verstanden? Ruckzug! Sie ist auf der Flucht!

MAN: Go! (and the three men run away)

SAM: Ellie? (he asks as he enters the room) Dean! We got a problem.



CUT TO: Ellie outside walking the street.

ELLIE: (almost running into a car door) Oh!

NAUHAUS: Hello.

ELLIE: Hey! Help!



INT: parking garage, Sam and Dean have changed out of their suits and Dean slams the trunk closed as Sam hangs up the phone

SAM: (cellphone beeps) She's still not picking up.

DEAN: Awesome.

SAM: Maybe she got spooked.

DEAN: Well, isn't running a whole thing with her?

ELLIE ON VOICEMAIL: Hey, it's Ellie. You know what to do.



CUT TO: inside of the limo with Christoph and Nauhaus as Ellie sits beside them tied and gagged.

SAM ON VOICEMAIL: Ellie, it's Sam Winchester. Again. Listen, I know all this Hitler stuff is confusing,

but I promise we can explain it. And we can keep you safe. Just call me back. Okay?

NAUHAUS: (ending the call) How could you tell them about Hitler?

CHRISTOPH: I can explain –

NAUHAUS: It wasn't bad enough being hunted by the Judah and his revolting golem?

CHRISTOPH: I was stalling. They would've killed me and taken her. You should be thanking me.

NAUHAUS: You were supposed to be my heir. Instead, you're an inconceivable disappointment.

CHRISTOPH: You know, I used to look up to you. You conquered death. You did so many things. But now? (Sighs) Now all you wanna do is relive your glory days with Hitler.

NAUHAUS: (scoffs) Your generation – you millennials – are too weak to steward the future. It needs a stronger hand. The world is divided und inflamed. This falling of empires, the flailing of economies, is precisely why there has never been a better time for the Fuhrer's return. And you... (Ellie whimpers)...my dear, you have his eyes.

ELLIE: (cries) Help! Somebody help me, please! Help me!



INT: diner, both Sam and Dean are searching through the Internet on their laptops

DEAN: All right, there's gotta be a tracking spell, right?

SAM: Yeah, maybe if we had something to track.

DEAN: Well, guess we hack every traffic light in the city until we find her.

SAM: (flaps lips)



CUT TO: limo pulls up in front of a building

ELLIE: (grunts) No! No! No! Wait! No! No! No! No! Don't! (crying and screaming)

NAUHAUS: Begin the purification ritual.

FRITZ: A patrol has been sent to find the Winchesters.

NAUHAUS: Good. Fritz, my son has had a very trying day. He should rest.

CHRISTOPH: What? Hey, no I'm – What are you doing? Get your hands off me, assclown. (Fritz leads him away towards the field) What are you doing? Father! Please! I was wrong! We can do it your way! Father, please! Fritz, look, you don't have to do this, okay? Come on. Listen, please, you know who I am.

(Gun cocks)

FRITZ: Go on.

Man over walkie-talkie:

Fritz. Come in, Fritz. Winchesters' Impala parked outside diner. Sawmill Road. (Christoph steals the gun and shoots Fritz)



CUT TO: diner as a waitress refills Dean’s coffee

DEAN: Gracias. Anything?

SAM: No. I-I-I mean, I have no idea how we're gonna find her. Even if we look at...

CHRISTOPH: (slides in beside Sam) Hi. (Dean cocks the gun under the table) If you wanna find Ellie

you have to protect me.

DEAN: Protect you? Why should we believe anything you say?

CHRISTOPH: (Sighs) Don't look now. Across the street, there's a Thule agent right beside the dumpster outside. Is that enough? I just killed one of my dad's guys.

SAM: Could be a trap.

CHRISTOPH: It's not. Do you know what it was like to have a Nazi necromancer for a father? It sucked. Christmas was a joke. Career Day at school was a nightmare. All I do is try to make him proud, I'll never be good enough. He asked a guy named Fritz to kill me.

DEAN: Okay, well, there's that.

SAM: We'll hear you out. Where is she?

CHRISTOPH: I can take you to her.

DEAN: All right, you get the car, I'll take care of the Kraut. All right.

SAM: Go.



CUT TO: Nauhaus and another man look over the body of Fritz.

NAUHAUS: The boy has some spine after all.

MAN: I'll find him.







NAUHAUS: Christoph’s time will come. For now... we have more important business.

(“Prelude” from Wagner's “Das Rheingold” is playing ) Ah, you always loved this one. Wagner. The perfect way to ease der Fuhrer into this new century.

MAN: She is prepared. Sehr gut.



CUT TO: Sam and Dean pull up in the car and both look around to make sure the coast is clear.

SAM: All right.

CHRISTOPH: Hey, what – what are you doing? (Handcuffs click as he is locked to the steering wheel)

Wait, you're just gonna leave me here?

SAM: Yeah, pretty much.

CHRISTOPH: What? Hey! Hey!

SAM: Shh.

DEAN: (he lowers the binoculars as Sam approaches) All right, we got two outside and who knows how many inside.

SAM: Great. (Dean reaches into the trunk)

DEAN: Ooh. (grabs the grenade launcher)

SAM: No.

DEAN: Why? (looks upset)

SAM: Dean, we need to be stealth, do this quietly. Dean? Dean. We'll get a chance. It's okay.

DEAN: (Sighs heavily putting it down and cocks the gun) Let's go kill some Nazis.



CUT TO: Ellie can hear the music playing but she is strapped to a gurney inside the building

ELLIE: What are you doing to me?

NAUHAUS: (laying on another gurney) The Fuher's soul must occupy a body that contains the blood of his blood. Hmm. Did you really think I'd resurrect the greatest man who ever lived in the body of a weak,

unworthy, American female? Mein Gott. I never needed you, only your blood.

MAN: (Speaking German praying over a book) das Fuhrer's. (Whispers) Ja.

NAUHAUS: I'm ready. (the watch disappears into Nauhaus's abdomen, his eyes open.)

HITLER: (he speaks German.) It’s been so long! (laughs maniacally)

ELLIE: Hitler?

HITLER: (suddenly jumps from the gurney) Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Ha ha! (Screaming, laughing)

Hans? (You look great! Not a day has passed!) Wolfgang. (How’s the wife?)

(Wolfgang stares at him.)

HITLER: (German: Oh, I guess she's probably dead.) Oh. (Laughing) (Speaks German to another man, Come here, handsome!) Come, come. Come! (Inhales deeply hugging him) Mm!

ELLIE: This can't...be happening....

HITLER: My great-great-grandniece. Thank you for the gift, Liebchen. Mwah!

HANS: What shall we do with her, Fuhrer?

HITLER: Take the rest of her blood, then give her to the dogs.

HANS: But, Fuhrer, we have no dogs.

HITLER: Then get some!!!! (Voice echoes) I love doggies. (Chuckles) Woof, woof, woof. (Laughs) Wolfgang, come on.



CUT TO: SAM and DEAN enter the building, making sure to be as quiet as they can.

DEAN: Should've just brought the grenade launcher. Admit it, though, you're having fun. (Guns cock)

SAM: Yeah, so much fun.

DEAN: (stands in front of Nauhaus) Well, if it isn't Father of the Year.

HANS: (smacks Dean) Address den Fuhrer with respect.

SAM: Fuhrer? Hitler?

DEAN: Hitler.

HITLER: Sam und Dean Winchester. You must be important. He feared you. (points to his head) Still up here. (Laughs)

DEAN: A nice new meat suit. It come with two testicles this time?

HITLER: One of many upgrades I'm enjoying. Like this! It's like having a tiny Goebbels in my pocket!

I sold 10 million copies of “Mein Kampf.” What do you think I can do with Twitter? (Chuckles and exhales sharply) Where is my plane?!?!?!?!

HANS: Almost ready, Fuhrer.

HITLER: Good.

HANS: What shall we do with them?

HITLER: Take them with us. I shall very much enjoy introducing them to my new dogs.

(Ellie, who had managed to get out of her bonds, fires off a shot, killing one man, a fight ensues)

HITLER: No, wait. Wait. (Breathing heavily) No. I-I can explain.

DEAN: (he knocks Nauhaus out and pulls his gun, aiming for his head) Heil this. (shoots him in the forehead)

ELLIE: (Exhales) Thank...

SAM: Dude...You killed Hitler.

DEAN: Yeah. Awesome.



EXT: Sam, Dean and Ellie walk away toward the Impala as the sun comes up.

DEAN: I killed Hitler. I killed Hitler. I killed Hitler. I think that entitles me to free drinks for the rest of my life. I'm gonna get t-shirts made.

SAM: You know no one's gonna believe you, right?

DEAN: But you believe me. You were there. (at the car, Dean opens the door and looks at Christoph) All right, let's go. (he unlocks the cuffs)

CHRISTOPH: Hold up, you're not gonna kill me?

DEAN: No, we had a deal. Besides, you got bigger problems.

SAM: The Thule that are left are gonna hunt you as a traitor forever. Our advice? Run.

DEAN: Why don't you head back to Buffalo? Nobody goes to Buffalo.

(Christoph disappears around the corner leaving the three of them to get into the Impala)



CUT TO: Sam and Ellie walk towards her apartment door after driving back to the city

SAM: So how you holding up?

ELLIE: Uh, well, we just burned a pile of dead Nazi zombie bodies. One of which I killed, so maybe, like, third worst day ever. I've had a rough time lately.

SAM: Yeah, and then all this happens.

ELLIE: I think I'm gonna be okay, though. I should probably call my mom. You can only run for so long,

you know? So, uh, what do you think is harder, facing the reincarnation

of Hitler or going back to med school?

SAM: I think I gotta say Hitler.

ELLIE: Yeah, I think – I think so. ( Chuckles )Thank you for everything.

SAM: Yeah. Uh...take care of yourself.

ELLIE: Yeah. (she walks inside)

SAM: (getting back into the car) Good to go.

DEAN: You know, I was thinkin'…We passed a bakery on the way into town. Sign said, “Best pie

for a thousand miles”.

SAM: So now you want pie?

DEAN: I killed Hitler. I think I deserve some pie. (starts the engine) Did I mention I killed Hitler?

SAM: I'm never gonna hear the end of this, am I?

DEAN: Probably not.

(The Impala drives away.)
