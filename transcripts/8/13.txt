NOW
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD – NIGHT


A person rides a motorcycle with a sidecar along a narrow road.


Vitsyebsk, Belarus

1944


Drums roll.


EXT. NAZI CAMP – NIGHT


The SOLDIER riding the motorcycle parks outside a large house with a Nazi banner. He approaches a SENTRY who is standing outside a smaller building.


SOLDIER
[raising an arm in a casual salute] Heil Hitler.


SENTRY
German: Du bist spät.
Subtitle: You’re late.


SOLDIER
German: Ist nicht meine Schuld. Es war des Schumachers Tochter.
Subtitle: Don’t blame me. It was the shoemaker’s daughter.


The SENTRY hands the SOLDIER a pass.


SENTRY
German: Glückspilz
Subtitle: Lucky bastard.


The SOLDIER walks past the SENTRY into the camp.


SENTRY
German: Hole dir die Tripper / Hole dir den Tripper (Last one would be correct, but it sounds like the first one)
Subtitle: Get the clap.


The SENTRY tries to light a cigarette, but his lighter won’t catch. Heavy footsteps approach and a shadow falls over the SENTRY, who looks up. The cigarette drops from his mouth and he screams.


INT. NAZI CAMP BUILDING – NIGHT


A SOLDIER looks out a window upon hearing the SENTRY’s scream. He steps back in alarm as the SENTRY crashes through the window. The SOLDIER checks the SENTRY’s body, but the SENTRY is dead. The SOLDIER sounds an alarm as heavy footsteps can be heard approaching.


A GERMAN SOLDIER (unseen)
German: Ja was is' hier los?
(Translation: What's going on?)


CUT TO:


A NAZI OFFICER pours blood from a jar into a large bowl. He looks up as screaming is heard. A soldier writing in a ledger (SOLDIER 2) and RADIO OPERATOR also look up, and the RADIO OPERATOR removes his headset. SOLDIER 2 continues to write. Yet another soldier (SOLDIER 3) slides a table in front of the door. SOLDIER 2 closes the ledger and hands it to SOLDIER 3.


RADIO OPERATOR
[speaks in German, wearing his radio headset again]
German: Das Ding ist nicht aufzuhalten - es hat die Linie am Osttor durchbrochen.
Subtitle: The thing won’t go down – it broke through the lines at the east gate.


SOLDIER 3 carries the ledger into an adjoining, well-appointed room where the NAZI OFFICER is standing behind a desk. He puts the ledger into a briefcase on a small table near the desk. Screaming and gunfire can be heard from outside the building.


RADIO OPERATOR
German: Herr Hauptmann - es hat Richter schon in zwei Hälften gerissen!
Subtitle: Commandant – it tore Richter in half!


SOLDIER 3
German: Mein Gott - was ist das?
Subtitle: My god – what is it?


NAZI OFFICER
German: "Es" kommt Sie zu töten, Soldat. Ich schlage vor, Sie halten Ihre Waffe bereit. Ihr alle! Zerstört es, oder sterbt.
Subtitle: “It” is coming to kill you, soldier. I suggest you ready your weapon. [He raises his voice.] All of you. Destroy it or die.


SOLDIER
German: Schmeißt den Tisch um!
(Translation: knock over the table!)

Three SOLDIERS tip a table on its side and stand behind it in a line, pointing their guns at the door. The NAZI OFFICER adds ingredients to the blood in the bowl.



NAZI OFFICER
German: Ich verfluche euch, Hexen von Abraham -
Subtitle: Damn you, sorcerers of Abraham –


The SOLDIERS look at each other as heavy footsteps approach. The NAZI OFFICER lights a match and picks up a candle. The RADIO OPERATOR takes off his headset.


NAZI OFFICER
[speaks in Latin]
Subtitle: Cloaking flame, I ignite you.


The SOLDIERS fire as someone breaks in the door. A VERY LARGE MAN enters and the RADIO OPERATOR shoots at him with his handgun. The VERY LARGE MAN lifts the RADIO OPERATOR out of his chair. The NAZI OFFICER lets wax from a candle drip into the bowl as the RADIO OPERATOR screams.


NAZI OFFICER
[speaks in Latin]
Subtitle: The fire born from blood leaves behind no man.


We hear the sound of bones breaking. Blood runs down the RADIO OPERATOR’s body, which we see only from his shoulders down. The NAZI OFFICER adds another ingredient to the bowl.


NAZI OFFICER
[speaks in Latin]
Subtitle: Now vanish me into the night.


GERMAN SOLDIER
German: Schießt auf Ihn!
(Translation: Shoot him!)


The three SOLDIERS fire as the VERY LARGE MAN approaches them. The VERY LARGE MAN’s body is riddled with bullets, but he appears unaffected. He grabs one of the SOLDIERS and there is the sound of breaking bones. The NAZI OFFICER lights a match from the candle.


NAZI OFFICER
[speaks in Latin]
Subtitle: O fire of power and concealment.


One of the SOLDIERS falls to the ground and again we hear the sound of breaking bones. We see a close-up of the briefcase.


NAZI OFFICER
German: Sag deinen Meistern: "Das ist lange noch nicht vorbei!"
Subtitle: Tell your masters this thing is far from over.


As the VERY LARGE MAN approaches him, the NAZI OFFICER throws the lit match into the bowl and flames erupt. The VERY LARGE MAN knocks the briefcase off the small table. The NAZI OFFICER disappears and the flames engulf the desk and the briefcase. We see the face of the VERY LARGE MAN for the first time.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)

ACT ONE
EXT. BUNKER – DAY


The IMPALA pulls up outside a bunker.


Lebanon, Kansas


DEAN and SAM get out of the IMPALA and walk towards the entrance of the bunker, which is built into a bank. The bunker appears to be a two-story building above ground level.


DEAN
When's the last time somebody was in this place?


SAM
Sixty-five, seventy years ago.


DEAN opens The Box and takes out the key inside it. SAM and DEAN walk down a short flight of stairs to the door.


INT. BUNKER – DAY


DEAN and SAM enter and shine their flashlights over a railing at the level below them, revealing 1950s-style communications equipment.


DEAN
Son of a bitch.


SAM
Look at this. Ham radio, telegraph, switchboard. This was their nerve center.


DEAN
Henry did say that they ran dispatch on their own team of hunters. [He shines his flashlight on a table containing a chess board, ashtray, glass and a dirty coffee cup.] Wow. Halfway through their coffee and a game of chess – looks like whoever was manning the hub left quick.


SAM
On the alarm call that ended the Men of Letters.


DEAN opens a switch box on the wall and pushes a lever. Lights come on. DEAN pushes another lever.


SAM
Son of a bitch.


DEAN joins SAM downstairs and they walk to the doorway of a large, attractively furnished room with bookshelves, polished wooden floors and large wooden tables. "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan" by Ella Fitzgerald begins to play.


DEAN
Sammy, I think we found the Bat Cave.


CUT TO:


We see a close-up of a record playing.


♪ Get thee behind me, Satan


DEAN walks into the “Bat Cave” room, wearing a gray bath robe and slippers. Books are spread over the tables and SAM is leaning over reading from two of them.


DEAN
Morning.


SAM
Morning.


DEAN
The, uh, water pressure in the Letters' shower room is marvelous.


SAM
Yeah. I still can't figure out how we even have water... or electricity. [He walks to the shelves to get another book.]


DEAN
Yep, well, I am putting that under the "ain't broke" column. Listen, little brother, let's not go all geek on this stuff, okay?


SAM
"Geek"?


DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, don't – don't get me wrong. [He lifts a scimitar from a display stand.] This stuff is awesome, and it looks like they ran a real tight outfit here, but I'm just saying, you know, don't, uh, don't think that they knew some big secrets that we don't know.


DEAN strikes some poses with the scimitar while SAM’s back is to him. As SAM turns, DEAN quickly straightens up.


SAM
Dean... they were a secret society.


DEAN
Which means that they made crap up and wore fezzes and sashes and swung around scimitars. They probably didn't even sharp– [DEAN runs his finger along the blade and cuts himself] That's very sharp. [He replaces the scimitar on the stand.]


SAM
Dean, look, I think we might have something here – something that could help us, help humanity. Henry certainly thought so. I mean, you know damn well we could use a break. What if we finally got one? [They look at each other for a moment, then DEAN looks away.] Are you gonna take off the dead-guy robe?


♪ He promised to wait


EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS – DAY


Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania


INT. LIBRARY – DAY


An OLD MAN wearing a black hat walks up to a library counter where a LIBRARIAN is standing.


LIBRARIAN
Well, well... It's so late. I didn't expect you in at all.


OLD MAN
Three times I had to transfer the bus lines to lose him today.


LIBRARIAN
Right – your sinister friend.


OLD MAN
You don't believe me I'm being followed. Nobody ever does. So, yes, I would like to see, uh, [he reads from a notebook] manuscript FD113 from the Holtzinger estate.


LIBRARIAN
Oh, my. You're going to catalogue that whole collection for us, aren't you?


OLD MAN
If I have to.


CUT TO:


A WOMAN wearing white gloves puts a large box labeled “FD113” down on a table in front of the OLD MAN. He removes his black hat and is wearing a skullcap underneath.


OLD MAN
Thank you.


WOMAN
Um-hmm.


The OLD MAN puts on white gloves and opens the box. Inside is a red ledger. He runs his fingers down the first entries, then flips quickly through more pages before sitting back in his chair.


OLD MAN
Gottenyu.


CUT TO:


The OLD MAN puts the red ledger down on the library counter in front of the LIBRARIAN.


OLD MAN
This book – we need to protect it. This thing they put on me – he's too close! I can't take this ledger with me!


LIBRARIAN
Of course you can't. It's part of the special reference section, where it will be perfectly safe.


OLD MAN
Oh. Oh. Oh. I still have 10 minutes, yes?


LIBRARIAN
Eight minutes... before all materials must be returned to the main desk.


The OLD MAN smiles and speaks in Yiddish.


OLD MAN
Subtitle: I hope they pay you good to keep that bug up your ass.


EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS – NIGHT


The OLD MAN leaves the library and looks around. A MAN is watching him from a distance.


INT. CAMPUS PUB – NIGHT


The OLD MAN makes a call on a pay phone in the pub.


EXT. CAMPUS PUB – NIGHT


A BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT watches through the pub windows.


INT. CAMPUS PUB – NIGHT


VOICE ON PHONE MESSAGE
Leave a message after the tone.


OLD MAN (on phone)
Now, listen to me carefully. I got no time left. I found it! I found it! When you – when you follow me here, you – you – you’re gonna need this number here – Q...


EXT. CAMPUS PUB – NIGHT


The BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT watches.


INT. CAMPUS PUB – NIGHT


The OLD MAN slowly hangs up the phone. He walks towards the windows. As students watch, he smiles and calls out to the BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT outside.


OLD MAN
Why so shy? Come in! Come in out of the cold! You'll have a cup of coffee with – with your old enemy. You Nazi piece of rubbish!


The OLD MAN begins to sizzle and smoke rises from his body. Students gasp in alarm.


OLD MAN
You Nazi pig!


The OLD MAN’s skin burns and he is engulfed in flames. Students scream and run away.


EXT. CAMPUS PUB – NIGHT


The BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT watches the fire, then turns to leave.


EXT. BUNKER – DAY


Two Weeks Later


The IMPALA is parked outside.


INT. BUNKER – DAY


DEAN enters, carrying a duffel bag. He calls out to SAM as he walks towards the “Bat Cave” room, where SAM is sitting in front of his laptop at a table.


DEAN
Hey!


SAM
Hey! So... how's Kevin doing?


DEAN
You know. He's okay, I guess. In his corner, hacking out his Da Vinci code – nothing actionable yet. [He takes a beer out of the refrigerator.] Garth says hi, by the way. Anything from Cas?


SAM
[smiles] No. Not – not a peep. Why? You?


DEAN
No, he's, uh – he's not answering.


SAM
Right. Well, uh, so I have been [DEAN sits down opposite him] trying to chart out the Letters' network of hunters, their allies, uh, affiliated groups they worked with, kept files on…


DEAN
Circa 1958?


SAM
Yeah. True. Uh, most are dead or defunct, but others – I'm not so sure, and this one... you should definitely check out. [He puts a file with the Aquarian Star symbol on it in front of DEAN.]


DEAN
The Judah Initiative?


SAM
European team – they were active during World War II.


DEAN
Really? Hunters fighting in a war – that's cool.


SAM
Not exactly hunters, n-not exactly fighting, but, uh...


DEAN
Rabbis? Rabbis? [SAM nods.] Really?


DEAN looks at a photograph of a group of men in the file.


SAM
The Letters' file on them is – is sketchy, but, apparently, they were hard-core saboteurs. So, I ran a search on the Initiative's entire roster, and I got a hit – one Rabbi Isaac Bass. He was 17 years old when he joined the Initiative and 85 years old when he died... two weeks ago. [He turns his laptop towards DEAN.] In a college town back east, he was capped.


DEAN
"Capped"?


The headline of the Wilkes-Barre Monitor article on the laptop screen reads “Freak Accident on Campus.”


SAM
Yeah. He was there doing research, and according to eyewitnesses, he spontaneously combusted.


DEAN
So… this is a case? [SAM raises his eyebrows and DEAN looks around the room as if he doesn’t want to leave.] I just got back.


EXT. LIBRARY – DAY


The IMPALA stops for a moment and SAM gets out, then it drives off.


LIBRARIAN (V-O)
So you... worked with the late Rabbi Bass?


INT. LIBRARY – DAY


SAM, wearing jeans, a jacket and a vest, stands at the counter talking to the same LIBRARIAN who spoke to RABBI BASS.


SAM
I was a research associate of Rabbi Bass, yes. I'm trying to complete his last paper for publication. I'd just like to review what he was after here.


LIBRARIAN
Well, that would be quite a lot of material. He was here open to close for almost a week.


SAM
Wow. Um, how about just the stuff he was looking at... you know, the day he, uh... caught fire?


LIBRARIAN
Does shorten the list a bit.


INT. CAMPUS PUB – DAY


Two ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN in matching sports uniforms are sitting across a table from DEAN, who is wearing a suit.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 1
He was a really nice old kook.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 2
Really nice.


DEAN
Kook? How so?


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 2
You know, he'd talk a lot to us, to himself, to anyone who'd listen. He was always talking about this secret war that nobody knew was going on.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 1
Conspiracy stuff – he was obsessed with Nazis.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 2
But he said they were "Special Nazis." You know, necromancers.


DEAN
Necromancers?


A BEARDED YOUNG MAN carrying a fruity drink with a pink umbrella in it sits down at a table nearby. He appears to be watching DEAN.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 2
Yeah, like from that world of whatever-craft that my little brother is always playing.


DEAN
Nazi... necromancers.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 1
It's sad, isn't it – that old people have to go so crazy?


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 2
I know. It is sad.


DEAN
Hmm.


DEAN looks at the BEARDED YOUNG MAN, who is staring at him. The BEARDED YOUNG MAN smiles and raises a hand.


DEAN
You, um... [the BEARDED YOUNG MAN looks away] I'm sorry. You, uh, you both saw the accident?


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 1
I can still hear his screams.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 2
It was like the fire was alive, like – like it was attacking him.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 1
It was like watching the most awful movie of the most terrible thing you could possibly see.


ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 2
It was like that.


DEAN
Yeah.


DEAN looks at the BEARDED YOUNG MAN again. After meeting DEAN’s eyes for a moment, the BEARDED YOUNG MAN looks down.


INT. LIBRARY – DAY


A woman pushing a trolley leaves SAM at a table with the box labeled “FD113.” SAM, who is wearing white gloves, opens the box and takes out “The Explorer’s Guide to North American Birds.”


INT. CAMPUS PUB – DAY


DEAN holds up his FBI badge to the BEARDED YOUNG MAN.


DEAN
Special Agent Bolan.


DEAN puts his badge on the table and the BEARDED YOUNG MAN looks at it.


BEARDED YOUNG MAN
Oh, really? Wow. I thought you were like a headhunter or something. [He laughs.]


DEAN
This is the second, maybe third time I'm seeing you today? Why you following me, Gingerbread?


BEARDED YOUNG MAN
Oh, so we, um... we didn't have a thing back there, huh?


DEAN
Back where? W-what, now?


BEARDED YOUNG MAN
I'm sorry, man. I – I thought – I thought we had a thing back at the quad, you know – a little "eye magic" moment, and I saw you here [DEAN picks up his badge] and I figured I'd wait until you were done with your meeting and then maybe we might, uh...


DEAN
Yeah. Uh, okay, but no – uh, no moment. This is a... federal investigation.


BEARDED YOUNG MAN
Is that supposed to make you less interesting? No. I – I'm sorry, man. I hope – I hope I didn't freak you out or anything.


DEAN
No. No. I – I'm n-not freaked out. It's just a, you know... a federal thing. It's, uh... Okay… [his phone rings] citizen. As you were.


DEAN walks away.


BEARDED YOUNG MAN
You have a good night.


DEAN
You – you... [ he turns back to the BEARDED YOUNG MAN and bumps into a table, causing glasses to knock against each other] have a – okay.


DEAN leaves the pub.


EXT. CAMPUS PUB – DAY


DEAN answers his phone.


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah.


SAM (on phone, V-O)
Hey.


EXT. LIBRARY – DAY

We see SAM from a distance, as if through the eyes of someone watching him.


SAM (on phone)
Hey. So I, uh, looked into the rabbi's research. It doesn't make a lot of sense –


SAM pauses and looks around. The camera shifts as if the person watching him ducked behind a corner.


SAM (on phone)
Um, bird watching.


The scene alternates between DEAN walking away from the campus pub and SAM walking away from the library.


DEAN (on phone)
Huh. Well, uh, the two very hot co-captains of the women's volleyball team agree that the rabbi's death was very unnatural. I think we still got a case.


SAM (on phone)
That would explain why I have something stuck to my shoe.


DEAN (on phone)
You being followed?


SAM (on phone)
Yeah, I think so.


DEAN (on phone)
That's weird. I thought I was being followed earlier. Turned out to be a gay thing.


SAM (on phone)
What?


DEAN (on phone)
Nothing. You need a hand?


SAM (on phone)
Yes, please. Got someplace quiet?


DEAN (on phone)
Visitors’ parking – the boonies. I'll park in the back. 30 minutes.


EXT. VISITORS’ PARKING AREA – NIGHT


SAM walks to the trunk of the IMPALA. He fumbles the keys, deliberately drops them to the ground and crouches down to pick them up. DEAN walks up behind a LARGE MAN, who crouching in the bushes watching SAM.


DEAN
Hey, pal.


The LARGE MAN stands up, towering over DEAN, and we see that he is the VERY LARGE MAN from 1944.


DEAN yells as he goes flying through the air. He crashes into the IMPALA, breaking a side window, and falls to the ground.


SAM
Dean?


DEAN groans. The VERY LARGE MAN steps out of the bushes and heads for SAM, who opens the trunk of the IMPALA and takes out a machete. SAM swings the knife at the VERY LARGE MAN and it gets stuck in his forearm. DEAN rolls over onto his front on the ground and raises his head to watch. With an effort, SAM pulls the knife free. The VERY LARGE MAN grabs SAM by the throat and lifts him off the ground.


MAN’S VOICE
Stop.


The VERY LARGE MAN lets go of SAM. The BEARDED YOUNG MAN from the campus pub walks up.


DEAN
Oh, my spleen. Ahh!


SAM
What... the hell... is that?


BEARDED YOUNG MAN
He's a Golem. Well, he's my Golem.


SAM
Right.


With a grimace, DEAN flops onto his back.


ACT TWO
INT. HOUSE – NIGHT


The BEARDED YOUNG MAN opens the door. The GOLEM pushes him aside and walks past him into the house. The BEARDED YOUNG MAN, DEAN and SAM follow.


BEARDED YOUNG MAN
The rabbi who was murdered, Isaac Bass – he was my grandfather. That's why we're here. When you guys started to follow up on his case, we started following you.


The GOLEM paces the room.


DEAN
So, wait. What you're saying is that you and me – we, uh, didn't have a moment?


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
No, man. I was tailing you.


DEAN
[to SAM] Told you I was being followed. He was my gay thing.
[to RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON] It was really good. You really had me there. It was very smooth.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Yeah, well, smooth is just about all I got. [The GOLEM looks at him.] What?


The GOLEM grunts.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Yeah, that's right. Keep walking... you Chia Pet.


The GOLEM makes another noise.


SAM
So, that's a Golem?


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Yes. Shaped from clay and brought to life by rabbis to protect the Jewish people in times of – I don't know – general crappiness.


SAM
And he's yours?


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Hardly. My grandfather left him to me. I'm the last surviving descendant of the members of this... thing, this... Initiative.


SAM
The Judah Initiative?


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Right, and he –


GOLEM
[directly behind SAM and DEAN, growling] Who?! [DEAN and SAM jump and look around in alarm.] Who are they to know about the men of Judah?


DEAN
It's okay.


EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT


The BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT watches through the windows.


INT. HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN
We are the good guys.


SAM
W-we're hunters, uh – Sam and Dean Winchester. We know about The Judah Initiative because our grandfather was a Man of Letters.


GOLEM
Yes. The rabbis knew the Men of Letters.


EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT


The BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT watches through the windows.


INT. HOUSE – NIGHT


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON hands beers to DEAN and SAM.


DEAN
Thank you.


SAM
Thanks.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Take a seat. So... your grandfather was into all this supernatural stuff, too?


DEAN
Yeah, grandparents, mom, dad, truckload of cousins – the whole family was lousy for it, but we... [he looks at the GOLEM, which is still pacing] never had a Golem.


SAM
Right. Yeah. We, um, we grew up in it, but you... didn't?


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
My grandfather's adventures, the Initiative, the Golem, the war – they were the stories that he told me when I was a kid. I thought it was make-believe. So did my parents – you know, fantasies to help him cope with all the horrible stuff he'd seen, but every once in a while, crazy old Grandpa Bass would come back by on one of his trips, hand me a $20 savings bond, and say, "one day, you'll inherit the mantle." Sure enough, a few days after he died, this big box shows up at my apartment. He always said I’d know what to do. Which was crap, because when I opened that box, this big, naked, potato-faced lunatic wakes up and goes crazy!


We see the scene briefly from outside the house as the GOLEM looks out the window.


GOLEM
I didn't... go crazy.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
You trashed my entertainment center! And my water bed.


GOLEM
This boy knows nothing, observes none of the mitzvahs, labors on Sabbath, dines on swine.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Everybody loves bacon!


GOLEM
He's no rabbi. Yifalchunbee!


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
[holds up a hand] Oh, don't start with that stuff again.


GOLEM
Yifalchunbee!


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Enough! Please! Quiet time!


The GOLEM resumes pacing around the house.


SAM
All right. What was that? What was he saying?


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
It's Hebrew for something like "take charge," but I have no idea what he means. Look, I grew up in Short Hills. I cheated my way through Hebrew school. I never really listened to my grandfather, what he was saying.


DEAN
So, wait – he just sends you this – this Golem and expects you to work it out?


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
He didn't get much chance to prepare me, I guess. My parents – they did everything they could to prevent him from screwing me up with all his crazy talk. See, after the war, my grandfather spent the rest of his life trying to track down something he called the Thule Society.


SAM
The Thule Society. Right. They were Nazis.


DEAN
Nazi necromancers.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
N-necro-who?


SAM
Uh, necromancer – uh, witches, sorcerers, dark magic, mostly with dead people.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
[uncertainly] Okay. All I know about the Thule is that they were this twisted, secret fraternity, hell-bent on world domination, that sponsored the early days of the Nazi Party. My grandfather said The Judah Initiative was started to fight them.


GOLEM
And the Thule murdered your grandfather, boy. Find them so I can do my work! [He smashes a side table.]


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Hey! Hey!! We're renting here! Renting.


The GOLEM walks into the kitchen.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Look... I think my Golem's right. My grandfather – he left me this message on my machine the day he died, and he said that he had found something that the Thule were willing to kill him for. He said he was hiding it here in plain sight. He left me this weird – I don't know – equation. [He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket.] It's not a phone number or an address or coordinates – Q-L-6-7-3-W-3-8? [He hands the piece of paper to DEAN.]


DEAN
Is it a combination? [He hands it to SAM.]


SAM
Oh, it's a call number. Library of Congress – their filing system. They use it in college libraries. Uh, Q-L-6-7-3 – that... that's sciences. Uh... birds, I'm guessing. Let's go.


SAM heads for the door. DEAN smirks at RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON.


EXT. LIBRARY – NIGHT


INT. LIBRARY – NIGHT


SAM, DEAN, RABBI BASS’S GRANDSON and the GOLEM enter the library. DEAN is holding lock picks.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
What, do you two just break in wherever you go?


DEAN
Yeah, well, our dad wanted us to have a solid career to fall back on, just in case this hunter thing didn't pan out.


SAM reads a directory sign on the wall. Sciences are on Level 2.


SAM
Okay, so if I'm right, then I think your grandfather switched manuscript FD113 out of the archives. I'll be right back.


SAM runs up the stairs. DEAN sits down to wait at the bottom of the stairs.


CUT TO:


SAM walks past bookshelves on Level 2 and finds the section he’s looking for. Just as he takes the red ledger off the shelf, he is hit at the top of his jaw with a dart. He pulls it out with a grunt. The skin turns a dark purple and he winces, groans and blinks as if his vision is blurring. He staggers back against the bookshelf behind him, then starts to unsteadily walk away with the ledger.


BESPECTACLED MAN IN SUIT
I owe you thanks. [He steps out from behind a bookshelf.] The rabbi got me this far, but you... [the picture blurs as we see him through SAM’s eyes] took me all the way. Now, give me the ledger.


SAM kicks a trolley at the BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT and staggers away.


SAM
Help! [DEAN looks around at SAM at the top of the stairs.] N-necromancer!


DEAN
[to RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON] Stay here!


DEAN runs up the stairs as SAM falls on a landing partway down the stairs. DEAN sees the large purple bruise on SAM’s jaw and neck.


DEAN
Crap.


A dart hits RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON in the chest.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Aah! Aah.


DEAN
Crap! [to the GOLEM] Hey, big guy, they're both gonna die unless we get whoever cast the spell.


The GOLEM runs up the stairs as DEAN crouches with a hand on SAM’s back.


DEAN
[to SAM] Come on. Come on. [He helps SAM up.]


CUT TO:


The GOLEM walks past bookshelves on Level 2. The BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT is hiding at the end of one of the bookshelves.


CUT TO:


DEAN touches SAM’s face where the dark purple discoloration is spreading. RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON lies on his back on the floor, breathing shallowly.


CUT TO:


The GOLEM walks along bookshelves on Level 2. A dart hits him in the side of the face. He pauses and removes it.


CUT TO:


DEAN removes the dart in RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON’s chest.


CUT TO:


The GOLEM reaches a hand forcibly through the shelves, knocking books out of the way. He grabs the BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT and pulls him hard against the shelves.


CUT TO:


DEAN looks up at the noise.


CUT TO:


The GOLEM knocks the BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT against the shelves again, then lets him drop to the floor.


CUT TO:


DEAN points his gun up the flight of stairs. The GOLEM drags the BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT partway down the stairs. SAM’s eyes are closed. The GOLEM drops the BESPECTACLED MAN IN A SUIT on the landing. The (no longer bespectacled) MAN IN A SUIT raises his head.


MAN IN SUIT
Long live the Thule.


The GOLEM breaks the MAN IN A SUIT’s neck. The discoloration on SAM’s face and neck fades and he opens his eyes.


DEAN
Or not.


ACT THREE
EXT. – NIGHT


We see a close-up of one of the IMPALA’s headlights. RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON takes a deep breath and sits up in the back seat. The GOLEM is standing next to the IMPALA. RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON puts a hand to his chest where he was hit with the dart.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
Oh... man.


GOLEM
The Men of Letters healed you. They saved your life.


SAM and DEAN are standing with shovels next to piles of dirt. A body wrapped in a sheet lies on the ground. They toss the shovels down.


RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON
What are they doing?


GOLEM
Burying the necromancer.


DEAN and SAM pick up the body and drop it into the grave.


DEAN
That's like a bag of Legos. The Golem destroyed this guy.


SAM
Yeah. So, uh...Thule Society necromancers aside, what's our contingency plan on that?


DEAN
You mean how do we "oh, no!" Mr. Bill over there?


They pour accelerant over the body.


SAM
I mean, I'd like to think we could if we had to. Unless you think Aaron can get a handle on him.


As AARON (RABBI BASS’ GRANDSON) watches open-mouthed and the GOLEM watches impassively, DEAN tosses a lit match into the grave.


AARON
Oh, my God. These guys are psychopaths.


SAM warms his hands over the fire.


INT. AARON’S HOUSE – DAY


DEAN enters carrying a tray of coffees. SAM and AARON are at the table. SAM is using a German to English translator on the laptop. The English translation reads “May 12, 1944. The Commandant has been informed that group one has responded favorably to the latest trials. Proceed w–”


DEAN
What'd you find out?


SAM
I think it's a log-book from a Nazi compound in Belarus. [DEAN sets coffees in front of SAM and AARON.] It was run by the Thule.


AARON is reading the ledger.


AARON
This is the red ledger. [DEAN joins them at the table.] It was lost in the fire that destroyed the compound, but my grandfather was convinced it had been found after the war.


SAM
Well, it describes the horrible experiments [the GOLEM walks into the room] performed on the camp's population. Magical experiments.


GOLEM
More horrible than words.


SAM
You were there, weren't you? At the camp?


GOLEM
I was made in the ghetto of Vitsyebsk to tear that hell down. I broke its walls, its men. The commandant burnt the place to ash around me.


SAM
Okay, um, w-what does it mean when – when you tell Aaron to take charge?


GOLEM
The boy would know... if he could consult the pages.


DEAN
Pages? W-what pages?


AARON
When I was – when I was bar mitzvahed, my – my grandfather gave me this little old book. It was in Hebrew. It was like an owner's manual for a Golem.


DEAN
Okay. Great. Get that, then.


AARON
I – I can't, exactly. When I went to high school, I sort of... drifted. I started getting off the academic track, and, uh, I kind of, um... I kind of smoked it.


GOLEM
The boy smoked the pages.


AARON
They were these thin, vellum-y pages. I mean, it was perfect for rolling. Look, they were driving instructions for a clay man. Okay? It was nonsense. Right? I mean… I... Okay. All right. Look, I'm sorry, okay? Why can't you just tell me what I don't know?!


GOLEM
[slamming his hands onto the table and leaning over it] It's not my place to guide the rabbi, to teach the teacher! It's not my place! Yifalchunbee!


The GOLEM walks into another room.


DEAN
That's not super-comforting, got to say.


AARON nods. DEAN gets up and walks to the sink.


SAM
So, as far as I can tell, these experiments – the Thule were murdering Jews, gypsies – just about anybody and everybody – [DEAN eats something] then trying to magically reanimate them. They were trying to figure out a way to bring their own dead back to life... which I'm guessing they figured out because – this. [He turns pages of the ledger.] This last page is a roster of every dead Thule member who was reanimated.


AARON
This is why they killed my grandfather?


DEAN
Anything in there on how to kill it?


SAM
Apparently, they experimented with that, too. Um – headshot. But, if you don't burn the body within 12 hours, it reanimates again.


DEAN
Nazi bastards.


EXT. LIBRARY – DAY

A black car pulls up outside the library. The DRIVER opens the rear door for a MAN WEARING A RING bearing a design with a sword and four crosses.


INT. LIBRARY – DAY


The MAN WEARING A RING and the DRIVER walk up the stairs.


CUT TO:


The MAN WEARING A RING walks among the shelves. The DRIVER walks up to him and speaks with a German accent.


DRIVER
The security camera's hard drives have all been wiped. Are you sure he's been murdered?


MAN WEARING A RING
[also in a German accent] Torvald was killed here, but not by a man. I'd know more, but his ghost was forced to depart before it could tell me. They knew enough to burn his remains.


The MAN WEARING A RING takes a book from the shelves and finds some clay underneath it.


DRIVER
Blood?


MAN WEARING A RING
Clay. Torvald kills the Initiative's last rabbi, and now the Golem of Vitsyebsk kills him.


INT. AARON’S HOUSE – DAY


DEAN puts a duffel bag down on a table.


DEAN (on phone)
No, no, Garth, not a tool society – "Thule" – T-H-U-L-E. Yeah. All right. Call me if you find anything.


DEAN hangs up. SAM is using the laptop at the table.


DEAN
All of Garth's contacts are stumped. Nobody on the circuit's ever even heard of the Thule Society. [He takes off his jacket.] Whoever these people are, they've been flying beneath the hunter radar. Anything?


SAM
Nothing solid. I mean, the lore is all over the place. Uh, according to one legend, um, it can be shut down if you erase one of the letters off its forehead.


DEAN
I didn't see any letters on Clayface.


SAM
Exactly. So, side-burner that. Another one – [SAM reads from an article about Golem from a website titled “Ancient Lore”] "some have a scroll in their mouth you're supposed to rip out."


DEAN
Wouldn't that give him some sort of a lisp or something?


SAM
Well, classically, they're not even supposed to speak. We do know that he took on an entire camp full of heavily armed German soldiers and Thule necromancers and won.


DEAN
One badass Hummel figurine.


SAM
That we have no idea how to put back in the box.


DEAN
Great.


AARON comes into the room.


AARON
So, that's your plan – taking out my Golem?


SAM
It's not a plan.


DEAN
We would just feel a lot better if we knew how. That's all.


AARON
What makes you think you have any right to make that decision?


DEAN
Believe me, if we need the right, we will take it.


AARON
Look, he may be a pain in the ass, but he's my responsibility.


SAM
Look, the Golem was built to go to war. You're not trained for that. How are you gonna take that on?


AARON
I don't know.


A MAN IN A SUIT kicks in the front door. DEAN grabs AARON and pushes him back. SAM hides the red ledger under a leather bag in the corner. DEAN tries to grab his gun from his duffel bag, but the MAN punches DEAN and sends him flying to the ground. The MAN points a gun at SAM. Another MAN hauls AARON up by his clothing. The GOLEM charges into the room, growling. He overturns a table, grabs one of the MEN, and chokes him.


MAN WEARING A RING
Enough! There you are… [the GOLEM drops the MAN he was choking] you grim piece of work… [the GOLEM turns to face the MAN WEARING A RING] after all these years.


GOLEM
Eckhart.


ECKHART
[holding out a hand towards the GOLEM and speaking in Latin] Subtitle: Clay of Adam, surrender your bond unto me!


The GOLEM stands still and his shoulders sag. ECKHART pats him on the shoulder as he walks past him towards AARON, SAM and DEAN.


ACT FOUR
INT. AARON’S HOUSE – DAY


The MAN pointing a gun at SAM pushes him against a wall. Another MAN points a gun at DEAN, who is still on the floor. SAM slides down the wall to sit on the floor, holding up his hands. ECKHART walks to the GOLEM, who is standing motionless.


ECKHART
I command you by the covenant of your makers – Clay of Adam, surrender your bond onto me!


The GOLEM opens his mouth and a small scroll falls into ECKHART’s hand.


ECKHART
[to AARON] So, you are the Golem's rabbi? [He reads the scroll.] You woke him... but you didn't take possession of him. You write your name on the scroll, boy. That's how you... Yifalchunbee.


AARON
I didn't know what he meant.


DEAN looks at a gun in his jacket, which is just out of reach.


ECKHART
Knowledge is power, isn't it? [He strikes AARON across the face and AARON falls back against the wall.] Now, which of you is going to tell me where I can find a certain red ledger?


One of the MEN looks through a chest in front of the bed.


SAM
How about you screw yourself, Nazi bastard?


ECKHART
Can we... Could we put the Nazi thing aside for the moment and just talk about this like –


DEAN
Nazi necromancer dicks? Pass.


SAM
So I take it you're the commandant? The one that authorized all those experiments?


ECKHART
Invented... those experiments, thank you.


SAM
So, what about you? I mean, you're not... undead. So what did you do? You cast a "forever 21" spell on yourself, like your little friend at the library?


ECKHART
His name was Torvald. And you will suffer for that.


One of the MEN finds the red ledger under the bag in the corner.


DEAN
You know, I got to say, spell or no spell, he broke easy, so...


The MAN hands the red ledger to ECKHART, who flips through it.


ECKHART
I'm sorry. So… Let me tell you what I see. A magic Jew at my feet, not a master in sight, and, finally, [he holds up the ledger] our secrets secret once again. Which reminds me of a story. "A Jew, two gentiles, and a Golem walk into a bar" – and it doesn't end with them coming out.


AARON smashes ECKHART with a table leg from the table the GOLEM broke. SAM dives for the gun in the leather bag and DEAN for the gun in his jacket. They shoot the two MEN who were pointing guns at them. The third MAN drags AARON towards the door, but suddenly drops AARON and runs out the door. ECKHART gets to his feet.


ECKHART
Fools! You can kill me. But you will never kill all the Thule.


SAM and DEAN shoot ECKHART in the head in unison.


DEAN
Well, that's a start. [to AARON] You okay?


AARON
Yeah. Yeah.


The camera focuses on ECKHART’s ring-bearing hand and the scroll, which has dropped to the floor. Blood drips nearby, presumably from ECKHART’s gunshot wounds.


ACT FIVE
INT. AARON’S HOUSE – NIGHT


The GOLEM is still standing near the door with his mouth open. We see light from car headlights through the window and a few moments later AARON, DEAN and SAM enter.


DEAN
Well, now we know – paper beats Golem, fire beats undead Nazi zombie freaks.


SAM
So... What do you say, Aaron? I mean, we got a place we can keep him.


AARON
No. I mean... Eckhart might be dead, but you heard him. The Thule are still out there... hidden, active. [He unwinds the scroll and looks at the last name on it.] That's my grandfather. He left me something important. [He takes a pen out of his pocket.] Something only I can do.


AARON writes his name on the scroll, then rolls it up and places it in the GOLEM’s mouth. The GOLEM breathes deep and straightens his shoulders. He turns to face AARON.


AARON
It looks like I'm the Judah Initiative now.


GOLEM
Yifalchunbee.


AARON
B-but I thought I did.


GOLEM
Yes. [He bows his head to AARON.]


DEAN looks at SAM and AARON looks up at the GOLEM.


EXT. BUNKER – DAY


The IMPALA is parked outside.


INT. BUNKER – DAY


"Sunny Side of the Street" by Frankie Laine plays. SAM takes a card from a drawer and walks towards the table as DEAN comes into the room.


DEAN
What're you doing?


DEAN opens the refrigerator as SAM sits down.


SAM
Ordering – I'm making a, uh, card entry for our, uh, copies from the Thule's red ledger for our collection.


DEAN looks down at the beers in his hand, looks at SAM, and then puts the beers back into the fridge.


♪ Grab you coat and get your hat

♪ Leave your worries on the doorstep


DEAN
So, uh, what? Aaron's a J.I., and... you're a Man of Letters now? Is that it?


♪ Just direct your feet

♪ on the sunny side of the street


DEAN pours scotch from a decanter on one of the bookshelves.


♪ can't you hear that pitter-pat?

♪ that happy tune is yours now


He sets a glass down in front of SAM.


DEAN
Good.


SAM looks up at DEAN.


♪ Life can be oh so sweet

♪ on the sunny side of the street


SAM picks up his glass and sniffs at it. DEAN sits down on the opposite side of the next table and puts his feet up. SAM and DEAN tilt their glasses towards each other and drink. DEAN leans his head back contentedly and SAM goes back to writing.
