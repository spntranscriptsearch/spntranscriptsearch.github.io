[The Lizzie Borden Bed and Breakfast is in Fall River, Massachusetts. The first thing we see is the moon from a window of the B&B. A young girl is looking at herself in a mirror. ]

GIRL

This place is way creepier in person.

BOY

Hell, yeah, it is. Ghostfacers can’t capture the ... rage vibes.

GIRL

You think we’ll see anything?

BOY

You know why I got this room? It’s supposed to get the heavier paranormal action.

[The boy lowers the needle on an antique phonograph (aka record player). Daisy, Daisy starts to play.]

GIRL

And, now we’re in The Shining.

[The lights start to flicker and electricy starts crackling. The lights go out.]

BOY

Oh, crap.

[The boy chuckles and the song keeps playing.]

Daisy, Daisy Planted one day by a glancing heart Planted by Daisy Bell Whether she loves me...

BOY

Ooh. She’s coming to get you.

GIRL

Shut up!

BOY

Don’t worry. I’m here. It’s what we came here for, right?

[The song keeps playing.]

A beautiful Daisy bell Daisy, Daisy Give me your answer do I’m half crazy over the love of you It won’t be a stylish marriage I can’t afford a carriage

[A door slowly creaks open. The boy walks over to the door with his fist ready to punch someone.]

BOY

Huh. The hinges are falling ...

[A dark figure rises behind the girl. The girl looks at his face.]

GIRL

What?

[The boy can only watch as the dark figure swings down with an ax and the girl is dead. The boy gasps then screams repeatedly as he tries to get out of the room. But to no avail. He is struck down by the shadowy figure with the same ax.]

The boys are in the bunker. SAM is sitting at the table as DEAN walks in.]

DEAN

Yo. Don’t suppose you’ve got a 20 on the darkness.

SAM

Uh. Well, I thought I had something earlier. Half a town flipped their gourds and started attacking people. But it turns out they’d eaten rabid possum meat.

DEAN

Okay, they do realize that possum is a giant rat, right?

SAM

It’s a marsupial.

DEAN

Huh?

SAM

Not the point. Check this out.

(SAM turns the laptop around so DEAN can see a web page.)

SAM

Um, a couple was ax murdered in Fall Rivers, Massachusetts at ... wait for it ... the Lizzie Borden Bed and Breakfast museum.

DEAN

A B&B and a museum. Yeah. That doesn’t sound like a tourist trap at all.

SAM

I mean the thing is the inn was Lizzie Borden’s actual house. In 1892 she hacked up her mom and stepdad there. Or allegedly hacked them up. She was acquitted and spent the rest of her days in Fall Rivers hounded and persecuted by the townspeople.

DEAN

So you’re thinking revenge killing.

[SAM shrugs.]

DEAN

Why now? It was probably some psycho fan who’s seen to many slasher flicks.

SAM

Could be, but the inn was locked up. No signs of entry or exit. Half a dozen guests. None of whom saw or heard any intruders.

DEAN

Well, maybe the murderer was actually competent. Wait a minute. I know what this is. This has something to do with your freaky fetish for serial killers.

SAM

It’s not a fetish.

DEAN

You’ve always wanted to see that house!

SAM

Dean, two people are dead. In Lizzie Borden’s home. We got no leads on Amara. I say we check this out.

[SAM closes his laptop and rises.]

SAM

Besides, the entire Borden clan are buried in Fall Rivers. Including Lizzie.

DEAN

What do you want to do about Cas?

SAM

Oh, he’s knee deep binge watching The Wire. Just started Season 2.

DEAN

Oh, he’s not coming out any time soon. All right.

[Baby pulls up to the B&B. SAM and DEAN walk into the museum.]

SAM

So I guess now Lizzie Borden has her own doll.

DEAN

Yeah, went a little overboard on the crazy eyes.

[MASON, the innkeeper, is on the phone.]

MASON

No, it’s absolutely not a crime scene anymore. The room’s been cleaned and you’re not even on the same floor. There’s no reason to cancel!

[The person on other end hangs up. MASON sighs.]

DEAN

People still freaked out about the murders, huh?

MASON

Some find it exciting. Can I help you boys?

SAM

Yeah. We’d read about the tragedy and I’m a bit of a history buff. I just wanted to ask. Do you think the killings had anything to do with Lizzie Borden? I mean her ghost, or whatever?

DEAN

Probably some crazed fan broke in, right?

MASON

These are great questions, guys. Ones we usually answer for our paying guests.

SAM

Right.

[SAM clears his throat as he pulls out his wallet. At that moment, MASON’S mother, MRS. KEMPER, enters the room yelling at MASON.]

MRS. KEMPER

Mason! You forgot to cancel the bakery order!

MASON

Mom! I’m with customers?

MRS. KEMPER

$200 worth of danish and no guests to eat it!

MASON These guys can put away a few.

[SAM nods yes.]

MRS. KEMPER

This is coming out of your paycheck!

[MASON sighs.]

MASON

Of course it is.

DEAN

Whew! Working with family can be tough.

[SAM gives DEAN a funny look.]

MASON

Twenty years. You’ll have your pick of rooms.

SAM

We’ll take the one the couple was in.

MASON

The deceased couple?

DEAN

Uh, huh. We came a long way to see ghosts. We figured there’s the most unrest there.

MASON

Uh, we’re not renting that room right now. Out of respect.

[DEAN hands over some more cash to MASON.]

MASON

But, you gotta get back on that horse some time.

MASON

Lucky. We redid the room.

SAM

Great. And now that we’re paying guests ... Did you hear or see anything unusual that night?

MASON

Not til we heard the screams. I told mom to stay downstairs and I ran up there. Oh, God. Blood.

DEAN

And who was the couple?

MASON

Local kids. Nothing special about the girl. But the guy. He was a descendant of the original Bordens.

SAM

Hm. Thanks.

[SAM and DEAN enter the room where the two local kids were murdered.]

DEAN

I don’t know where to put my eyes. I think I’m gonna to throw up.

SAM

We’re surrounded by doilies. They’re everywhere.

DEAN

Okay, you think the innkeeper might have mentioned this before he ripped us off.

SAM

Well, I guess you’re gonna have to get yourself another room because this was Lizzie’s original room and I’m not giving it up.

DEAN

What are you, four?

[SAM turns on the EMF detector. It starts it’s usual high pitched warble.]

SAM

Look at that. That jives with what people online have been saying about the upstairs. Crying in empty rooms. Footsteps. Buzzing lights.

[The EMF warbling continues then suddenly stops as SAM enters a closet. He stares at it quizzically.)

SAM

Hmm. No secret panels or passageways in the closet.

[DEAN steps out of the bathroom.]

DEAN

Well, the world’s smallest bathroom is clean. What is that smell?

SAM

I think it’s this. It’s like a lavender toilet water.

[SAM squeezes the perfume sprayer.]

DEAN

Bottled toilet water? Why do you keep spraying it?

SAM

I just wanted to see of the squeezy thing worked.

DEAN

Wow.

SAM

I think it was supposed to be a perfume or something.

DEAN

Alright. I think I’m gonna go check the rest of the inn ‘cause now I’ve got grandma all over me. So ...

[DEAN exits room and we see him go down the stairs. SAM leaves the room, too. He is using the EMF detector. Strangely, it stops when he is a few steps away from the door of their room.

SAM walks down hallways of hotel. The EMF detector starts and stops as he walks. But it maxes out at a STAFF ONLY door.

SAM tries the doorknob. It’s locked. He picks it and the door creaks open. It’s dark in the room so SAM turns on his flashlight.]

[DEAN walks into a museum room and looks around at the various artifacts including a framed and mounted ax. He scoffs at the Lizzie Borden house t-shirt. As he is looking at an information brochure the electricity starts crackling and the lights blink.

DEAN moves a chair to stand on it and begins to tap a blinking light bulb. He notices a strange flash of light from a window. After he gets down he looks out of that window. A bright flash blinds him. He bangs on the window.]

DEAN

Hey! Hey!

LEN

Ooh! Ah!

[LEN is startled by DEAN and runs away clumsily with his antique camera and tripod.]

[SAM is in the attic. The EMF warbling continues. He turns it off and pockets the EMF detector so he can grab a large stick he found in the attic. There is the sound of electrical humming. He pulls a cover off of an EMF generator that is making the sound.]

[SAM and DEAN are back in their room.]

SAM

Yeah. No Lizzie in the attic. But, I did find a homemade EMF generator. Turned that beast off and what do you know? No more signal.

DEAN

Shocker. The, uh, flickering lights? Wired to timers buried in the walls.

(DEAN holds up a timer he pulled out of the wall, wires dangling.)

SAM

Come on!

DEAN

Oh, and check out this baby.

[DEAN takes a picture of Lizzie Borden off of the wall.]

DEAN

Eh? Covering up our very own sound system. I, uh, fished this out of the wall.

[DEAN shows SAM a tape recorder and presses play. A crying, moaning sound plays on the tape. SAM scoffs.]

SAM

Crying in empty rooms.

DEAN

And there’s more. Running footsteps. Uh. Creepy whispers you can’t make out. One flushing toilet. Not sure what that’s about. The whole place is a hoax, man. It’s a tourist trap just like I said.

SAM

Yeah. But we still don’t know how that couple got axed. I mean, how did the killer get in and out?

DEAN

I don’t know. Why don’t we Sherlock that over a beer or something and a lobster roll. I got to get out of this doily coffin.

[In the Lizzie Borden house MASON’s mother, MRS. KEMPER, walks around turning off lights and making sure all the outside doors are locked. We see her walk into her bedroom. But as her shadow crosses her bed another shadow attacks her and she struggles.]

MRS. KEMPER

Ah! Oh!

[We can only hear the ax as it kills MRS. KEMPER.]

[DEAN is looking at the body of the victim, MRS. KEMPER. He helps a police officer replace the cover the face of the corpse. DEAN’s face is grim and thoughtful.]

DEAN

Thanks.

SAM

Detective Madsen? Agent Collins.

[MASON is sitting in a chair.]

MASON

You weren’t Feds earlier!

SAM

Well, um. My partner and I were undercover. Investigating the original murders.

MASON

Where the hell were you when my mom was being ... oh.

[MASON begins to cry.]

SAM

I’m so very sorry, Mr. Kemper.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

We’re gonna find the son of bitch who is doing this.

[DEAN uses the EMF detector secretly. There are no readings. It is silent. DEAN scowls and puts it away.]

DETECTIVE MADSEN

He had just finished locking up. No one was inside but him and Mrs. Kemper. Staff went home hours ago.

SAM

And no suspects for the first murders either?

[DETECTIVE MADSEN nods his head no. DEAN introduces himself.]

DEAN

Hi, um, I’m Agent Gabriel. Listen, I saw a guy hanging around earlier snapping some photos and he ran away when I tried to make contact.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

Let me guess. Short. Chunky. Baby faced?

DEAN

Yeah, that’s him.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

Huh. Yeah, that’s Len. Total teddy bear. I went to high school with him. Obsessed with ghosts but harmless.

SAM

Ghosts? Hm. Is that a real issue around here?

DETECTIVE MADSEN

According to the Chamber of Commerce, absolutely.

SAM

All right.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

I’ll send an officer to Len, get a statement from him.

SAM

You know what? You guys got your hands full. We’ll, uh. We’ll drop by.

[DETECTIVE MADSEN nods yes.]

SAM

Thanks.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

You betcha.

[SAM and DEAN are in Baby driving down the road towards LEN’s house.]

DEAN

Well, so far we got squat that says ghost. Or anything remotely us.

SAM

So maybe its not our usual kind of gig? Maybe we’re dealing with a serial killer?

DEAN

Oh. Yeah. You’d love that wouldn’t you?

[SAM’s cell phone rings and he answers it.]

SAM

Agent Collins.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

This is Detective Madsen. There’s been another victim.

SAM

Really.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

Accident in the next county. I’m there now.

SAM

No, thanks for letting us know.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

You’re welcome.

[SAM ends the cell phone call.]

SAM

Another ax vic. This one miles from the B&B.

DEAN

Lizzie left home.

SAM

Apparently.

SAM

All right. I’ll take the crime scene. You take Len.

[SAM enters the Pensky home where the murder took place. We can hear a siren wail in the distance.]

SAM

Who found the body?

POLICE OFFICER

Babysitter was home with the kid. Found the dad in the driveway.

SAM

Geez. Thanks.

SYDNEY

I heard Jeordi’s dad pull up outside and then there was this shout. I went to look and I saw the blood before I saw him. I thought someone had spilled paint.

SAM

And what about before? I mean, did you notice anything out of order? Uh, a sound? Smell? There’s no detail too small.

SYDNEY

No. It was like any other night.

[JEORDI’s mother walks into the scene.)

JEORDI

Mom!

MRS. PENSKY

Jeordi, are you alright?

[JEORDI’s mom looks at SYDNEY.]

MRS. PENSKY

Did he see anything?

SYDNEY

No. He was inside the whole time.

SAM

Ma’am? Agent Collins, with the FBI. I understand this is a terrible time, but, if you could manage, I’d like to ask you a few ...

MRS. PENSKY

You need to get out of my house. That’s what you need to do.

SAM

Of course. Uh, we can do this tomorrow.

MRS. PENSKY

Get out!

[SAM clears his throat and leaves.]

[Meanwhile, in LEN’s mobile home we see DEAN talking to LEN.]

DEAN

Well, I didn’t expect to see her here.

LEN

Well, gotta live your bliss.

DEAN

Heh. Boy, you are a Lizzie Borden ... I don’t think fan covers it.

LEN

That’s superfan. And curator.

DEAN

Hm. And is that what you were doing that night at the B&B? Uh, curating?

LEN

Oh, I - I, uh.

DEAN

Len, it’s best just to go with truth here.

LEN

I was trying to get a picture of Lizzie’s ghost.

DEAN

And is that what I saw you with?

[DEAN points at an antique camera.]

LEN

Yeah. It’s a .... It’s what the victorians used for spirit photography.

DEAN

Uh, huh. And have you captured any Casper’s on that thing?

LEN

Well, I’ve seen Lizzie at her house. She’s this wispy, gray shadow. But she never shows up on film. Maybe I should go high-def.

DEAN

Why not go inside?

LEN

I’m not exactly allowed at the inn anymore. There’s a minor restraining order. And there’s a gag order not to talk about the restraining order. But you’re a Federal agent.

DEAN

Buried the lead there a little, Len. Why don’t you tell me about the restraining order?

LEN

It was Lizzie’s 155th birthday and I couldn’t get Lizzie’s room so I stayed in the basement. For a couple days. Weeks! I wasn’t bothering anybody.

DEAN

So it’s safe to say that you know the inn pretty well. Let me ask you, did anything about tonight strike you as weird?

LEN

Just you banging on the window.

[LEN’s computer beeps and says “You’re chat room is open.”]

LEN

Oh God, no. I’m supposed to lead a live chat about the ax murders in Fall Rivers. I’m not Lizzie CNN.

DEAN

Yeah, I don’t know why anyone would think that.

LEN

I’ll close it down. Be right back.

DEAN

Okay.

[SAM is talking to DETECTIVE MADSEN outside the Pensky house.]

DETECTIVE MADSEN

Four ax murders in two days and no leads. The whole town’s panicking like it’s the purge.

SAM

Yeah, not the whole town. Mrs. Pensky doesn’t seem too broken up over the fact that her husband was butchered in her driveway.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

You saw the body. She’s in shock.

SAM

Still.

DETECTIVE MADSEN

People have freaky ass reactions to loss.

[Back in LEN’s mobile home, DEAN is looking around and notices a drawing of the Mark of Cain on a piece of paper on LEN’s coffee table. He picks it up and shows it to LEN.]

DEAN

Where did you see this?

LEN

Uh, a site about ghosts? The paranormal?

DEAN

Len, you might be the worst liar I’ve ever met. Tell me where you’ve seen this symbol. I’d take you down to the station and ask you there. But then we’d have to involve the local police, your restraining order.

LEN

Okay. Okay, uh ... I was outside Lizzie’s house a couple nights ago trying to catch a picture of her.

[LEN starts telling DEAN the story of how he met AMARA outside the Lizzie Borden house. LEN has his camera and sees a little girl looking in a window.]

LEN

Oh, for a second I thought you were ... Never mind. Are you lost or staying at the inn?

AMARA

I wish I were. I want to see where Lizzie axed her folks.

LEN

Oh, well, uh. You were looking at it. Half of it. That’s where they found Andrew Borden slumped over the couch in the sitting room. I’m sorry. How old are you?

AMARA

Poor Lizzie. I’ve been reading up on her. Her parents sucked.

LEN

I totally agree! Lizzie has been so misunderstood by history. It’s pretty obvious her uncle had the stronger motive and opportunity.

AMARA

Oh, no. Lizzie definitely hacked them. You can see it in her eyes. Serial killer eyes.

[Back in LEN’s mobile home, he continues explaining to DEAN where he saw the MOC symbol.)

LEN

I ditched her quick after that.

DEAN

And you didn’t tell the police.

LEN

“A” Restraining order? “B” what am I supposed to say? I was hanging out talking murder with a little twelve-year-old girl in the middle of the night?

DEAN

Where does the symbol come in?

LEN

She had it on her shoulder. I don’t know if it was a scar or a birthmark.

DEAN

What did this girl look like?

LEN

Um. A girl. Amara. That’s what she said her name was. You know her?

DEAN

You said she was 12?

LEN

Maybe a little younger or older. Who is she?

DEAN

She’s a runaway. Do you know where Amara is now? Is she still in town?

LEN

I don’t know. Why are you looking for her?

DEAN

I’m not at liberty to discuss that.

LEN

You have to tell me. Please. I need to find her!

DEAN

Why?

LEN

You won’t believe me.

[LEN continues his story. He is still standing outside the Lizzie Borden house talking to AMARA.)

LEN

Okay. Well, uh. Enjoy your Lizzie fest. Oh, hey. Uh. No touching. I - I never touched you!

[AMARA puts her hands on LEN’s face and sucks out his soul. He staggers backwards but is still alive.]

[Back in LEN’s trailer, DEAN and LEN are still talking.]

LEN

I don’t know what that girl did to me. But I haven’t been right since. I can’t eat. Or sleep. I don’t dream. And all the things I used to love. My Lizzie blog. The ghost conventions. They leave me cold. I put this whole collection on ebay last night. Now it belongs to some machinist in Ohio.

DEAN

Well, what about superfan, curator living the bliss?

LEN

Just playing the part of what I used to be. You know. Fake it til you make it. Or feel it.

DEAN

So is that what you were doing at the inn tonight? Faking it?

LEN

No. I was looking for Amara. I want her to put me back. I’ve always been odd. And quirky. But I had a life. Friends. And now. I remember how to talk to people. What to say. But I feel like I’m acting. Going through the motions. I’m like a robot puppet man.

[DEAN talking to SAM on a cell phone.]

SAM

Wait? Amara was here? How?

DEAN

Oh, and the real crazy? Apparently she’s like 12.

SAM

What? How’s that even possible?

DEAN

It ain’t Wheaties she’s eating, I can tell you that much.

SAM

Meaning?

DEAN

Len. He ain’t doing so hot. I think Amara sucked out his soul.

SAM

So, Amara’s growing like a radioactive weed?

DEAN

Yeah. By stuffing her face with souls.

SAM

Does that mean she’s getting more power too? And for what?

DEAN

I don’t know. That tsunami’s gonna hit us sooner or later. We’ll deal with what we can deal with. All these spent shells Amara’s leaving behind.

SAM

You don’t think Len’s our Lizzie Borden, do you?

DEAN

No. I talked to his neighbors. And except for me seeing him at the B&B he’s been here all night. So, we can’t kill him because he hasn’t done anything yet.

SAM

Dean, we don’t want to kill him. We want to save people. Remember?

[DEAN snaps his fingers.]

DEAN

Right. The new rules. Why hasn’t he offed anybody? I mean, it took Jenna all of walking downstairs to slit her grandmother’s throat.

SAM

I don’t know. Maybe not everybody that gets their soul sucked out turns into a killer.

DEAN

Or maybe he just hasn’t got around to it yet. All right. Well. I think the best thing is we stick close until we figure out how to help him out. Which starts by you telling him he’s got no soul.

SAM

Me?

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Why do I have to do it?

DEAN

Well, because you’ve been there. You speak the language. He doesn’t even know he’s been hoovered yet.

SAM

Well, yeah. But you have a better relationship with him than I do.

DEAN

Yeah, but you’re better with that whole sensitive verbal massage.

SAM

There is no sensitive way to tell somebody their soul’s been sucked out by a prehistoric tween!

DEAN

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

SAM

And even if Len does believe us, is that supposed to make him feel better?

DEAN

Fine. Probably couldn’t handle the truth right now anyways. He’s a little fragile right now. Okay. Well, great. Looks like we’re babysitting a 30-year old man.

SAM

There may be someone else Amara got to as well.

DEAN

Our hatchet man.

SAM

Yeah. So the murders started right around the time Len saw Amara, right? Well, the wife of the last victim, Donna Pensky, had this bizarre reaction to hearing her husband ... like she couldn’t care less. It was kind of the way I felt the whole time I was soul-less.

DEAN

Oh, yeah. You were one chilly droid.

SAM

Anyways, the detective thinks it’s shock. But I think it may be mom lost her soul and picked up an ax.

[DEAN nods in agreement.]

[SAM rings the doorbell at the Pensky house. DEAN is sitting in Baby with LEN in the back seat. DEAN looks at SAM and SAM shrugs because no one answers the door. So SAM calls SYDNEY, the babysitter, on his cell phone.)

SYDNEY

Hello?

SAM

Sydney. This is Agent Collins. I’m trying to find Mrs. Pensky. Do you have any idea where she might be?

[SAM starts walking back to Baby.]

SYDNEY

Um. No. She, um, didn’t mention anything. Dawn didn’t want me to come over today.

SAM

Sydney. You are a part of a Federal murder investigation. You do not want to hold anything back from us.

SYDNEY

Okay. There might be one place where she might be. Dawn has a friend, Nate. A special friend.

SAM

Yeah, I’m reading your mail.

SYDNEY

Look, I’m not trying to get Dawn in trouble.

SAM

You have an address?

[LEN is babbling endlessly in the backseat of Baby.]

LEN

Kitten videos, chicken and waffles, eucalyptus scent. I don’t care for it anymore. Used to swoon for dark, curly hair. Now, not so much. Do you think I had a stroke? Or maybe it’s a brain tumor. What’s really freaky is all the stuff that used to make my skin crawl now seems ... eh.

[DEAN and SAM pull up to the address given by SYDNEY. After DEAN turns off Baby he silently mouths “Shut up the hell up” silently to SAM as they look at each other and LEN continues babbling.]

LEN

I couldn’t shake a guy’s hand before. God, that wetness. Now I could lick the sweat off a stranger’s ...

DEAN

Okay!

LEN

Yeah. Any body part. I’m serious. I feel weird, man.

SAM

Weird, how?

LEN

Like, something’s hatching inside of me. Something dark. With wings.

[LEN sees DEAN looking at SAM knowingly.]

LEN

What?

DEAN

Nothing.

LEN

But you looked at Sam like you guys know what’s wrong with me!

[DEAN gets out of Baby. He reaches back in to grab one of LEN’s hands then handcuffs him to Baby.]

LEN

Hey!

DEAN

You don’t have a soul. All right? Amara sucked it out.

LEN

Wha?!

SAM

Dean! You wanna be a little more blunt?

LEN

How - how is that even possible?

DEAN

Look. This is just so you don’t get in trouble. All right, we’ll be right back and then we’ll figure out what to do with you.

LEN

Well, how do I get it back? My soul.

SAM

Generally, you don’t.

LEN

Wh - uh.

[LEN sits back in the seat resignedly.]

LEN

It feels good to finally know.

[DEAN and SAM approach MRS. PENSKY’s house. DEAN rings the doorbell and SAM knocks on the door.]

SAM

Hello!

[DEAN looks through a front window. He sees furniture in disarray.]

DEAN

Well, something happened in there.

SAM

The blue car is the mom’s. I saw it last night.

[DEAN picks the lock. They enter the house and with guns drawn split up to search.

DEAN opens the door to the basement. He goes down the stairs. The light does not work. He turns on his flashlight.

He notices something behind a rollaway bed. He knocks it to the side. There are two dead bodies. One is Nate, the man SYDNEY said MRS. PENSKY was having an affair with and the woman is MRS. PENSKY.

DEAN turns around and someone hits him across the face. He’s knocked unconscious.]

[SAM goes through a doorway upstairs. At the end of a hallway he sees a closet door moving. He approaches it slowly while pointing his gun at it. When he is close enough to open the door he does it quickly. He finds JEORDI bound and gagged on the floor of the closet.]

SAM

Jeordi? Hey buddy.

[SAM kneels and helps JEORDI sit upright.]

SAM

You all right? Give me a sec.

[As SAM begins to untie him, JEORDI sees someone behind SAM.]

JORDIE

No!

[SAM turns when JORDIE screams and SYDNEY cocks a shotgun cock behind him. SYDNEY points it directly at SAM.]

[In the basement, DEAN wakes up with blurry vision. He is tied to a chair.]

SYDNEY

Oh, thank God. I thought you were dead. Huh. I can’t believe that I bagged both of you guys.

SAM

Yeah, so it’s Sydney, the killer babysitter. Not the mom. So what’s the story? You gonna hack us up like the others?

SYDNEY

I’m past that. You two are an offering to my new friend.

DEAN

Let me guess. Is your new bestie Amara?

SYDNEY

You know her?

DEAN

Oh, yeah. We’re tight. How’d you two meet?

SYDNEY

A couple of nights ago I got pretty sloshed. This, uh, smug, little trust fund dirt-bag had just dumped me.

[SYDNEY recounts how she met AMARA. SYDNEY is walking through the parking lot of a bar.]

AMARA

Excuse me. Drunk girl? You shouldn’t be driving. You could put your head through a window.

SYDNEY

Uh, where are your parents? They bring you to this dump on a school night? My parents used to do that.

AMARA

I found this place on my own. I like dark places.

SYDNEY

You’re here alone? Okay, let’s uh, let’s get you inside. I’m Sydney, by the way.

AMARA

I’m going to help you Sydney.

SYDNEY

You think I need help? Well, I, maybe you’re right. Tonight, anyway.

[AMARA holds one of SYDNEY’s hands in hers. SYDNEY suddenly smiles and laughs at AMARA’s mere touch.]

SYDNEY

How did - how did you do that? Oh, I feel like ecstasy-orgasm chocolate cake! You’re an angel!

[At the mention she might be an angel AMARA’s face turns angry.]

AMARA

Do I look like a whiney-wing suck up?

SYDNEY

Well, then, what are you?

[AMARA puts her hands on the sides of SYDNEY’s head and sucks out her soul.]

[In the Pensky’s basement.]

SYDNEY

Have you guys ever seen the iced tea commercial? Where the lady is lying along the inflatable raft and she’s just drifting along a sparkling pool? That’s what it was like! Being with Amara. Bliss. No hurting. No sadness. No memories.

SAM

So you don’t want memories?

SYDNEY

Did you have nice parents, Sam? Because my folks treated me and my sister like human ash trays.

[SYDNEY pulls up her shirt to show cigarette burn scars on her stomach.]

SYDNEY

I used to have to drink myself blind to even look at these. Let alone show anybody. And now I don’t know what Amara did to me but it’s just skin.

SAM

Right. Well, that’s really ... Good for you.

SYDNEY

No more waking up screaming from nightmares. No more flashbacks. Amara took away the pain. She lightened something in me.

DEAN

Except now you’re an ax murderer.

SYDNEY

I’m free. Before there was always this constant voice in my head, “You can’t do that. It’s wrong. What if you get caught.” And now it’s quiet. It’s just me and what I want. And when you can do whatever you want you don’t have to get caught. And then you can really fly.

DEAN

Were you flying when you diced up that couple at the inn?

SYDNEY

Oh. When I’d found out that that ... puss-hole was taking another girl to the B&B that’s his deal closing move. I didn’t have to sit at home and cry about it.

DEAN

And what about the innkeeper;s mom?

SYDNEY

That piece of jerky. She screwed me out of two weeks pay. I used to fantasize about killing her and now I’m living the dream.

SAM

So that’s how you got in and out. You worked there.

SYDNEY

Just for one summer.

DEAN

What about Jeordi’s parents? Huh? What? Did they screw you over, too?

SYDNEY

Not me. Jeordi. Where to start. Meth dealing dad. Slut mom. No, I saved Jeordi. And I’m going to take better care of him than they ever did.

DEAN

Well, you said that we were, uh, we were an offering. Well, how do you plan on bringing Amara here? Don’t tell me that girl’s got a cell phone.

SYDNEY

I’ve been praying. And I know that she can hear me. I can feel it. She’s close. She hasn’t left me.

DEAN

Well, bring her on out. We’ve been hunting that bitch for weeks.

[SYDNEY hits DEAN with the butt end of the shotgun.]

SYDNEY

She is a goddess!

[SAM uses the opportunity to suddenly reveal he is loose. He jumps up to attack SYDNEY. She fires the shotgun at SAM but misses. Then she suddenly drops to the floor. LEN is standing behind SYDNEY with a bloody ax.]

LEN

Holy crap. I just did that.

SAM

Hey. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take this away.

[As SYDNEY is laying on the floor of the basement bleeding to death she speaks.]

SYDNEY

The darkness is coming. It’s so peaceful. It’s coming for all of us.

[Outside of the Pensky house SAM walks down the stairs of the front porch to sit beside JEORDI.]

SAM

Jeordi, you have any, uh, family you can stay with?

[JEORDI doesn’t respond.]

SAM

When I was six months old my mom died and my dad was ... was never really around much. I realize that’s not really close to what you’ve lost but you’re gonna survive this. People are gonna help you.

JEORDI

There’s Aunt Kathy. She comes at Christmas.

[SAM nods and sighs.]

[Back in the Pensky house LEN is talking to DEAN. He shows DEAN his bandaged hand.]

LEN

First of all, I ripped my hand out of the cuff.

DEAN

Well, you saved us, Len.

LEN

Yeah, that’s not why I mauled myself. I wanted to see if I could do it. It hurt. Like a mother. But it didn’t wig me out. At all. I picked up my thumb like it was a mini-hot dog.

DEAN

I’m not gonna lie. That’s worrisome.

LEN

And that girl. My brain said I should help you but I didn’t really feel anything. For you or her. What kind of person can murder and feel nothing?

DEAN

Len. Whatever darkness you have inside you, if there is a shred of conscience then there might be hope.

LEN

No. Sam said once your soul is gone you can’t get it back. And I know for sure now if I’m not stopped there will be another kill. I can feel it. Like a bubble rising up.

DEAN

So, what do you want to do?

LEN

You could kill me.

DEAN

No, I can’t. Naw. I don’t want to do that.

LEN

Then there’s only one thing. I’m gonna turn myself in. I’ll confess to all the murders. That way I can’t get out.

DEAN

Huh. Well, there’s not too many soul-less killers that would give themselves up.

LEN

I remember what it was like to do the right thing. So, I’m going through the motions. For as long as I can.

[SAM and DEAN are leaning on Baby and eating some fast food while looking out at a harbor.]

DEAN

Still can’t believe Len turned himself in.

SAM

I mean, it kinda makes sense. You know. People having different reactions to losing their souls. I did. Everyone’s got their own history, right?

DEAN

Len loses his heart. Sydney loses her head. What are we? Looking for the cowardly lion next?

SAM

You know I get like this pit in my stomach any time I think of her. The Darkness. Like we only know the tip of what she is. What she does to people. You know Len was freaked out by her. But Sydney. Sydney couldn’t get enough. The bliss she was talking about, you know? What was it like for you? Did you feel like that with Amara?

DEAN

No. No, I mean it was quiet. Until, uh, she started hatching killers and rallying monsters to raise armies.

SAM

So that’s how we have to find her. Follow the bodies.

DEAN

You got a better idea? We could follow the crazy you’ve been seeing. Look, at the rate Amara’s growing, sucking souls and getting stronger. She may not be that hard to find. Come on.

[SAM and DEAN get into Baby and drive away. Behind them, AMARA sees them drive off as she emerges from the tree line.]

AMARA

Bye, Dean. I’ll see you soon.
