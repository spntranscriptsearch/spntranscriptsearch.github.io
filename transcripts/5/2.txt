NOW
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

BOBBY, wearing a bathrobe and ball cap, sits in a wheelchair and stares out the window. SAM watches him from the doorway. DEAN arrives with a manila envelope in hand.

DEAN
It's been like three days now?

SAM sighs.

DEAN
We got to cheer him up. Maybe I'll give him a backrub.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN
Well, what, then?

SAM
Look...we might have to wrap our heads around the idea that Bobby might not just bounce back this time.

A pause. SAM looks at the envelope, which says "X-RAY".

SAM
What's in the envelope?

DEAN
Went to radiology.

DEAN opens the envelope and pulls out the contents.

DEAN
Got some glamour shots.

DEAN hands SAM the contents of the envelope, a chest X-ray with strange writing on the ribs.

DEAN
Let's just say the doctors are baffled.

SAM examines the writing, which is in Enochian.

SAM
Holy crap.

DEAN
Yeah, well, Cas carved you one, too.

SAM's phone rings. He answers.

SAM
Hello? ...Castiel?

DEAN
Speak of the devil.

SAM
Ah, St. Martin's Hospital. Why? What are you—Cas?

SAM hangs up.

A WOMAN in scrubs and a MAN in a white lab coat rush past with a piece of equipment on a cart.

VOICE ON PA
Dr. Cohen to the ER, stat. Dr. Cohen to the ER, stat.

CASTIEL walks past them and other passersby and stops at DEAN and SAM.

DEAN
Cell phone, Cas? Really? Since when do angels need to reach out and touch someone?

CASTIEL
You're hidden from angels now—all angels. I won't be able to simply—

BOBBY
Enough foreplay.

DEAN, SAM, and CASTIEL look over at him.

BOBBY
Get over here and lay your damn hands on.

No one moves. BOBBY looks over his shoulder.

BOBBY
Get healing. Now.

CASTIEL
I can't.

BOBBY turns his chair to face CASTIEL.

BOBBY
Say again?

CASTIEL walks up to BOBBY.

CASTIEL
I'm cut off from heaven and much of heaven's power. Certain things I can do. Certain things I can't.

BOBBY
You're telling me you lost your mojo just in time to get me stuck in this trap the rest of my life?

CASTIEL
I'm sorry.

BOBBY
Shove it up your ass.

BOBBY turns back to the window. DEAN turns to SAM.

DEAN
At least he's talking now.

BOBBY
I heard that.

CASTIEL comes back to DEAN and SAM.

CASTIEL
I don't have much time. We need to talk.

DEAN
Okay.

CASTIEL
Your plan to kill Lucifer.

DEAN
Yeah. You want to help?

CASTIEL
No. It's foolish. It can't be done.

DEAN
Oh. Thanks for the support.

CASTIEL
But I believe I have the solution. There is someone besides Michael strong enough to take on Lucifer. Strong enough to stop the apocalypse.

SAM
Who's that?

CASTIEL
The one who resurrected me and put you on that airplane. The one who began everything. God.

SAM and DEAN look skeptical.

CASTIEL
I'm gonna find God.

ACT ONE
HOSPITAL
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

"GOOD GOD, Y'ALL!"

DEAN closes the hospital room door and turns back to CASTIEL.

DEAN
God?

CASTIEL
Yes.

DEAN
God.

CASTIEL
Yes! He isn't in heaven. He has to be somewhere.

DEAN
Try New Mexico. I hear he's on a tortilla.

CASTIEL
No, he's not on any flatbread.

DEAN
Listen, Chuckles, even if there is a God, he is either dead—and that's the generous theory—

CASTIEL
He is out there, Dean.

DEAN
—or he's up and kicking and doesn't give a rat's ass about any of us.

CASTIEL glares.

DEAN
I mean, look around you, man. The world is in the toilet. We are literally—

JENSEN ACKLES

DEAN
—at the end of days here, and he's off somewhere drinking booze out of a coconut. All right?

CASTIEL
Enough.

MISHA COLLINS

CASTIEL
This is not a theological issue. It's strategic.

Guest Starring
JIM BEAVER

CASTIEL
With God's help, we can win.

DEAN
It's a pipe dream, Cas.

CASTIEL advances on DEAN.

CASTIEL
I killed two angels this week. My brothers. I'm hunted. I rebelled. And I did it, all of it, for you, and you failed. You and your brother destroyed the world—

SAM looks down.

CASTIEL
—and I lost everything, for nothing. So keep your opinions to yourself.

SAMANTHA FERRIS

BOBBY
You didn't drop in just to tear us a new hole. What is it you want?

CASTIEL
I did come for something. An amulet.

BOBBY
An amulet? What kind?

ALONA TAL

CASTIEL
Very rare. Very powerful.

STEVEN WILLIAMS

CASTIEL
It burns hot in God's presence. It'll help me find him.

SHAWN ROBERTS

SAM
A God EMF?

CASTIEL nods.

TITUS WELLIVER

BOBBY
Well, I don't know what you're talking about. I got nothing like that.

CASTIEL
I know. You don't.

CASTIEL looks at DEAN, then drops his gaze to DEAN's amulet, and back up.

DEAN
What, this?

CASTIEL
May I borrow it?

DEAN
No.

CASTIEL
Dean. Give it to me.

DEAN is silent, realizing CASTIEL is serious, then thinking it over. He takes off the amulet.

DEAN
All right, I guess.

DEAN holds it out, then pulls back when CASTIEL reaches for it.

DEAN
Don't lose it.

CASTIEL takes it.

DEAN
Great. Now I feel naked.

CASTIEL
I'll be in touch.

DEAN nods, then glances at SAM, then back. CASTIEL is gone. SAM sighs.

BOBBY
When you find God, tell him to send legs!

PHONE CONVERSATION
EXT. GAS STATION – DAY

A gun fires. RUFUS is holding the gun. He fires again and hurries backwards to a YOUNG MAN lying on the ground. He drags the YOUNG MAN to relative safety behind a silver minivan.

RUFUS
Your belt, your belt!

The YOUNG MAN pulls his belt off. RUFUS takes it and wraps it around the YOUNG MAN's thigh above a bleeding injury, a makeshift tourniquet, and pulls it tight. The YOUNG MAN yelps.

RUFUS
Hey. Hey! Hold this.

RUFUS pulls out a phone and presses speed dial.

INT. HOSPITAL – DAY alternating with EXT. GAS STATION – DAY

BOBBY's phone rings. BOBBY picks it up.

BOBBY
Hello?

RUFUS
Bobby. Bobby, damn it, can you hear me?

BOBBY
I can't hear you.

When RUFUS is onscreen, he is clearly audible; when BOBBY is onscreen, RUFUS's voice is staticky and fades in and out.

RUFUS
Listen. I'm gonna need a little help here. Seems I'm up to my ass in demons. Whole damn town's infested. Hang on, hang on—

BOBBY
Where are you?

RUFUS
River Pass, Colorado.

BOBBY
Colora—Colorado?

RUFUS
Colorado!

BOBBY
River Pass, Colorado?

RUFUS
River Pass!

BOBBY
Rufus? You there? Ruf—Rufus?

RUFUS
Bobby, it's—

RUFUS looks up and spots two DEMONS coming around the corner of the church, both black-eyed and one carrying an axe. RUFUS stands up, ready to fire.

Gunshots. The call cuts out. BOBBY looks over at SAM and DEAN.

COLORADO
EXT. MOUNTAINS – DAY

The Impala drives past.

EXT. DIRT ROAD – DAY

River Pass, Colorado

The Impala drives up, approaching the camera, which retreats over a bridge. The Impala stops on the bridge just short of the part of the bridge that isn't there. SAM and DEAN get out for a closer look. DEAN kicks a rock over the edge. It looks difficult enough to get a person across with any margin of safety; getting the car across will be impossible.

DEAN
This is the only road in or out.

SAM pulls out his cell phone and holds it up.

SAM
No signal.

DEAN
Rufus was right. Demons got this place locked down.

SAM
Looks like we're hiking in.

DEAN
And the hits just keep on coming.

DEAN and SAM go around the Impala. DEAN opens the trunk.

RIVER PASS
Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit in the Sky" begins to play.

EXT. STREET – DAY

SAM and DEAN walk along the street, carrying guns and bags and scanning the area. The near side of the street has a sporting goods store advertising ammo, rods and reels, and a thirty percent sale for Pioneers Day; the far side is residential. There is no sign of anyone other than SAM and DEAN.

There's another car in the street, this one tan and the right way up. The driver's door is open, the engine is running, and the radio is playing "Spirit in the Sky".

MUSIC
Prepare yourself
You know it's a must

SAM and DEAN approach this car, guns ready. It's empty.

MUSIC
Got to have a friend in Jesus
So you know that when you die

SAM turns the engine off. Silence falls. SAM sighs.

A banner hangs over the street, welcoming folks to the seventy-fifth anniversary of River Pass, Colorado's Pioneer Days, with pictures of Grand Marshall Jerry Wanek and Rodeo Queen Lee Lee Laschuk.

They pause at a gleaming red classic Mustang. SAM loses interest when he sees it's empty; DEAN admires it for a moment and whistles.

Something sparks at the gas station. The YOUNG MAN's blood is still there next to the silver minivan.

The driver's door of a silver four-door stands open. There's a baby stroller next to the door and a great deal of blood in front of and leading away from the door. SAM and DEAN approach, then scan the area again. There's a large hole in the silver four-door's windshield. They move on.

A gun cocks. DEAN whips around, leveling his shotgun; SAM turns. DEAN lowers the gun.

SAM
Ellen?

ELLEN
Hello, boys.

DEAN glances back at SAM. ELLEN lowers her gun and walks closer.

DEAN
Ellen, what the heck's going on here?

ELLEN splashes DEAN in the face with holy water and raises her gun. DEAN closes his eyes for a moment, letting ELLEN see that the water is neither boiling nor burning him.

DEAN
We're us.

ELLEN lowers her gun and walks between SAM and DEAN to the church.

CHURCH
INT. CHURCH – DAY

There's a devil's trap drawn inside the doorway and a line of salt across the threshold. ELLEN, DEAN, and SAM all walk across both with no problems. ELLEN turns back.

ELLEN
Real glad to see you boys.

ELLEN hugs DEAN, then pulls back and slaps him.

ELLEN
The can of whoopass I ought to open on you.

DEAN
Ow!

ELLEN
You can't pick up a phone? What are you, allergic to giving me peace of mind? I got to find out that you're alive from Rufus?

DEAN
Sorry, Ellen.

ELLEN
Yeah, you better be. You better put me on speed dial, kid.

DEAN
Yes, ma'am.

A long pause. ELLEN turns to lead them further inside. DEAN glances back at SAM, and they both follow her down the stairs.

DEAN
What's going on, Ellen?

ELLEN
More than I can handle alone.

SAM
How many demons are there?

ELLEN
Pretty much the whole town, minus the dead people and these guys.

ELLEN stops at a closed door and turns back.

ELLEN
So, this is it, right? End times?

DEAN and SAM glance at each other.

ELLEN
It's got to be.

SAM
Seems like it.

ELLEN knocks on the door.

ELLEN
It's me.

Someone on the far side opens a peephole, then opens the door; this is AUSTIN. Behind him are the PASTOR, an OLDER WOMAN, a YOUNG MAN (not the one from earlier) with his arm around a PREGNANT WOMAN, a SHORT-HAIRED MAN, a LONG-BEARDED MAN, a MAN WITH GLASSES (his name is ROGER), a YOUNG WOMAN, and a SHAGGY-HAIRED MAN; with SAM, DEAN, and ELLEN, a total of thirteen. AUSTIN closes the door and stands next to the full bookshelf, now visibly holding a rifle.

ELLEN
This is Sam and Dean. They're hunters. Here to help.

AUSTIN
You guys hip to this whole demon thing?

DEAN
Yeah. Are you?

ROGER
My wife's eyes turned black. She came at me with a brick. Kind of makes you embrace the paranormal.

ROGER brings his right hand to his chin, contemplating his ring. DEAN turns to ELLEN.

DEAN
All right, catch us up.

ELLEN
I doubt I know much more than you. Rufus called. Said he was in town investigating omens. All of a sudden, the whole town was possessed. Me and Jo were nearby—

DEAN
You're hunting with Jo?

ELLEN
Yeah, for a while now. We got here, and the place—well, the place was like you see it. Couldn't find Rufus, then me and Jo got separated. I was out looking when I found you.

DEAN
Don't worry, we'll find her.

SAM
Either way, these people cannot just sit here.

The PREGNANT WOMAN startles. ROGER plays with his ring.

SAM
We got to get them out now.

ELLEN
No, it's not that easy. I've been trying. We already made a run for it once.

SAM
What happened?

ELLEN
There used to be twenty of us.

SAM and DEAN check the room: excluding the three hunters, ten.

DEAN
Well, there's three of us now—

ELLEN
You don't know what it's like out there. Demons are everywhere. We won't be able to cover everybody.

The PREGNANT WOMAN is particularly nervous.

SAM
What if we get everyone guns?

DEAN
What, are you gonna arm up baby bump over here?

SAM
More salt we can fire at once, more demons we can keep away.

DEAN glances at him, then over at the PASTOR.

DEAN
There's a sporting goods store we passed on Main on the way in. I bet they got guns.

DEAN and SAM drop their bags.

SAM
All right. You stay. We'll go.

ELLEN
What about—

SAM
If Jo and Rufus are out there, we'll bring them back.

AUSTIN opens the door. SAM and DEAN leave.

DEAN
Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Hold on.

DEAN and SAM stop at the foot of the stairs.

DEAN
Why don't I just go?

SAM
What? Alone?

DEAN
Well, yeah. Somebody's got to stay here and start giving them Shotgun 101.

SAM
Yeah. Ellen.

SAM goes to go upstairs. DEAN reaches out to stop him.

DEAN
No no no. It's gonna go a lot faster if you stay and help, okay?

SAM
While you go get guns and salt and look for Jo and Rufus? That's stupid.

DEAN
I can handle it.

SAM pauses, realizing.

SAM
You don't want me going out there.

DEAN
I didn't say that.

SAM
Around demons.

DEAN
I didn't say that.

SAM
Fine, then let's go.

SAM heads up the stairs.

STREET
EXT. STREET – DAY

SAM
I'll get the salt. You get the guns.

DEAN
We'll go together.

SAM
Dean, it's right there. Can we at least do this like professionals?

SAM raises his gun and heads for the Quick-Mart at the corner of St. Olaf and Riverside. DEAN watches him go, then heads in another direction, presumably along one of those streets to Big Louie's Sporting Goods.

QUICK-MART
INT. QUICK-MART – DAY

SAM fills a plastic bag with cans of rock salt. He hears the door chime, pauses, and stands up. Two black-eyed DEMONS have entered, one carrying a baseball bat and the other a backpack. SAM ducks and finds the mirror to watch them. SAM's shotgun is sitting on top of a row of Campbell's cans. He reaches for it and draws the attention of the DEMON collecting bottles of water, who rushes at him. They fight, slamming each other into shelves. The DEMON grabs SAM by the neck.

SAM
Exorcisamus te, omnis immundus—

SAM clubs the DEMON with a can of rock salt. The DEMON knocks it out of his hand. SAM draws Ruby's knife and stabs the DEMON, who dies. SAM looks for the other DEMON, who jumps him from behind. SAM stabs him through the neck. The normal special effects are not present. SAM doesn't notice, being more interested in the blood on the floor and on the blade. He turns the blade, watching the blood flow, and runs his thumb along the blade, collecting a bit of blood, and contemplates that.

The door chimes. SAM ducks and watches the mirror; it's DEAN, setting down bags.

DEAN
Sammy?

SAM sighs in relief and stands. DEAN comes into the aisle and sees the DEMONS dead on the floor and the blood dripping off the knife.

ACT TWO
CHURCH
The SHAGGY-HAIRED MAN and the OLDER WOMAN assemble salt shells. ROGER practices loading a shotgun.

ROGER
Okay, all right.

ELLEN
Roger, hang on a second—

ROGER fumbles and drops the shell.

ROGER
Sorry.

SAM demonstrates loading a shotgun for the YOUNG MAN and the PREGNANT WOMAN.

SAM
—then snap it in.

DEAN sets the butt of a rifle on the table and faces AUSTIN.

DEAN
You know your way around a gun at all?

AUSTIN expertly disassembles the gun.

DEAN
Hm. Where'd you serve?

AUSTIN
Fallujah. Two tours. Got back a little over a year ago. Takes one to know one. Where'd you serve?

DEAN
Hell.

AUSTIN snorts, amused.

AUSTIN
No, seriously.

DEAN
Seriously. Hell.

SAM is sitting by himself in the corner. DEAN notices and comes over.

DEAN
Hey.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN sits down.

DEAN
What's wrong?

SAM looks down.

SAM
It's just...at the store. Those demons were possessing teenagers. I mean, I had to slit some kid's throat.

DEAN
Come on, Sam, you had to.

SAM
I know. I just...it used to be like...

SAM pauses.

SAM
I just wish I could save people like I used to.

DEAN
What, you mean when you were all hopped up on demon blood?

SAM
I didn't say that.

ELLEN
I'll be back.

DEAN and SAM look up; she's standing in front of them.

DEAN
Where you going?

ELLEN
I can't sit here on my ass. My daughter's out there somewhere. I'm not back in half an hour, go. Get these people out of here.

SAM and DEAN stand up.

SAM
No, wait. I'll go with you.

DEAN
Whoa, hold on. Can I talk to you for a second?

DEAN and SAM leave the room; there's a devil's trap and salt line at this door too.

DEAN
You're gonna go out there again?

SAM
Well, crap doesn't hit the fan with coffee breaks.

DEAN
I'll go.

SAM
It's fine. Just stay here, get 'em ready. I'll cover Ellen.

DEAN
Why's it got to be you?

SAM
Oh, that's right, I forgot. You think I'll take one look at a demon and suddenly fall off the wagon, as if, after everything, I haven't learned my lesson.

DEAN
Well, have you?

SAM slams DEAN into the wall. The door is still open; ELLEN looks over.

SAM
If you actually think I—

SAM cuts himself off. A long pause. SAM goes back in the room.

OUTSIDE
EXT. STREET – DAY

The sprinkler is still going. SAM and ELLEN walk past the tan car.

SAM
So where'd you see her last?

ELLEN
Up ahead. So what's up with you and Dean?

SAM looks over, then back.

ELLEN
It was hard not to notice, how different things are between you guys these days.

SAM stays silent.

ELLEN
Lot of bad road there, huh? What happened? Some girl come between you or something?

SAM
Just—stresses of the job. You know how it is. Kind of surprised, you and Jo hunting. Weren't you always saying she couldn't hack the life?

ELLEN
She can't. But if she's gonna do it anyway—

SAM
You want to keep an eye on her.

SAM looks down the street; smoke rises from behind trees.

SAM
Hey.

SAM points.

ELLEN
Is that a chimney going?

SAM
Looks like it. Come on.

SAM and ELLEN approach a house with smoke coming from the chimney. They hide behind another building and peer around the corner; visible inside the house is a black-eyed DEMON.

ELLEN
Guess we found base camp.

SAM
Demons don't get cold. Makes you wonder what they're burning.

SAM starts around the corner. ELLEN is grabbed from behind. SAM whirls and slams his gun into a black-eyed DEMON. Another DEMON pins ELLEN to the wall with another gun.

JO
Don't move, you evil skank!

The DEMON gets SAM's gun and starts whacking him with it. SAM slams him into the wall. The other DEMON lets go of ELLEN to come help. JO presses ELLEN to the wall with her own gun. JO's eyes go black.

ELLEN
Don't you hurt her, don't you—

JO
Give me my mom back, you black-eyed bitch!

ELLEN shoves JO off and slams her with the gun butt.

SAM
Ellen! Run!

SAM cocks the shotgun and is hit from behind and knocked to the ground. ELLEN takes off while JO gets to her feet. SAM stares up at the new attacker. It's RUFUS, black-eyed.

RUFUS
Got you now, you bastard.

ACT THREE
BASE CAMP
INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

A fire burns in a fireplace. Someone is tied to a chair in front of the fireplace; it's SAM, just waking up and yanking at the ropes. RUFUS and JO, both black-eyed, are looking at him; JO is carrying a gallon jug of water.

RUFUS
Uh-uh. No way you're getting out of those. Did you up myself. You're stuck right where I want you, you evil son of a bitch.

RUFUS backhands SAM. JO splashes him in the face with the water, then looks at him, confused. RUFUS grabs SAM's neck, forcing his head back.

SAM
No, wait, wait, wait.

JO puts down the jug and goes around to hold SAM's head back.

SAM
Just, just wait.

RUFUS pours salt on SAM's face and into his mouth.

RUFUS
Exorcisamus te, exorcisamus te, omnis satanica—

SAM
Stop!

RUFUS
—omnis immundum—

SAM
Please!

CHURCH
INT. CHURCH BASEMENT – DAY

DEAN paces. The PASTOR sits at the table with the OLDER WOMAN, the SHORT-HAIRED MAN, and the YOUNG WOMAN. The PREGNANT WOMAN lies on a cot and the YOUNG MAN sits next to her. AUSTIN stands near them.

PASTOR
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He layeth me down in green pastures, and he raiseth me up again. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil.

Someone pounds on the door. Everyone startles. DEAN opens the peephole, moves what's blocking the door, and opens the door. ELLEN comes in, alone.

DEAN
Where's Sam?

ELLEN shakes her head and sits down next to the YOUNG WOMAN, who passes her a bottle of water.

PREGNANT WOMAN
They took him? Demons took him? Oh my god. What if they're in here? The demons?

PASTOR
Could they get in?

DEAN
No.

DEAN grabs a shotgun and heads for the door.

DEAN
Everybody sit tight. I got to—

DEAN stops with his hand on the doorknob and looks back; he grimaces and comes back to the table where a dozen people are depending on him.

DEAN
Okay, we need to get a plan together. Tell me everything.

BASE CAMP
INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

JO continues to hold SAM's head while RUFUS pours salt on him.

SAM
Please! Come on!

RUFUS
—omnis immundus—

Nothing's happening, so RUFUS stops. JO lets go of SAM to go pick up the water jug.

SAM
Look! Something's not right! Do you see that?

JO splashes SAM in the face. SAM spits out a mouthful of water.

SAM
Come on! Stop! Listen to me!

JO is blocking SAM's line of sight to the open door. When JO goes to grab something else, SAM sees ROGER just outside the door. ROGER turns the ring on his right hand. SAM looks around and up: he's sitting directly under an elaborate devil's trap.

SAM
Listen!

JO and RUFUS huddle in the corner.

JO
Why isn't it working?

RUFUS
I don't know.

RUFUS looks over his shoulder at SAM, who is black-eyed.

SAM
Look, listen to me, something's not right!

RUFUS
But he's not as strong as he thinks he is.

SAM
You can see that. Please. Please. Just listen to me.

CHURCH
INT. CHURCH BASEMENT – DAY

DEAN sits at the table with ELLEN.

ELLEN
Dean, one of them's in Jo. We got to get it out without hurting her.

ELLEN snorts.

ELLEN
It called me a bitch.

DEAN
Bruise a little easy, don't you think?

ELLEN
No, that's not what I meant. It called me a black-eyed bitch.

DEAN considers this.

ELLEN
What kind of demons are these? Holy water and salt roll right off. My daughter may be an idiot, but she's not stupid. She wears an anti-possession charm. It's all kind of weird, right?

DEAN
The whole thing's off.

ELLEN
What's your instinct?

DEAN
My instinct? My instinct is to call Bobby and ask for help. Or Sam.

ELLEN
Well, tough. All you got's me, and all I got's you. So let's figure it out.

DEAN
All right.

ELLEN smiles.

DEAN
Do you know why Rufus came to town? Was there a specific omen?

ELLEN
He said something about water. That's all I know.

DEAN
Padré, you know what she's talking about—the water?

DEAN turns to the PASTOR.

PASTOR
The river. Ran polluted all of a sudden.

DEAN
When?

AUSTIN
Last Wednesday. And the demon thing started up the next day.

DEAN
Anything else? Anything.

AUSTIN
Maybe, but it's pretty random.

DEAN
Good. Random's good.

AUSTIN
Shooting star—does that count?

DEAN and ELLEN look at each other.

AUSTIN
Real big. Same night. Wednesday.

DEAN
That definitely counts.

DEAN stands up and goes to the bookshelf. He brings a Bible back to the table and searches through it.

AUSTIN
So, uh, you think that all this comes from outer space?

DEAN
This isn't X-Files, pal.

DEAN finds the passage he wants and reads it aloud.

DEAN
"And there fell a great star from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the river, and the name of the star was Wormwood. And many men died."

PASTOR
Revelation eight ten. Are you saying that this is about the apocalypse?

DEAN
You could say. And these specific omens, they're prelude to what?

PASTOR
The Four Horsemen.

DEAN
And which one rides the red horse?

PASTOR
War.

DEAN
That cherry Mustang parked on Main.

ELLEN nods.

PASTOR
You can't think that a car—

DEAN
It's the way I'd roll. I mean, think about it. It all makes sense. If War is a dude and he's here, maybe he's messing with our heads.

ELLEN
Turning us on each other.

DEAN
You said Jo called you a black-eyed bitch. They think we're demons, we think they're demons. What if there are no demons at all and we're all just killing each other?

PASTOR
Wait, just back up. It's the apocalypse?

DEAN
Sorry, Padré.

The PASTOR blinks several times.

BASE CAMP
INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

SAM is alone in the room, still tied to the chair. ROGER comes in.

SAM
Who the hell are you?

ROGER takes off his glasses.

SAM
What are you?

'ROGER'
You caught me. Popped in to watch. I can hustle like that.

SAM
So, the Roger everyone around here knows, the real Roger?

'ROGER'
Buried in a ditch.

SAM rolls his eyes and nods. 'ROGER' closes the door, moves another chair, and sits down.

SAM
So who are you?

'ROGER'
Here's a hint. I was in Germany. Then in Germany. Then in the Middle East. I was in Darfur when my beeper went off. I'm waiting to hook up with my siblings. I've got three. We're going to have so much fun together.

SAM nods, realizing what DEAN just did: this is one of the Four Horsemen, WAR.

SAM
I know who you are. There aren't any demons in town, are there?

WAR
Nope. Just frightened people ripping each other's throats out. I really haven't had to do too much. Take out a bridge here, lay in a little hallucination there, sit back, pop some corn, watch the show. Frankly, you're really vicious little animals, Sam.

SAM
No. You're doing this.

WAR
Please. Last week, this was Mayberry. Now these people are stabbing each other's children.

SAM
'Cause you made them see demons!

WAR
Honestly, people don't need a reason to kill each other. I mean, you seen the Irish? They're all Irish.

SAM rolls his eyes.

WAR
You think I'm a monster. I'm jello shots at a party. I just remove inhibitions.

SAM
I'm gonna kill you myself.

WAR laughs.

WAR
Oh, that's adorable, considering you're my poster boy.

SAM
What's that supposed to mean?

WAR
You can't stop thinking about it, ever since you saw it dripping off the blade of that knife.

SAM is breathing hard.

SAM
You're wrong.

WAR
Save your protests for your brother. I can see inside your head. And man, it is one-track city in there. Blood, blood, blood. Lust for power. Same as always. You want to be strong again. But not just strong. Stronger than everybody. Good intentions—quick slide to hell, buddy boy. You feel bad now? Wait till you're thigh deep in warm corpses. Because, my friend, I'm just getting started.

WAR stands up and puts his glasses back on.

WAR
Showtime for the meatsuits. Watch this.

WAR twists his ring. Blood flows down his forehead. He kicks over his chair, drops to the floor, and screams. RUFUS kicks the door open, JO right behind him. WAR looks up at them.

WAR
He did it!

SAM
No!

To RUFUS, SAM appears black-eyed.

WAR
He said they're coming! He said they're coming to get us!

SAM
No, stop! Jo, Rufus, he's lying! No!

RUFUS
You shut your mouth!

SAM
Please! Jo! He's lying!

RUFUS backhands SAM.

CHURCH
INT. CHURCH BASEMENT – DAY

AUSTIN
So now you're saying that there are no demons and war is a guy.

DEAN
You believed crazy before.

Someone hammers on the door.

WAR
Open up! It's Roger!

AUSTIN checks the peephole and lets WAR in. He's breathing hard, as if he's been running.

WAR
I saw them, the demons. They know we're trying to leave. They said they're gonna pick us off one by one.

DEAN
Wait wait wait. What?

AUSTIN
I thought you said there were no demons.

DEAN
There's not. Where did you go?

WAR
I thought someone should go out and see what's going on!

DEAN
Where did you see the demons and what did they say exactly?

AUSTIN
We just sit here, we're going to be dead.

DEAN
No, we're not!

WAR
They're gonna kill us unless we kill them first.

DEAN
Hold on. Hold on.

AUSTIN
No, man, we got people to protect. All right, the able-bodied go hunt some demons.

AUSTIN picks up a shotgun and hands it to the YOUNG MAN.

DEAN
Whoa whoa whoa. Slow your roll. This is not a demon thing.

WAR holds up his right hand and twists his ring, then points to DEAN and ELLEN.

WAR
Look at their eyes! They're demons!

DEAN and ELLEN appear black-eyed. The PREGNANT WOMAN gasps. The PASTOR raises a shotgun.

DEAN
Go, go!

ELLEN and DEAN turn and run. AUSTIN blasts the shotgun, hitting the door.

DEAN
Move!

WAR watches, triumphant.

ACT FOUR
CHURCH
INT. CHURCH BASEMENT – DAY

Someone loads salt canisters into a backpack. AUSTIN loads a shotgun.

WAR
Those are real.

AUSTIN
Those two could have been demons the entire time. All this salt and holy water talk—as far as I'm concerned, it's all crap.

WAR
Are you sure?

AUSTIN
It's them or us.

WAR
I think I saw some knives in the kitchen.

AUSTIN
Great. Go.

AUSTIN finishes assembling the gun.

BASE CAMP
INT. FRONT ROOM – DAY

RUFUS ties a wire around the latch on a closed window. JO holds two bombs.

JO
Hey, Rufus.

RUFUS
Yeah.

JO
Pipe bombs won't kill a demon.

RUFUS checks the wire; it's attached to another bomb.

RUFUS
Right. But in my experience, demons come at you slower if they're in a body with no limbs.

RUFUS closes the curtains.

JO
One of them is in my mother.

RUFUS turns to her.

RUFUS
Jo, listen to me. You know I'm gonna do everything I can. Your mom's gonna be okay.

JO nods.

JO
Unless she comes through that window.

RUFUS holds out a hand. JO gives him the next bomb.

FIGHT
EXT. STREET – DAY

The church door opens. AUSTIN comes out, scans the area, and holds the door open.

AUSTIN
All right, let's move.

The YOUNG MAN, the YOUNG WOMAN, and WAR follow AUSTIN. All four are holding shotguns.

INT. ANOTHER ROOM – DAY

JO and RUFUS load shotguns. An explosion; JO and RUFUS duck. They look at each other, then ready guns to go have a look. The FRONT ROOM is devastated and empty. RUFUS peers through the windows. Someone grabs RUFUS and pulls him through the window.

JO
Rufus!

Someone else grabs JO from behind.

EXT. PORCH – DAY

RUFUS comes through the window; DEAN slams him to the ground.

INT. HOUSE – DAY

JO and ELLEN fight. ELLEN appears black-eyed. ELLEN pins JO to the wall.

ELLEN
Now you listen up, Joanna Beth Harvelle.

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

DEAN hauls RUFUS up and slams him against the wall. DEAn appears black-eyed.

DEAN
Listen to me. I'm not a demon. Think, Rufus. All those omens.

RUFUS
You go to hell.

RUFUS kicks DEAN in the crotch, then hits him in the chest and face. RUFUS lunges for his dropped gun and DEAN hauls him away, pushing him back against the wall.

DEAN
Rufus! The polluted water, the shooting star, the red Mustang—it's War. I'm telling you, it's War.

RUFUS
You're damn right it is.

RUFUS punches DEAN in the face and goes for the gun. DEAN tackles him.

DEAN
The Horseman!

RUFUS
Horseman?

DEAN
Yes. He's turning us against each other. You're hallucinating.

RUFUS stares up at DEAN. The black fades from DEAN's eyes.

RUFUS
The Horseman. War.

DEAN
Yes.

RUFUS looks to each side.

RUFUS
Did you figure this out all by yourself, genius?

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

AUSTIN leads the charge to a car. Everyone takes cover behind it.

INT. HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and RUFUS burst inside. ELLEN turns and levels a shotgun.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa!

ELLEN
We all on the same page?

DEAN and RUFUS look at each other and nod.

RUFUS
Good.

DEAN
Hi, Jo.

JO
Hey.

DEAN
Okay, we got to find War before everybody in this town kills each—

Gunshots. Everyone ducks.

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

AUSTIN fires the rifle at the house.

INT. HOUSE – DAY

DEAN
Damn it! Where's Sam?

RUFUS
Upstairs.

ELLEN gives JO the shotgun.

ELLEN
Take this.

DEAN rushes in one direction, ELLEN another.

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

AUSTIN is down behind the car, huddling with the others.

AUSTIN
All right, you three go around back. Take the alley.

INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

SAM is alone. The door opens: it's DEAN.

SAM
Dean. It's not demons.

SAM and DEAN speak in unison.

SAM and DEAN
It's War.

DEAN
I just can't figure out how he's doing it.

DEAN cuts SAM free.

SAM
The ring.

DEAN
The ring. The ring—that's right. He turned it right before he made everybody hallucinate and go hellbitch.

SAM
Right.

DEAN
We got to move. Come on.

EXT. HOUSE – DAY alternating with INT. UPPER ROOM – DAY

AUSTIN exchanges bullets with ANOTHER YOUNG MAN in an upper window of the house. The OLDER WOMAN crosses herself and folds her hands. The SHAGGY-HAIRED MAN hurries along behind a fence. The YOUNG MAN peers around a corner. ANOTHER MAN shoots at him; he pulls back, keeping the PREGNANT WOMAN behind him. The SHAGGY-HAIRED MAN and the OTHER MAN exchange fire.

RUFUS
People, cease fire!

RUFUS is behind the OTHER MAN.

RUFUS
Stop shooting! Stop!

RUFUS takes the gun from the OTHER MAN and slams him in the head with it.

RUFUS
I'm getting too old for this.

The OTHER YOUNG MAN aims out the window at the PASTOR and the YOUNG WOMAN, who run to shelter behind a trailer. The PASTOR comes out and the OTHER YOUNG MAN fires. The bullet goes straight through the PASTOR, who falls.

YOUNG WOMAN
Father!

The YOUNG WOMAN runs out to the PASTOR, sobbing. The OTHER YOUNG MAN fires again and misses, then aims more carefully. ELLEN approaches, pressing something to the PASTOR's wound. The YOUNG WOMAN looks up.

ELLEN
I'm not what you think, honey. Come on, keep this right here.

INT. UPPER ROOM – DAY

RUFUS comes up behind the OTHER YOUNG MAN, taking his gun.

RUFUS
'Stop firing' usually means 'stop firing'.

RUFUS leaves.

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

AUSTIN grabs ELLEN and throws her down, aiming at her face. She appears black-eyed. He pulls the trigger: out of bullets. ELLEN grabs the gun; AUSTIN pulls a knife. Both drop the gun in favor of struggling over the knife.

EXT. STREET – DAY

WAR walks up to the red Mustang. He looks back over his shoulder and sees nothing. He reaches for the door and DEAN and SAM grab him. WAR laughs.

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

AUSTIN and ELLEN are evenly matched.

EXT. STREET – DAY

DEAN holds on to WAR. SAM draws Ruby's knife.

WAR
Whoa. Okay. That's a sweet little knife. But come on. You can't kill war, kiddos.

DEAN
Oh, we know.

SAM slams WAR's right hand against the Mustang and cuts all four fingers off. The ring clinks on the pavement.

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

AUSTIN calms down. ELLEN, who no longer appears black-eyed, eases him off of her.

INT. UPPER ROOM – DAY

The OTHER YOUNG MAN puts his head in his hands.

INT. HOUSE – DAY

RUFUS comes down the stairs and nods at JO.

EXT. STREET – DAY

DEAN leans down and picks up the ring. WAR and the red Mustang are gone; SAM and DEAN look for them.

EPILOGUE
EXT. MOUNTAIN REST AREA – DAY

DEAN and SAM sit at a picnic table. DEAN holds up the ring.

DEAN
So, pit stop at Mount Doom?

SAM is silent, pensive.

SAM
Dean—

DEAN
Sam, let's not.

SAM
No, listen. This is important. I know you don't trust me.

DEAN looks away.

SAM
Just, now I realize something. I don't trust me either.

DEAN looks up.

SAM
From the minute I saw that blood, only thought in my head...and I tell myself it's for the right reasons, my intentions are good, and it, it feels true, you know? But I think, underneath...I just miss the feeling. I know how messed up that sounds, which means I know how messed up I am. Thing is, the problem's not the demon blood, not really. I mean, I, what I did, I can't blame the blood or Ruby or...anything. The problem's me. How far I'll go. There's something in me that...scares the hell out of me, Dean. In the last couple of days, I caught another glimpse...

DEAN
So what are you saying?

SAM
I'm in no shape to be hunting. I need to step back, 'cause I'm dangerous. Maybe it's best we just...go our separate ways.

DEAN considers this.

DEAN
Well, I think you're right.

SAM
I was expecting a fight.

DEAN
The truth is I spend more time worrying about you than about doing the job right. And I just, I can't afford that, you know? Not now.

SAM nods.

SAM
I'm sorry, Dean.

DEAN
I know you are, Sam.

SAM moves to stand up.

DEAN
Hey, do you, uh, wanna take the Impala?

SAM
It's okay.

SAM stands up, takes a few steps, and turns back.

SAM
Take care of yourself, Dean.

DEAN
Yeah, you too, Sammy.

SAM walks to the Impala, grabs his backpack out of the back seat, and walks over to the pickup truck parked nearby. He says something inaudible to the driver and gets in the passenger side. The truck drives off. DEAN watches it go.
