TEASER


Oak Park, Illinois

We pan over a dark suburban neighborhood street and focus in on one nicely kept house.

A man in his thirties, with red hair and a beard, exits the house with a bag of garbage. He takes it out to the garbage cans and stuffs it in. As he walks back to the house, the garbage cans rattle. He stares, walking cautiously towards them. They continue to rattle; he looks up and sees a demonic cloud swirling over the Chicago skyline in the distance.

Panicked, he runs back towards the house, but trips before he gets there. A tendril of demon smoke pours into his mouth.

He opens his eyes; they are black. The now-possessed man stands, looking towards the rest of the demonic cloud now streaming towards Chicago, and smiles.

ACT ONE


SUBTITLE:
One Week Later

Sam is sitting in the Impala in the dark, reading a book with a flashlight. The header at the top of the page reads "Dr. Faustus", and there's information about Crossroads Deals. Sam looks up to see Dean inside the house across from him; he is wearing only an undershirt. Dean grins and gives Sam a double-thumbs up, at which Sam shakes his head, smiling fondly. A Hot Girl comes into frame from off right, and Dean shuts the sheer curtains; they can be seen undressing each other in silhouette. Sam smiles affectionately and is turning back to his book, when his phone rings.

SAM
Hello.

BOBBY
(seen driving along another dark highway in his own beat-up car)

Hey, Sam.

SAM
Hey, Bobby.

BOBBY
Whatcha doing?

SAM
Oh, same old, same old.

BOBBY
You buried in that book again?
(BOBBY pauses. SAM grimaces)
Sam, you want to break Dean free of that demon deal, you ain't gonna find the answer in no book.

SAM
Then where, Bobby?

BOBBY

Kid, I wish I knew. So where's your brother?

SAM
(glancing up to see DEAN frolicking in silhouette through the curtains)
Polling the electorate.

BOBBY
What?

SAM
Never mind.

BOBBY
Well, you boys better pack it up. I think I finally found something.

CUT
Inside the house, SAM is knocking on the bedroom door, and opening it slowly. (Bachman Turner Overdrive's "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet" is the soundtrack.)

SAM
Dean?
(he enters the room)
Dean, you – you conscious? Bobby called, and he thinks that maybe we—
(he stares in horror as feminine moans and DEAN's "whoo-hoo" are heard)
Oh, god.

Later, SAM and DEAN are in the Impala, DEAN driving.

SAM
Let me see your knife.

DEAN
What for?

SAM
So I can gouge my eyes out.

DEAN
It was a beautiful, natural act, Sam.

SAM
It's a part of you I never wanted to see, Dean.

DEAN
(chuckles, slaps SAM on the thigh)
Hey, I appreciate you giving me a little quality time with the Doublemint Twins.

SAM
(quietly)
Yeah, no problem.

DEAN
Really? Well, I got to say, I was expecting a weary sigh or an eye roll, something.

SAM
No, not at all. You deserve to have a little fun.

DEAN
Well, I am in violent agreement with you there.
(chuckles)
What's Bobby got?

SAM
Not much. A crop failure and a cicada swarm outside of Lincoln, Nebraska. Ahh, could be demonic omens –

DEAN
Or could just be a bad crop and a bug problem.

SAM
Yeah, but it's our only lead.

DEAN
Any freaky deaths?

SAM
Nothing Bobby could find – not yet, anyway.

DEAN
It's weird, man. I mean, the night the devil's gate opened, all these weirdo storm clouds were sighted over how many cities?

SAM
Seventeen.

DEAN
Seventeen. You'd think it would be "Apocalypse Now," but it's been five days and bubkis.
(SAM looks at him, confused. DEAN pauses.)
What are the demons waiting for?

SAM
Beats me.

DEAN
It's driving me crazy. I tell you, if it's gonna be war, I wish it would just start already.

SAM
I don't know, man. Be careful what you wish for.


Just Outside Lincoln, Nebraska
The next morning, DEAN and SAM pull up outside a farmhouse. DEAN gets out munching on a sandwich or burger. The air is filled with the sound of cicadas.

SAM
Hear those cicadas?

DEAN
That can't be a good sign.

SAM
No. No, it can't.

BOBBY
(greeting them)
So,we're eating bacon cheeseburgers for breakfast, are we?

DEAN
Well, I sold my soul. Got a year to live. I ain't sweating the cholesterol.

SAM
So, Bobby, what do you think? We got a biblical plague here or what?

BOBBY
Well, let's find out. Looks like the swarm's ground zero.

DEAN
(pounding on the farmhouse door)
Candygram!

No answer but cicadas chirping. Dean picks the lock and opens the door; they cover their noses in disgust.

SAM
That's awful.

DEAN
That so can't be a good sign.

Dean enters first, SAM behind him with a gun drawn. They creep through the house; stopping in the second room, they can hear what sounds like panicked screams.

SAM
You hear that?

They kick open the next door; the sounds turn out to be coming from a television set (playing, apparently, an episode of "Dallas"); a family of three is seated on the couch, several days dead. SAM and DEAN recoil at the increased stench.

SAM
Oh, my god.

BOBBY enters through the other side of the room and also recoils in horror.

SAM
Bobby, what the hell happened here?

BOBBY
I don't know.

DEAN
Check for sulfur.

BOBBY
Yeah.

The three of them investigate the room; DEAN hears a noise out front and whistles quietly, then signals to the others that he's going to go check it out. BOBBY and SAM circle around the other direction.

Out front, DEAN exits cautiously, gun drawn, and looks around. As he comes around the house he is knocked to the ground by a man with a shotgun: ISAAC. His wife, TAMARA, comes up behind him.

BOBBY
(coming up from the other side)
Isaac? Tamara?

TAMARA
Bobby. What the hell are you doing here?

BOBBY
I could ask the same.

ISAAC
Heya, Bobby.

DEAN
(raising an arm pitifully from the ground and waving for attention)
Hello. Bleeding here.

INT. ISAAC AND TAMARA'S PLACE

DEAN
(on the phone, off-camera)
Jenny! That is a beautiful name. That's my sister's name, actually.
(continues)

ISAAC
Honey? Where's the Palo Santo?

TAMARA
Well, where'd you leave it?

ISAAC
I don't know, dear. That's why I'm asking.

SAM
Palo Santo?

TAMARA
It's holy wood, from Peru. It's toxic to demons like holy water. Keeps the bastards nailed down while you're exorcising them.

She digs in a bag and pulls out a large, pointed stake. She hands it to Isaac with an affectionate smile.

ISAAC
Thank you, dear.

TAMARA
You'd lose your head if it wasn't for me.

SAM
So, how long you two been married?

TAMARA
Eight years this past June.

ISAAC
The family that slays together...

SAM
Right. I'm with you there. So, how'd you get started?
(awkward silence as TAMARA and ISAAC look at each other, with hard memories)
I, uh, you know... I'm sorry. It's not – that's none of my business.

TAMARA
No, no. It's – it's all right.

DEAN
(finishing up on the phone)
Well, Jenny, if you look as pretty as you sound, I'd love to have an ... "appletini'.
(making a face at the others at the word "appletini")
Yeah. Call you.
(he hangs up and addresses the group)
That was the coroner's tech.

SAM
And?

DEAN
Get this – that whole family, cause of death? Dehydration and starvation. There's no signs of restraint, no violence, no struggle. They just sat down and never got up.

BOBBY
But there was a fully stocked kitchen just yards away.

SAM
Right. What is this, a demon attack?

BOBBY
If it is, it's not like anything I ever saw, and I've seen plenty.

DEAN
Well, what now? What should we do?

ISAAC
Uh, "we're" not gonna do anything.

SAM
What do you mean?

ISAAC
You guys seem nice enough, but, this ain't "Scooby-Doo," and we don't play well with others.

SAM
Well, I think we'd cover a lot more ground if we all worked together.

ISAAC
No offense, but we're not teaming with the damn fools who let the Devil's Gate get opened in the first place.

DEAN
No offense?

TAMARA
(admonishing)
Isaac. Like you've never made a mistake.

ISAAC
Oh yeah, yeah. Locked my keys in the car, turned my laundry pink. Never brought on the end of the world, though.

DEAN
(chuckles) All right. That's enough.

SAM
(quietly)
Guys, this isn't helping. Dean—

ISAAC
Look, there are couple hundred more demons out there now. We don't know where they are, when they'll strike. There ain't enough hunters in the world to handle something like this. You brought war down on us – on all of us.

TAMARA
(pulling ISAAC away)
Okay. that's quite enough testosterone for now.

TAMARA and ISAAC leave the room.





Later, at nighttime, BOBBY looks out the window, then shuts the curtains. Out of the darkness beyond the house, a mysterious young woman, with long blonde hair, steps out into the light. She stares at the house, calculatingly. (We learn much, much later, that this is RUBY.



INT. SHOP - DAY

The REDHEADED MAN from the TEASER walks into a clothing shop. He approaches a blonde woman.

REDHEADED MAN
Excuse me.

BLONDE WOMAN
Yes?

RHM
(he places a hand on her shoulder and nods towards a shoe display across the room)
Those are... nice shoes.

BLONDE
(looking)
Oh, yeah. They are nice.

She approaches the display, where a brunette woman is looking at a pair of green pumps. She stares at them covetously.

BLONDE
Those are nice shoes.

BRUNETTE WOMAN
Aren't they?

BLONDE
I want them.

BRUNETTE
Sorry. Last pair.

She takes them and goes to the register; BLONDE WOMAN stares after her intensely.

EXT. STORE - DAY
The BLONDE WOMAN follows the BRUNETTE WOMAN, who is now carrying a shopping bag, out to her car.

BLONDE WOMAN
Excuse me. I want those shoes.

BRUNETTE WOMAN
What, are you crazy? No.

BLONDE WOMAN attacks, and grabs the BRUNETTE WOMAN.

BRUNETTE WOMAN
What – what the – ?

The BLONDE WOMAN viciously slams the BRUNETTE WOMAN's head into the windshield of her car. She cracks open her head and blood gushes out of her eye socket, staining the window. The BLONDE WOMAN takes the shopping bag and walks off, unconcerned.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO


EXT. STORE - DAY

POLICEMEN are taking forensic evidence at the murder scene as SAM watches. He goes into the store.


INT. STORE - DAY

DEAN is chatting up a witness, a young blonde woman; he rests a hand on her shoulder..

DEAN
What happened outside makes you realize how fragile life really is. You got to make every second count.

She nods.

SAM approaches, clearing his throat.

DEAN
Excuse me a minute, would you?

WITNESS
(leaving)
Sure.

SAM
Dean, what are you doing?

DEAN
I'm comforting the bereaved. What are you doing?

SAM
Workin'. Dead body, possible demon attack – that kind of stuff.

DEAN
(coughing pathetically)
Sam, I'm sorry. It's just, I don't have much time left, and, uh ... (more theatrical coughing) got to make every second count.

SAM
(chastened)
Yeah, right. Sorry.

DEAN
Apology accepted.

BOBBY enters - in a suit. His hair is slicked back. DEAN and SAM look at him, impressed.

DEAN
Whoa.
(whistles)
Looking spiffy, Bobby. What were you, a G-man?

BOBBY
Attorney for the D.A.'s office. I just spoke to the suspect.

SAM
Yeah? So, what do you think? Is she possessed or what?

BOBBY
Don't think so. There's none of the usual signs – no blackouts, no loss of control. Totally lucid. Just, she really wanted those shoes. Spilled a glass of holy water on her just to be sure; nothing.

DEAN
Maybe she's just some random whack job.

BOBBY
If it had been an isolated incident, maybe, but first the family, now this? I believe in a lot of things. Coincidence ain't one of them. Did you boys find anything around here?

SAM
No sulfur, nothing.

DEAN
Well, maybe something.
(he nods to a security camera in the ceiling)
See? I'm working.


INT. SECURITY ROOM

SAM is seated, watching the security footage, as BOBBY and DEAN hover.

DEAN
Anything interesting?

SAM
I don't know yet. Might just be a guy...
(they watch the REDHEADED MAN approach the BLONDE WOMAN)
Or it might be our guy.


EXT. STORE - DAY

SAM leaves and walks up the street, hands in his pockets. RUBY (the mysterious young woman who had earlier watched the house) slips onto the street several paces behind him and follows. SAM senses that he's being followed, stops, and turns. But she's gone, and he sees nothing out of the ordinary.


EXT. BAR - NIGHT

DEAN and BOBBY are staking out a bar, sitting in BOBBY'S car.

BOBBY (yawning)
What time is it?

DEAN
Seven past midnight.

BOBBY
You sure this is the right place?

DEAN
No. But I spent all day canvassing this stupid town with this guy's stupid mug, and, supposedly, he drinks at this ... stupid bar.

There is a loud pounding on the window; BOBBY and DEAN both jump. It is SAM, who grins at their discomfort and slips into the back seat.

DEAN
That's not funny!

SAM
Yeah. Uh, all right, so – so, John Doe's name is Walter Rosen. He's from Oak Park, just west of Chicago. Went missing about a week ago.

DEAN
The night the Devil's Gate opened?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
So you think he's possessed?

SAM
Well, it's a good bet. So, what, he just walks up to someone,touches them, and they go stark raving psycho?

BOBBY
Those demons that got out at the gate – they're gonna do all kinds of things we haven't seen.

SAM
You mean the demons we let out.

DEAN
(seeing something)
Guys.

REDHEADED MAN gets out of his car and walks towards the bar.

DEAN
All right. Showtime.

BOBBY
Wait a minute.

DEAN
What?

BOBBY
What'd I just say? We don't know what to expect out of this guy. We should tail him till we know for sure.

DEAN
Oh, so he kills someone and we just sit here with our junk in our hands?

BOBBY
We're no good dead! And we're not gonna make a move until we know what the score is.

SAM
Hey, Bobby? I don't think that's an option.

BOBBY
Why not?

SAM nods, indicating another car that has just entered the lot: ISAAC and TAMARA are heading towards the bar.

BOBBY
Damn it!


INT BAR - NIGHT

A woman puts a song on the jukebox; the bartender slides a beer towards REDHEADED MAN, who is sitting at the bar. At a table, a waitress sets down drinks for ISAAC and TAMARA.

ISAAC
Thanks a lot.

WAITRESS
You're welcome.

ISAAC pulls out a flask of holy water; TAMARA eyes him. REDHEADED MAN walks past them towards the bathroom.

ISAAC
Pull the car in back. We'll be right out.

TAMARA
I love you.

ISAAC
I know.

As ISAAC heads towards the bathroom, the BARTENDER grabs his arm and stops him. TAMARA stands up alertly.

BARTENDER
What do you think you're doing?

ISAAC
I'm just hitting the head.

BARTENDER
No.
(He grabs the flask of holy water and tosses it aside)
I mean, what do you think you're doing here?
(His eyes flash black; TAMARA stands behind ISAAC and they both recoil in fear)
I don't like hunters in my bar.

The hunters turn to see the WAITRESS stalking towards them, and see that the rest of the employees and patrons have turned towards them. REDHEADED MAN walks back out of the bathroom. He and everyone else in the bar close in around them; all have black demon-eyes.

There is a loud pounding on the door and everyone turns towards it.


EXT. BAR - NIGHT

BOBBY and DEAN slam themselves against the door, trying to force it open.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

REDHEADED MAN
Man, you really walked into the wrong place.


END ACT TWO

ACT THREE


INT. BAR - NIGHT

WAITRESS
Hold on. I like the girl.

REDHEADED MAN
Wish I had me a girl like that.

WAITRESS
I can think of about a thousand things I'd like to do to her.

ISAAC
You're not gonna lay one filthy finger on her!

PLAID-SHIRT-GUY
(approaching ISAAC)
I got something for you.
(he lifts a large bottle of drain cleaner)
Here. Have a drink on me, hmm?

TAMARA
(panicked)
Isaac?

REDHEADED MAN
On the house!

TAMARA
(restrained by the WAITRESS)
Isaac!

ISAAC takes the bottle and begins pouring its contents down his throat, as TAMARA screams in the background and the demons cackle wildly.

TAMARA
Isaac, no! Baby, please!

ISAAC drains the bottle, shaking, and drops it to the floor. He gags in agony, foamy liquid and blood bubbling out through his mouth. He chokes and collapses to the floor, dead.

REDHEADED MAN
Oh, he's down!
(to TAMARA)
All right, honey. Your turn!

With a screech of tires, BOBBY'S car bursts through the front door of the bar. DEAN, SAM, and BOBBY get out, armed with holy water, which they fling violently into the crowd of demons. They back up and SAM grabs TAMARA, who is still screaming frantically for ISAAC.

SAM
Come on, we got to go! He's dead! Get in the car!
(seeing DEAN still immersed in the fight)
Dean, come on!
DEAN! COME ON!

DEAN has entered combat with the REDHEADED MAN; he opens the trunk just as he runs out of holy water; REDHEADED MAN grins. DEAN overpowers him and stuffs him in the trunk, which is inscribed with a DEVIL'S TRAP. RHM screams. DEAN tumbles into the front seat of the car.

DEAN
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

They drive back out. The demons stare after them, black-eyed and panting.


INT. ISAAC AND TAMARA'S - NIGHT

RHM is tied to a chair under a DEVIL'S TRAP on the ceiling; in the next room, an argument is ongoing.

TAMARA
... And I say we're going back – now!

SAM
Just hold on a second!

TAMARA
I left my husband bloody on the floor!

SAM
Okay, I understand that, but we can't go back.

TAMARA
Fine. Then you stay. But I'm heading back to that bar.

DEAN
I'll go with her.

SAM
It's suicide, Dean!

DEAN
So what? I'm dead already!

SAM
How you gonna kill 'em? Can't shoot 'em. You can't stab 'em. They're not just gonna wait in line to get exorcised!

TAMARA
I don't care!

SAM
We don't even know how many of them there are!

BOBBY
(entering)
Yeah, we do. There's seven. Do you have any idea who we're up against?

DEAN
No. Who?

BOBBY
The seven deadly sins, live and in the flesh!

DEAN
(pauses, grins)
"What's in the box?!"
(awkward silence)
Brad Pitt? "Se7en"? No?
(Bobby tosses him a book)
What's this?

BOBBY
"Binsfeld's Classification of Demons." In 1589, Binsfeld ID'd the seven sins – not just as human vices but as actual devils.

SAM
The family – they were touched by Sloth. And the shopper...

BOBBY
That's Envy's doing – the customer we got in the next room. I couldn't suss it out at first, until Isaac. He was touched with an awful Gluttony.

TAMARA
I don't give a rat's ass if they're the Three Stooges or the Four Tops! I'm gonna slaughter every last one of them!

BOBBY
We already did it your way. You burst in there half-cocked and look what happened! These demons haven't been topside in half a millennium! We're talking medieval, Dark Ages! We've never faced anything close to this! So we are gonna take a breath...
(shouting)
And figure out what our next move is!

TAMARA and BOBBY stare at each other.
BOBBY
(quietly)
I am sorry for your loss.

TAMARA, emotional, walks out of the room.

DEAN and SAM look at each other.



INT. DEMON-HOLDING ROOM

ENVY
(chuckling)
So you know who I am, huh?

BOBBY
We do. We're not impressed.

(No response)

SAM
Why are you here? What are you after?

DEAN
He asked you a question. What do you want?

ENVY chuckles condescendingly; DEAN opens a flask of holy water and splashes him.

ENVY
Ya! Ahh! Ungh .... We already have ... (panting) what we want.

DEAN
What's that?

ENVY
We're out. We're free. Thanks to you, my kind are everywhere. I am legion, for we are many. (chuckles) So me, I'm just celebrating. Having a little fun.

SAM
Fun?

ENVY
Yeah. Fun. See, some people crochet. Others golf. Me? I like to see people's insides ... on their outside.

TAMARA
I'm gonna put you down like a dog.

ENVY
Please.
(laughs)
You really think you're better than me.
(laughs)
Which one of you can cast the first stone, huh? What about you, Dean? You're practically a, a walking billboard of gluttony and lust. (DEAN nods, in acknowledgement.) And Tamara. All that wrath. Oohh. (tongue clicks, tsk,tsk,tsk.) It's the reason you and Isaac became hunters in the first place, isn't it? It's so much easier to ... drink in the rage than to face what really happened all those years ago.

Face twisted in anger, TAMARA smacks him, hard, twice, until DEAN and BOBBY pull her back.

ENVY
Aah! Whew!
(laughs)
My point exactly. And you call us sins. We're not sins, man. We are natural human instinct. And you can repress and deny us all you want, but the truth is, you are just animals. Horny... greedy... hungry... violent animals. And you know what? You'll be slaughtered like animals, too.
(pause)
The others – they're coming for me.

DEAN
Maybe. But they're not gonna find you... 'cause you'll be in hell.
(RHD looks taken aback.)
Someone send this clown packing.

TAMARA
My pleasure.
(begins reading)
Exorcizamus te,
Omnis immundus spiritus,
omnis satanica...

As she continues, the others leave and ENVY screams.


INT. NEXT ROOM

BOBBY
I don't think we're gonna have to worry about hunting them.

SAM
What does that mean?

BOBBY
I think maybe this joker's right. They're gonna be hunting us. And they're not gonna quit easy.

DEAN
You guys, why don't you take Tamara and head for the hills? I'll stay back, slow them down, buy you a little time.

SAM
You're insane, Dean. Just forget about it, okay?

BOBBY
Sam's right.

DEAN
There's six of them, guys. We're outmanned, we're outgunned. We'll be dead by dawn.

BOBBY
Maybe, but ... there's no place to run that they won't find us.

SAM
Look, if we're going down, we're going down together, all right?

DEAN
Well let's not make it easy for them.

From the other room, ENVY gives a final scream; the house shakes and a gust blows out the candles. TAMARA slams the book shut and comes into the other room.

TAMARA
Demon's out of the guy.

SAM
And the guy?

TAMARA
(coldly)
He didn't make it.


LATER,

DEAN is seated on the floor with a row of candles behind him, loading a shotgun. SAM is across the room filling flasks with holy water. He looks over at DEAN, who is looking back at him. They watch each other silently for a moment until the lights begin to flicker. They look around. An old radio sparks to life, playing the beginnings of a scratchy recording of "We Shall Not Be Moved".

DEAN
(cocking the shotgun and standing)
Here we go.

MUSIC:
"I shall be, I shall not be moved.
I shall be, I shall not be moved.
Like a tree that's planted by the water,
I shall not be moved.
I shall be, I shall not be moved.
Like a tree that's planted by the water,
I shall not be moved."

The music plays faintly until ...

OUTSIDE, a demon in ISAAC'S body approaches.

!ISAAC
Tamara! Tamara! Tamara! Tamara! Help me! Pleeeeeeease!

Anguished, she looks back at BOBBY, and out the window again.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

!ISAAC
Tamara! I got away, but I'm hurt bad! I need help!

BOBBY
(to Tamara)
It's not him. It's one of those demons. It's possessing his corpse.

!ISAAC pounds on the door.

!ISAAC
Baby! Why won't you let me in? You left me behind back there. How could you do that? We swore ... At that lake in Michigan. Remember? We swore we would never leave each other!

TAMARA
(sobbing, turning to the others)
How did he know that?

BOBBY
Steady, Tamara. Steady, Tamara, steady, steady....

!ISAAC
You just gonna leave me out here? You just gonna let me die?! I guess that's what you do, dear! Like that night those things came to our house... came ... for our daughter! You just let her die, too.

TAMARA (screaming)
You son of a bitch!

BOBBY
Tamara, no!

She pushes the door open, breaking the salt line, and tackles !Isaac down the steps. She lands on top of him and raises the Palo Santo stake.

TAMARA
You're not Isaac!

She plunges the wood deep into his chest; it sizzles, and he screams.

The other six demons cross the broken salt line and enter the house. One, an overweight balding guy, corners Bobby, who backs up slowly. He stalks Bobby confidently, smiling, until he stops as if he's run into an invisible wall. He looks around, confused. He is under another ceiling-devil's-trap. He looks at Bobby, pleading. Bobby smiles.

BOBBY
Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son.

In another hallway, DEAN is cornered by the waitress (LUST). They fight; she advances on him.

Meanwhile, BOBBY begins reading the exorcism for SLOTH, the demon he has trapped.

BOBBY
Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica...

SLOTH screams.

DEAN is backed into the bathroom.

DEAN
I suppose you're Lust.

LUST
Baby, I'm whatever you want me to be.

DEAN
Yeah, all right, just stay back.

LUST
Or what?

DEAN
Good point.

LUST
I'm not gonna hurt you – not yet. Not unless you want me to.

She runs a hand along his shoulder; he looks down at her, then falls into her embrace. They kiss passionately.

Upstairs, a demon kicks a door in clear across the room. SAM looks around as the demon - a young man in a business suit - enters.

BUSINESS SUITED DEMON
Here's Johnny!

He advances confidently as SAM backs up; then stops, holding up a hand to hold back the two demons flanking him. He looks up to the devil's trap on the ceiling and smirks.

BSD
Come on. You really think something like that is gonna fool someone like me? I mean, me?

SAM
Let me guess – you're Pride.

PRIDE grins and gestures to the ceiling. A long splitting crack appears, destroying the symbol.

PRIDE
Hmm. The root of all sin. And you ... are Sam Winchester. That's right, I've heard of you. We've all heard of you. The prodigy. The boy king. Looking at you now, I got to tell you – don't believe the hype. You think i'm gonna bow to a cut-rate, piss-poor human like you? I have my pride, after all. And now with your yellow-eyed friend dead, I guess I don't really have to do a damn thing, now do I? (SAM looks nervous.)You're fair game now, boy, and it's open season.

MEANWHILE, in the bathroom, DEAN is backing up, still kissing LUST, backing up until he hits a shower curtain. In one move he flips them around, pulls open the shower curtain, and plunges her face-first into the bathtub. It is filled with holy water; she screams in agony.

UPSTAIRS, PRIDE knocks SAM to the ground, then pulls him up with an arm wrapped around his throat and begins strangling him. The mysterious young woman (remember her? She whose name might be RUBY?) appears, a knife strapped to her right thigh. She pulls the knife out, grits her teeth, and slashes the throat of the first demon (GLUTTONY). Fiery light appears in the cut, and he goes down - dead.

GREED (a demon in a woman's body) turns towards RUBY and says in recognition:
You!

RUBY turns to the SECOND DEMON, GREED, who punches her twice; RUBY is knocked away, then rushes towards GREED and plunges the knife into GREED's chest, pulling upwards towards her chain. GREED also goes down. PRIDE lets SAM go to tackle RUBY; SAM pulls him away and punches him in the face, putting him right into the path of RUBY's knife. She plunges it into his neck and upward into his mouth (through his neck); he gargles, opening his mouth and showing the knife in it; and then collapses in a shower of sparks and demonic energy.

SAM (panting)
Who the hell are you?

RUBY
I'm the girl that just saved your ass.

SAM
Well, I just saved yours, too.

RUBY
(chuckles)
See you around, Sam.

SAM
Wait!

He goes into the hall to follow her, but she is already gone.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

The next morning, SAM and DEAN pile the corpses of the demons that didn't survive into a shallow pit and begin pouring salt and fuel over them. Several yards away, TAMARA is standing in front of a funderal pyre: ISAAC'S.

SAM
Think she's gonna be all right?

DEAN
No. Definitely not.

BOBBY comes out of the house, looking exhausted.

DEAN
Well, you look like hell warmed over.

BOBBY
You try exorcising all night and see how you feel.

SAM
Any survivors, Bobby?

BOBBY
Well, the pretty girl and the heavy guy, they'll make it. Lifetime of therapy bills ahead, but, still...

DEAN
That's more than you can say for these poor bastards.

SAM
Bobby, that knife – what kind of blade can kill a demon?

BOBBY
Yesterday, I would have said there was no such thing.

DEAN
I'm just gonna ask it again – who was that masked chick? Actually, the more troubling question would be, how come a girl can fight better than you?

SAM
(chuckles) Three demons, Dean. At once.

DEAN (slapping SAM on his shoulder)
Hey, whatever it takes to get you through the night, pal.

SAM
Yeah, well, if you want a troubling question, I got one for you.

DEAN
What's that?

SAM
If we let out the seven deadly sins, what else did we let out?

(pause)

DEAN
You're right. That is troubling.

DEAN lights a matchbook and tosses it onto the pyre.

LATER, the bonfires have settled down and they prepare to leave.

TAMARA
See you gents around.

BOBBY
Tamara? (she stops to hear him)
The world just got a lot scarier. Be careful.

TAMARA
You too.

She gets in her car and takes off.

BOBBY
Keep your eyes peeled for omens. I'll do the same.

DEAN
You got it.

SAM
Wait, Bobby. We can win this war. Right?

BOBBY
(after a pause, not answering the question, during which they all look uncomfortable and worried)
Catch you on the next one.

DEAN
So, where to?

SAM
Uh, I don't know. I was thinking Louisiana maybe.

DEAN
Little early for Mardi Gras, isn't it?

SAM
Yeah. Listen, I was talking to Tamara, and she mentioned this hoodoo priestess outside of Shreveport that might be able to help us out. You know, with your – with your demon deal.

DEAN
Nah.

SAM
"Nah"? What does that mean,"nah"?

DEAN
Sam, no hoodoo spell's gonna break this deal, all right? It's a goose chase.

SAM
Yeah, but we don't know that, Dean—

DEAN (cutting him off)
Yes, we do. Forget it. She can't help.

SAM (trying to cut in)
Look, it's worth—

DEAN (speaking over SAM)
We're not going, and that's that. What about Reno, huh?

DEAN smacks SAM on the arm lightly and turns to walk away.
SAM grabs his sleeve and turns DEAN back to face him.

SAM
You know what? I've had it. I've been bending over backwards trying to be nice to you, and ... (shrugs) ... I don't care anymore.

DEAN
That didn't last long.

SAM
Yeah, well, you know what? I've been busting my ass trying to keep you alive, Dean, and you act like you couldn't care less. What, you got some kind of death wish or something?

DEAN
No, it's not like that.

SAM
Then what's it like, Dean?

DEAN
Sam—

SAM
Please, tell me.

DEAN
We trap the crossroads demon, trick it, try to welch our way out of the deal in any way? (close on SAM's face, who looks stunned) You die. Okay? You die. Those are the terms. There's no way out of it. If you try to find a way, so help me god, I'm gonna stop you.

SAM
(sighs)
How could you make that deal, Dean?

DEAN
'Cause I couldn't live with you dead. Couldn't do it.

SAM
So, what, now I live and you die?

DEAN
That's the general idea, yeah.

DEAN
SAM
Yeah, well, you're a hypocrite, Dean. How did you feel when Dad sold his soul for you? 'Cause I was there. I remember. You were twisted, and broken. And now you go and do the same thing. To me. (pause) What you did was selfish.

DEAN
Yeah, you're right. It was selfish. But I'm okay with that.

SAM
I'm not.

DEAN
Tough. After everything I've done for this family, I think I'm entitled. (pause) Truth is, I'm tired, Sam. I don't know, it's like there's a, a light at the end of the tunnel.

SAM
It's hellfire, Dean.

DEAN
Whatever. You're alive, I feel good – for the first time in a long time. I got a year to live, Sam. I'd like to make the most of it. So what do you say we kill some evil sons of bitches and we raise a little hell, huh?

DEAN smiles and nods to SAM and walks on to the car.

SAM
You're unbelievable.

DEAN (pauses, smiling)
Very true.


DEAN opens the driver side door and rock music starts to play. He starts the car as SAM walks, frustratedly, to the passenger side and gets in.
