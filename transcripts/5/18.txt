NOW

INT. BAR - NIGHT

STUART
Let me guess. Pink-slipped?

ZACHARIAH
That obvious, huh?

STUART
Hmm. It takes one to know one.

STUART
“Outsourcing.” What was your crime against humanity?

ZACHARIAH
Deal of the millennium. Couldn’t even get the one simple ‘yes’ I needed. Got to nail that bottom line, right?

STUART
I hear that.

ZACHARIAH
That’s all they care about upstairs, ain’t it? Results, results, results. They don’t know. They’re not down on the ground, in the mud, nose to nose with all you pig-filthy humans, am I right?

STUART
Absolute—filthy what?

ZACHARIAH
I mean, what ever happened to personal loyalty? How long have I worked for these guys? Five millennia? Six?

STUART
Seems like it, don’t it?

ZACHARIAH
God–damned straight, it does.

ZACHARIAH
Two more.

ZACHARIAH
Zack.

STUART
Stuart.

ZACHARIAH
What are you going to do next, Stuart?

STUART
Hell, I don’t know. Maybe something to do with the Internet.

ZACHARIAH
Yeah?

STUART
Whoa. Earthquake?

ZACHARIAH
No. My boss.

The bar shakes, bottles start to fall over, glass shatters, and there is the ear-piercing sound of an angel’s true voice.

ZACHARIAH
Go ahead! Get it over with. I’m ready.

STUART and THE BARKEEPER scream as their eyes are burned out and they die.

ZACHARIAH
Wait, what? Yes! Anything, of course! Just—just put me back in. You won’t regret it.

ZACHARIAH
Thank you! Thank you!

The noise fades, the blinding white light diminishes, and ZACHARIAH drains his glass.

ZACHARIAH
Ah. Back in business, boys! *singing* Oh when the Saints go marching in, oh when the Saints…

SUPERNATURAL


Act One



INT. MOTEL – NIGHT

DEAN packs away his belongings in a box, including his leather jacket, his keys, his gun, and a letter. He marks the box for ROBERT SINGER after he tapes it shut.

SAM
Sending someone a candy-gram?

DEAN
How’d you find me?

SAM
You’re going to kill yourself, right? It’s not too hard to figure out the stops on the Farewell Tour. How’s Lisa doing, anyways?

DEAN
I’m not going to kill myself.

SAM
No? So Michael’s not about to make you his Muppet? What the hell, man? This is how it ends? You just…walk out?

DEAN
Yeah, I guess.

SAM
How could you do that?

DEAN
How could I? All you’ve ever done is run away.

SAM
And I was wrong. Every single time I did.

SAM
Just…please. Not now. Bobby is working on something.

DEAN
Oh, really? What?

SAM doesn’t answer.

DEAN
You got nothing and you know it.

SAM
You know I have to stop you.

DEAN
Yeah, well, you can try. Just remember: You’re not all hopped up on demon blood this time.

SAM
Yeah, I know. But I brought help.

DEAN turns around to find CASTIEL standing behind him. CASTIEL touches his fingers to DEAN’s forehead, knocking him out.

INT. BOBBY’S STUDY – DAY

DEAN
Yeah, no, this is good. Really. You know, eight months of turned pages and screwed pooches but tonight, tonight’s when the magic happens.

BOBBY
You ain’t helpin’.

DEAN
Yeah, well, why don’t you let me get out of your hair, then?

BOBBY
What the hell happened to you?

DEAN
Reality happened. Nuclear’s the only option we have left. Michael can ice the devil, save a boatload of people.

BOBBY
But not all of them. We gotta think of something else.

DEAN
Yeah, well, that’s easy for you to say. But if Lucifer burns this mother down, and I coulda done something about it, guess what? That’s on me.

BOBBY
You can’t give up, son.

DEAN
You’re not my father. And you ain’t in my shoes.

BOBBY pulls out a gun out of his desk and sets it on the table. He takes a bullet out of his pocket and looks at it.

DEAN
What is that?

BOBBY
That’s the round that I mean to put through my skull.

BOBBY sets the bullet down on his desk in front of him.

BOBBY
Every morning, I look at it. I think, “Maybe today’s the day I flip the lights out.” But I don’t do it. I never do it. You know why? Because I promised you I wouldn’t give up!

CASTIEL grasps his head and hunches over in pain.

SAM
Cas, you okay?

CASTIEL
No.

SAM
What’s wrong?

CASTIEL
Something’s happening.

DEAN
Where?

CASTIEL disappears. Wind throws papers around the room.

EXT. WOODS – DAY

CASTIEL looks around, begins walking towards a clearing in fallen trees. The ground is pulsing like it’s alive. CASTIEL reaches to touch it, but is attacked from behind.

CASTIEL stakes his two assailants and goes back to that area of ground. A hand reaches up, and CASTIEL pulls out the body of ADAM MILLIGAN.

INT. BOBBY’S KITCHEN – DAY

DEAN
I’m gonna get a beer, do you mind?

SAM moves out of the way of the fridge.

INT. BOBBY’S STUDY – DAY

Wind blows papers and CASTIEL appears with ADAM’s body.

CASTIEL
Help.

BOBBY
Boys!

CASTIEL lays ADAM down on the cot.

BOBBY
Who is it?

SAM
That’s our brother.


Act Two



INT. BOBBY’S STUDY – DAY

BOBBY
Wait a minute. Your brother? Adam?

DEAN
Cas, what the hell?

CASTIEL
Angels.

SAM
Angels? Why?

CASTIEL
I know one thing for sure. We need to hide him now.

CASTIEL puts his hand to ADAM's chest and brands the Enochian symbols on his ribs to hide him from angels. ADAM wakes up.

ADAM
Where am I?

SAM
It's okay. Just relax, you're safe.

ADAM
Who the hell are you?

DEAN
You're going to find this a little...a lot crazy, but we're actually your brothers.

SAM
It's the truth. John Winchester was our father, too. See, I'm Sam--

ADAM
Yeah, and I'm sure that's Dean. I know who you are.

SAM
How?

ADAM
They warned me about you.

DEAN
Who did?

ADAM
The angels. Now where the hell is Zachariah?

DEAN
So why don't you just tell us everything? Start from the beginning.

ADAM
Well, I was dead and in Heaven. 'Cept it—it uh, kinda looked like my prom and I was making out with this girl, her name was Kristin McGee--

DEAN
Yeah, that sounds like heaven. Did you get to third base?

SAM
Just uh, just keep going.

ADAM
Well, these…these angels, they popped out of nowhere, and they tell me that I—I'm chosen.

SAM
For what?

ADAM
To save the world.

DEAN
How you gonna do that?

ADAM
Oh, me and some archangel are going to kill the devil.

DEAN
What archangel?

ADAM
Michael. I'm his uh, sword or vessel or something, I don't know.

DEAN
Well, that's insane.

CASTIEL
Not necessarily.

DEAN
How do you mean?

CASTIEL
Maybe they're moving on from you, Dean.

DEAN
Well that doesn't make sense.

CASTIEL
He is John Winchester's bloodline, Sam's brother. It's not perfect, but it's possible.

DEAN
Well you gotta be kidding me.

SAM
Why would they do this?

CASTIEL
Maybe they're desperate. Maybe they wrongly assumed Dean would be brave enough to withstand them.

DEAN
Alright, you know what? Blow me, Cas.

SAM
Look, no way. After everything that's happened? All that crap about destiny? Suddenly the angels have a Plan B? Does that smell right to anybody?

ADAM
You know this has been a really moving family reunion, but uh, I got a thing, so—

SAM
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Sit down. Just listen, okay? Please.

ADAM
It's unbelievable.

SAM
Now, Adam…the angels are lying to you. They're full of crap.

ADAM
Yeah, I don't think so.

SAM
Really. Why not?

ADAM
Um, 'cause they're angels.

SAM
They tell you they were gonna roast half the planet?

ADAM
They said the fight might get pretty hairy, but it is the devil, right? So we got to stop him.

SAM
Yeah, but there's another way.

ADAM
Great. What is it?

DEAN
We're working on "the power of love.”

ADAM
How's that going?

DEAN
Mmm. Not good.

SAM
Look, Adam…You don't know me from a hole in the wall, I know. But I'm begging you. Please, just trust me. Give me some time.

ADAM
Give me one good reason.

SAM
Because we're blood.

ADAM
You've got no right to say that to me.

BOBBY
You're still John's boy.

ADAM
No, John Winchester was some guy who took me to a baseball game once a year. I don't have a dad. So we may be blood, but we are not family. My mom is my family. And if I do my job, I get to see her again. So no offense, but she's the one I give a rat's ass about, not you.

SAM
Fair enough. But if you have one good memory of dad, just one, then you'll give us a little more time. Please.

ADAM is playing with a half-eaten sandwich. He sees BOBBY turn around in his chair, and looks at the door in the kitchen to escape.

SAM
Going somewhere?

ADAM
Out for a...beer.

SAM
Great. We got beer. Have a seat.

ADAM
Great. You know, you pitched this whole dewy-eyed bromance thing, but the truth is, I'm on lockdown, aren't I?

SAM
Adam, you may not believe it, but dad was trying to protect you. Keeping you from all of this.

ADAM
Yeah well, I guess the monster that ate me didn't get that memo.

SAM
You remember that?

ADAM
Oh yeah.

SAM
Still, trust me. The one thing worse than seeing dad once a year was seeing him all year.

ADAM
Do you know how full of crap you are?

SAM
What?

ADAM
Really. You see, it was me and it was my mom. That's it. She worked the graveyard shift at the hospital. I cooked my own dinners. I put myself to bed. So you can say whatever you want about our dad, but the truth is, I would have taken anything.

SAM nods his head a little.

ADAM
Alright?

SAM
Look, if we had known we had a brother—

ADAM
Well, you didn’t, so…

SAM
—We would have found you.

ADAM scoffs and shakes his head.

SAM
Look, I can't change the past. I wish I could. But from here on out—

ADAM
What? We gonna hop in the family truckster? Pop on down to Wally World?

SAM
Tell you one thing, with an attitude like that, you would have fit right in around here.

INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM - DAY

DEAN
Well, Cas, not for nothing, but the last person who looked at me like that…I got laid.

SAM
Uh, why don't you, uh, go keep an eye on Adam?

DEAN
Is this really necessary?

SAM
Well, I mean, we got our hands full, Dean... A house full of flight risks.

DEAN
I’m not letting him do it.

SAM
Who, Adam? No, I'm... I'm not, either.

DEAN
No, you're not getting me.

SAM
Oh, no, no, I "get" you perfectly. But I'm not letting you do it, either.

DEAN
That kid's not taking a bullet for me.

SAM
Dean…

DEAN
I’m serious. I mean, think about how many people we've gotten killed, Sam. Mom, Dad, Jess, Jo, Ellen. Should I keep going?

SAM
It’s not like we pulled the trigger.

DEAN
We might as well have. I’m tired, man. I’m tired of fighting who I'm supposed to be.

SAM
Well, do you think maybe you could take a half a second and stop trying to sacrifice yourself for a change? Maybe we could actually stick together?

DEAN
I don’t think so.

SAM
Why not? Dean, seriously. Tell me. I—I want to know.

DEAN
I just…I—I don’t believe.

SAM
In what?

DEAN
In you. I mean, I don’t. I don’t know whether it’s gonna be demon blood or some other demon chick or what, but…I do know they're gonna find a way to turn you.

SAM
So you’re saying I’m not strong enough.

DEAN
You’re angry, you’re self-righteous. Lucifer's gonna wear you to the prom, man. It's just a matter of time.

SAM
Don't say that to me. Not you...of all people.

DEAN
I don’t want to. But it’s the truth. And when Satan takes you over, there's got to be somebody there to fight him, and it ain't gonna be that kid. So, it's got to be me.

INT. BOBBY’S STUDY – DAY

BOBBY
How’s he doing?

SAM shrugs and scoffs.

BOBBY
How you doing?

SAM nods slightly.

INT. BOBBY’S BASEMENT – DAY

CASTIEL goes downstairs to check on DEAN. He hears a crash and goes to the panic room door.

CASTIEL
Dean? Dean?

DEAN
Cas.

DEAN has an angel banishing sigil drawn on the inside of a cabinet. He presses his hand to it, sending CASTIEL away screaming. DEAN escapes.


Act Three



INT. BOBBY’S STUDY – DAY

BOBBY
Where’s Cas?

SAM
Blown to Oz.

SAM
Look, I’ll get Dean. He couldn’t have gone too far. Just watch Adam.

BOBBY
How? You may have noticed, he’s got a slight height advantage.

SAM
Then cuff him to your chair. I don’t know. Just watch him.

EXT. PARK – DAY (IN ADAM’S DREAM)

ADAM is sitting on a park bench, looking out at the playground when ZACHARIAH appears sitting next to him.

ZACHARIAH
You’re mom’s not coming, you know. This is the park where your mom took you on her day off, right? She’s not coming. Not yet. But she will…soon.

ADAM
You’re Zachariah, right?

ZACHARIAH
I am. You weren’t where you were supposed to be, kid.

ADAM
Yeah, I know.

ZACHARIAH
Can't quite zero in on you, either. So, let me take a wild guess. You're with Sam and Dean?

ADAM
Yeah.

ZACHARIAH
Didn’t we tell you about them?

ADAM nods.

ZACHARIAH
So you know you can’t trust them, right? You know Sam and Dean Winchester are psychotically, irrationally, erotically codependent on each other, right?

ADAM
I don’t know. They said a few things about you.

ZACHARIAH
Really? Trust me, kid, when the heat gets hot, they're not gonna give a flying crap about you. Hell, they'd rather save each other's sweet bacon than save the planet. They're not your family. Understand? Now...you want to see your mom again or not?

INT. BOBBY’S STUDY – NIGHT

ADAM jolts awake from his dream.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

PREACHER
The end is nigh! The apocalypse is upon us! The angels talk to me, and they asked me to talk to you! The apocalypse—

DEAN
Hey! I’m Dean Winchester. Do you know who I am?

PREACHER
Dear God.

DEAN
I’ll take that as a yes. Listen, I need you to pray to your angel buddies and let them know that I’m here.

The PREACHER falls to his knees in prayer.

PREACHER
Our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name—

CASTIEL
You pray too loud.

CASTIEL touches the PREACHER and he falls to the ground, unconscious. He drags DEAN into the nearby alley and beats him up.

DEAN
What, are you crazy?

CASTIEL
I rebelled for this?! So that you could surrender to them?

DEAN
Cas! Please!

CASTIEL
I gave everything for you. And this is what you give to me.

DEAN
Do it. Just do it!

CASTIEL unclenches his fist and touches DEAN’s shoulder, knocking him out.

INT. BOBBY’S STUDY – NIGHT

SAM
Bobby, what do you mean, “Adam is gone?”

BOBBY
Should I say it in Spanish?

SAM
He’s gone how? What the hell, Bobby?!

BOBBY
Watch your tone, boy. He was right in front of me, and he disappeared into thin air.

CASTIEL appears carrying a bloody and battered DEAN.

CASTIEL
Because the angels took him.

SAM
What the hell happened to him?

CASTIEL
Me.

BOBBY
What do you mean, the angels took Adam? You branded his ribs, didn’t you?

CASTIEL
Yes. Adam must have tipped them.

BOBBY
How?

CASTIEL
I don’t know. Maybe in a dream.

SAM
Well, where would they have taken him?

INT. ANGEL GREEN ROOM – NIGHT

There is a table with beer and burgers piled high. ADAM grabs a burger and digs in.

ZACHARIAH
I see you and your brother share the same refined palate.

ADAM
Ah. So, uh… We ready?

ZACHARIAH
For what?

ADAM
What do you mean, for what? For Michael.

ZACHARIAH
Oh. Right. About that…Look, this is never easy, but I’m afraid…we’ve had to terminate your position at this time.

ADAM
Excuse me?

ZACHARIAH
Hey, don’t get me wrong. You’ve been a hell of a sport, really. Good stuff. But the thing is, you’re not so much the “chosen one” as you are…a clammy scrap of bait.

ADAM
No…but what about the stuff that you said? I’m supposed to fight the devil.

ZACHARIAH
Mmm, not so much. Hey, if it’s any consolation, you happen to be the illegitimate half-brother of the guy we do care about. That’s not bad, is it?

ADAM
So you lied…about everything.

ZACHARIAH
We didn’t lie. We just avoided certain truths to manipulate you.

ADAM
Oh, you son of a bitch.

ZACHARIAH
Hey, how do you think I feel? I’m the one that’s got to put up with that dumb, slack-jawed look on your face. Kid, we didn’t have a choice. The Winchesters got one blind spot, and it’s family. See, Sam and Dean, they’re gonna put aside their differences and they're gonna come get you, and that is gonna put Dean right…here…Right where I need him. This is the night, kid! Our night. Michael’s seen it. The tumblers finally click into place, and it’s all because of you. And me. But who’s keeping score?

ADAM
Yeah, I’m not gonna let you do this.

ZACHARIAH
Cool your jets, corky. Sit down. We’re doing it together. Plus, you still get your severance. You still get to see your mom, okay?

ADAM
Why should I believe you?

ZACHARIAH
You know what? I keep hearing this.

ZACHARIAH makes his hand do a talking motion.

ZACHARIAH
But what I want to be hearing is this.

ZACHARIAH closes his hand-mouth and causes ADAM to fall on the table, spitting up blood.

ZACHARIAH
Yeah. That’s better.

INT. BOBBY’S PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN is handcuffed to a cot.

SAM
How you feeling?

DEAN
Word to the wise: don’t piss off the nerd angels. So how’s it going?

SAM
Adam’s gone. The angels have him.

DEAN
Where?

SAM
The room where they took you.

DEAN
You sure?

SAM
Cas did a re-con.

DEAN
And?

SAM
And the place is crawling with mooks…Pretty much a no-shot-in-hell, hail-Mary kind of thing.

DEAN
Ah, so the usual. What are you going to do?

SAM
For starters…I’m bringing you with.

DEAN
Excuse me?

SAM unlocks DEAN’s handcuffs, releasing him.

SAM
There are too many of them. We can’t do it alone. And uh, you’re pretty much the only game in town.

DEAN
Isn’t that a bad idea?

SAM
Cas and Bobby think so. I’m not so sure.

DEAN
Well, they’re right. Because either it’s a trap to get me there to make me say yes, or it’s not a trap and I’m gonna say yes anyway. And I will. I’ll do it. Fair warning.

SAM
No, you won’t. When push shoves, you’ll make the right call.

DEAN
You know, if tables were turned…I’d let you rot in here. Hell, I have let you rot in here.

SAM
Yeah, well…I guess I’m not that smart.

DEAN
I—I don’t get it. Sam, why are you doing this?

SAM
Because… you’re still my big brother.


Act Four



EXT. OUTSIDE AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE– DAY

DEAN
Where the hell are we?

CASTIEL
Van Nuys, California.

DEAN
Where’s the beautiful room?

CASTIEL
In there.

DEAN
The beautiful room is in an abandoned muffler factory in Van Nuys, California?

CASTIEL
Where’d you think it was?

DEAN
I—I don’t know. Jupiter? A blade of grass? Not Van Nuys.

SAM
Tell me again why you don’t just grab Adam and shazam the hell out of there.

CASTIEL
Because there are at least five angels in there.

DEAN
So? You’re fast.

CASTIEL
They’re faster.

CASTIEL takes off his tie and wraps it around his palm.

CASTIEL
I’ll clear them out. You two grab the boy. This is our only chance.

DEAN
Whoa, wait. You’re gonna take on five angels?

CASTIEL
Yes.

DEAN
Isn’t that suicide?

CASTIEL
Maybe it is. But then I won’t have to watch you fail. I’m sorry, Dean. I don’t have the same faith in you that Sam does.

CASTIEL pulls a box cutter out of his trench-coat pocket.

SAM
What the hell are you gonna do with that?

INT. WAREHOUSE – DAY

CASTIEL walks into the warehouse and the door closes behind him. He walks towards a room and is attacked from behind by an angels. He kills one, drops his blade, and taunts the rest.

CASTIEL
What are you waiting for? Come on.

As the angels close in on CASTIEL, he rips open his shirt showing an angel banishing sigil carved onto his chest. He presses his palm into it, sending all the angels, including himself, away.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

DEAN and SAM enter the warehouse through the same door CASTIEL did. DEAN finds the one slain angel and goes into the room.

INT. ANGEL GREEN ROOM - DAY

DEAN sees ADAM on the floor against the opposite wall. He hurries to his side to help him leave.

DEAN
Adam, hey. Hey.

ADAM
You came for me.

DEAN
Yeah, well, you’re family.

ADAM
Dean, it’s a trap.

DEAN
I figured.

ZACHARIAH
Dean, please. Did you really think it would be that easy?

DEAN
Did you?

SAM comes at ZACHARIAH from behind with an angel blade. ZACHARIAH knocks it out of his hand and throws SAM against a screen.

DEAN
Sam!

ZACHARIAH
You know what I’ve learned from this experience, Dean? Patience.

ZACHARIAH waves his hand and ADAM falls to the floor, coughing up blood.

DEAN
Adam? Let him go, you son of a bitch.

ZACHARIAH
I mean, I thought I was downsized for sure. And for us, a firing...pretty damn literal. But I should have trusted the boss man. It's all playing out like he said...You, me, your hemorrhaging brothers.

ZACHARIAH turns his fist in SAM’s direction, causing him to cough up blood like ADAM.

ZACHARIAH
You're finally ready, right?

DEAN looks from ZACHARIAH to SAM and ADAM who are lying on the floor, still coughing up blood.

ZACHARIAH
You know there's no other choice. There’s never been a choice.

DEAN
Stop it. Stop it right now!

ZACHARIAH
In exchange for what?

DEAN
Damn it, Zachariah. Stop it, please. I’ll do it.

ZACHARIAH
I’m sorry. What was that?

DEAN
Okay, yes. The answer is yes.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN
Do you hear me? Call Michael down, you bastard!

ZACHARIAH
How do I know you’re not lying?

DEAN
Do I look like I’m lying?

ZACHARIAH turns and speaks in Enochian, summoning the archangel MICHAEL.

ZACHARIAH
Zodiredo…noco…aberamage…nazodpesade… He’s coming.

SAM gives DEAN a questioning look. DEAN winks at SAM.

DEAN
Of course, I have a few conditions.

ZACHARIAH
What?

DEAN
The few people whose safety you have to guarantee before I say yes.

ZACHARIAH
Sure, fine. Make a list.

DEAN
But most of all…Michael can’t have me until he disintegrates you.

ZACHARIAH
What did you say?

DEAN
I said…before Michael gets one piece of this sweet ass…he has to turn you into a piece of charcoal.

ZACHARIAH
You really think Michael’s gonna go for that?

DEAN
Who’s more important to him now? You…or me?

ZACHARIAH
You listen to me. You are nothing but a maggot inside a worm’s ass. Do you know who I am…after I deliver you to Michael?

DEAN
Expendable.

ZACHARIAH
Michael’s not gonna kill me.

DEAN
Maybe not. But I am.

DEAN stabs an angel blade into ZACHARIAH’s head through his chin. DEAN falls to the ground. White light and the ear-piercing noise indicate MICHAEL is coming.

DEAN
Can you walk?

ADAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Okay, come on.

DEAN helps ADAM up and runs over to SAM.

DEAN
Come on, move it!

The green room’s door slams shut behind SAM and DEAN, leaving ADAM locked inside.

ADAM
No! Dean! Help! It won’t open!

DEAN leaves SAM and attempts to open the green room’s door from the outside. He is burned when he touches the knob.

ADAM
Dean, help! Dean!

DEAN
Hold on! We’ll get you out. Just hold on. Adam! Can you hear me?!

The green room is filled with white light. Outside, it fades, and Dean can touch the door. He opens it to find it an abandoned office.

DEAN
Adam?

EXT. IMPALA, HIGHWAY - NIGHT

SAM
You think Adam’s okay?

DEAN
Doubt it. Cas either. But we’ll get ‘em.

SAM
So.

DEAN
“So” what?

SAM
I saw your eyes. You were totally rockin’ the “yes” back there. So, what changed your mind?

DEAN
Honestly? The damnedest thing. I mean, the world’s ending. The walls are coming down on us, and I look over to you and all I can think about is, “this stupid son of a bitch brought me here.” I just didn’t want to let you down.

SAM
You didn’t. You almost did. But you didn’t.

DEAN
I owe you an apology.

SAM
No, man. No, you don't.

DEAN
Just...let me say this. I don't know if it's being a big brother or what, but to me, you've always been this snot-nosed kid that I've had to keep on the straight and narrow. I think we both know that that's not you anymore. I mean, hell, if you're grown-up enough to find faith in me…the least I can do is return the favor. So screw destiny, right in the face. I say we take the fight to them, and do it our way.

SAM
Sounds good.
