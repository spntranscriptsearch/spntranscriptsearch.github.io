TEASER
[A black screen. The soft piano intro of 'The Famous Final Scene" by Bob Seger and Silver Bullet Band plays. The camera softly changes to a close up of flames. As it gently pulls back, it is revealed to be a Hunter's Funeral Pyre with Dean staring into the lapping flames.

Now Dean stands in the bunker silently looking at the place on the floor where Kevin died. Then he looks at the table where Kevin was working. All of his books and notes still lay open and there is a plate with a half eaten sandwich and an almost empty glass of milk. There is no sound just the music continues to play. Dean picks up Kevin's phone and when he lights up the screen we see that Kevin had a picture of himself and his mother as the background. There is nothing but pure devastation on Dean's face. He fights back tears as he touches his forehead to the phone in his hand.

Then he explodes. He throws the phone against the wall with all his strength and in almost the same movement sends everything on the table flying to the floor. He shoves the lamp off the table and slings a heavy chair across the room. The camera zooms in on his face as he leans on the table. First white anger then utter despair cross his face as he looks around realizing that he is completely alone. The last notes of the song fade out.]

TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
[Scene opens backstage of a huge rock concert. The rock star (a boy in his early 20's, with long blond hair and glasses on inside is dressed all in leather) and his manager round the corner]

CROWD in the background

Corey! Corey! Corey! Corey! Corey! Corey!

MANAGER

You're on in 10. The label wants to open with "Baby, Be My Baby." Then you can roll right on into "Babycakes," and then the clean version of "Babymaker."

Oh, and, Corey?

Let's try to take it easy with the groupies tonight, huh?

COREY

Yeah, whatever.

[They reach his dressing room door and when they open it they see GADREEL (in SAM's body) sitting inside. The manager reacts quickly]

MANAGER

The hell – security!

COREY

It's fine, Margey. You can go.

MANAGER MARGEY

What? Corey –

COREY lowering his sunglasses

Bitch, did I stutter?!

[COREY enters and shuts the door behind him. GADREEL rises]

COREY

Hello, Gadreel.

GADREEL

Thaddeus. That's a new look, I must say.

COREY/THADDEUS

Well, what can I say, you know? We all got booted out of the penthouse, and I just kind of figured... Why be an angel when you can be a God? [he motions to the monitor on the wall showing the raging crowd.]

How are you, old friend?

GADREEL

I am not your friend.

THADDEUS

Well, I think you're being a little bit mean there, considering all the quality time we spent together.

GADREEL

I was imprisoned, and you tortured me.

THADDEUS

Heaven has rules. Do the crime, do the time. That's it.

GADREEL

I made a mistake.

THADDEUS

I was a guard. I was doing my job.

GADREEL

What you did to Abner, was that was your job?

THADDEUS

Your boyfriend? Now, that, mnh – that was just fun. Is that what you're here for – the big payback? Fine. If you want to get a little bloody, uh, I have no problem kicking your ass – again. You know, w-we'll say for old time's sa –

[THADDEUS pauses as he bends down to open his guitar case but finds it empty]

GADREEL [holding an angel blade]

Looking for this?

THADDEUS

Gadreel...I'm sorry.

[GADREEL stabs him in the chest and he explodes in angel light]

[Scene changes to DEAN in the bunker's main room packing up every kind of weapon he owns into his duffel bag on the table.]

CASTIEL

Dean.

DEAN looks up to see CASTIEL standing there

Cas. Now, look at you, all suited up and back in the game.

CASTIEL

I, um... I came as soon as you called. I wa –

[CASTIEL stops when he notices the broken lamp on the floor. His eyes travel to the strewn books and papers and the broken chair. He is immediately concerned for his friend.]

CASTIEL

Dean, what happened? What's wrong?

[DEAN stops his packing and his face melts in emotion as he looks to his friend. Camera pans behind CASTIEL's back and when it comes out on his other side the men are sitting at the table and DEAN has just told CASTIEL the long, hurtful story.]

DEAN

Sammy was dying. What was I supposed to do?

CASTIEL

You let an angel possess him?

DEAN

He said it was the only way, and I believed him. Now Sam's gone. Kevin's...

CASTIEL

Dean, I'm sorry.

DEAN

Yeah, well... Sorry don't pay the bills, does it? It sure as hell ain't gonna bring Kevin back. We got to find

that son of a bitch.

CASTIEL

Dean. If the angel possessing Sam isn't Ezekiel, then who is it?

DEAN

A dead man walking.

CASTIEL

What, you're gonna destroy him?

DEAN

Damn right.

CASTIEL

You kill an angel, its vessel dies, too.

DEAN

Think I don't know that? If I don't end Sam and that halo burns him out and I...

God, I was so damn stupid.

CASTIEL

You were stupid for the right reasons.

DEAN

Yeah, like that matters.

CASTIEL

It does. Sometimes that's all that matters.

CASTIEL

Listen to me. Sam is strong. If he knew an angel was possessing him, he could fight. He could cast the angel out.

DEAN

Maybe. But as far as I know, he's in the dark. I don't know how we clue him in.

CASTIEL

Do you remember Alfie?

DEAN

The kid angel? Yeah. Why?

CASTIEL

Before he died, he told me the demons were able to dig into his mind, access his coding. We might be able to do that here. Might be able to – to bypass the angel and talk directly to Sam.

DEAN

And you think that would work?

CASTIEL

I don't know, but I think we should try.

DEAN

Okay. Um, where do we start?

[Scene switches to DEAN and CASTIEL entering the bunker dungeon.]

CROWLEY

Hello, boys.

DEAN

Here's the deal – you're gonna tell us how to hack an angel, and I'm gonna give you some of the good stuff. [DEAN holds up a syringe of blood]

Human blood, fresh from the tap. [pats his own arm]

Word is you're jonesing for it.

CROWLEY

Please. I'll pass.

CASTIEL

What do you want, then?

CROWLEY

Well, for starters... A massage. Between the sitting and the shackles, a body gets a little stiff.

DEAN

Yeah, I ain't rubbing you.

CROWLEY

God, no. Get Kevin. His tiny fists can really work wonder –

CASTIEL

Kevin is dead.

CROWLEY

Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

CASTIEL [harshly]

Don't pretend you care. You tried to kill him.

CROWLEY

I told him this was gonna happen. I was the only person who tried to warn him. I told him to run.

DEAN

From what?

CROWLEY

You.

How many times am I gonna have to say this? People in your general vicinity don't have much in the way

of a life-span.

Now, I can't teach you how to crack open an angel. It's more... art than science. But I can do it for you. All I ask in return is a little field trip. Dying for some fresh air. Chains on, naturally.

DEAN

No.

CROWLEY

No? Of course not. Because if I'm plan "A," I'm sure you have a totally viable, much better plan "B."

CASTIEL [and DEAN pull aside]

You can't be considering this.

DEAN

With the chains on, he can't do anything.

CASTIEL

It's Crowley. He can always do something.

CROWLEY

Looks like we need a tiebreaker. Go get Moose, squirrel. [DEAN's mask slips and you can see his guilt]

Unless... Unless, of course, you can't. That's why you're here, isn't it? The poor giant baby's in trouble again, isn't he?

DEAN

Are you done?

CROWLEY

Depends. Do we have a deal?

DEAN

Yeah.

CROWLEY

Excellent. When do we leave?

DEAN

Soon as I can scrounge up a ride.

CASTIEL

Well, I have a vehicle. It stopped a few miles from here, inexplicably.

[Scene changes to a front yard with a dog eating out of a food bowl that reads Muffin's in pink letters. A lady picks her up and pets her as she notices CASTIEL, CROWLEY and DEAN walking down the street. CROWLEY's cuffs are covered by his jacket folded over his arms and DEAN is carrying a gas can. They approach CASTIEL's car. It is a cream colored 1978 Lincoln Continental]

CROWLEY to CASTIEL

Really? What are you, a pimp?

CASTIEL

I like it.

DEAN [tries to start it]

Yeah, it's out of gas.

CROWLEY

Riddle me this, boy wonder. Why do you need the wheels?

CASTIEL

When you betray us, I'll be the one to carve out your heart.

CROWLEY

Oh, Cas, such a flirt.

DEAN [finishes filling the tank]

All right. Let's go.

CROWLEY

Shotgun.

DEAN

Uh, wrong. You're in the back.

[CASTIEL smirks at CROWLEY and steps to the front.]

DEAN

Hey – you, too. Keep an eye on him.

[CROWLEY now smirks at CASTIEL and gets in the back. CASTIEL rolls his eyes and follows.

CROWLEY

Hey. Watch the leg.

CASTIEL

You're on my side.

DEAN from the front

Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Scene switches to METATRON sitting in a bar drinking a martini. The bartender walks up and we see that it is GADREEL's former vessel from the hospital before he possessed SAM]


BARTENDER

Get you anything else?

METATRON

I'm good, thanks.

[GADREEL walks in and sets the backpack with the tablets on the counter for METATRON to see.]

METATRON

Welcome home, sweethearts.

[GADREEL looks at his former vessel as he looks back with a foggy look as if he is trying to remember something.]

METATRON

Strange seeing an old vessel, isn't it? Like looking in a funhouse mirror. But first things first – the tasks I gave you, any hiccups?

GADREEL

Killing Thaddeus was easy. He had it coming.

METATRON

I know all about your history. Why do you think I gave you his name? Consider it your signing bonus.

And the kid?

GADREEL

That was...less easy.

METATRON

He was a threat, but I flipped a switch upstairs, and now that Kevin is gone, there will be no more Prophets. And what about Dean Winchester?

GADREEL

You never gave me his name, Metatron.

METATRON

Not much for seizing the initiative, are we? Gadreel, we are writing our own epic story here. To make that work, sometimes you have to kill your darlings. It's not like you haven't done worse before.

[GADREEL gives him a very angry look]

Sorry. Sorry. Onto new business.

[METATRON slides a folded napkin over to GADREEL]

Your next target.

GADREEL spits out angrily

How many more lives do I have to take?

METATRON

It's not your place to ask questions. It is your place to obey. You want to be my second in command? Prove you're ready. Prove you're loyal. Or don't. Walk away. Go back to being Gadreel the traitor, the sap, heaven's longest-running joke.

[Scene changes back to the lady with the dog named Mittens. The dog is nowhere to be seen but the bowl is filled with blood and she is chanting a spell over it to turn it into a Blood Phone]

DOG LADY

Inferni clamavi ad te regem.

Abaddon?

I found him.

Crowley is on the move.

ACT TWO
[Scene opens with CASTIEL, CROWLEY and DEAN sitting in the lobby of a fancy office building that looks like a financial association.]

DEAN

Your source is in here?

CROWLEY

And she can track anything you need, even our little lost Samantha.

CASTIEL

How?

CROWLEY

Well, this place isn't really...this. It's a front for an N.S.A. listening post.

CASTIEL

What are they listening for?

CROWLEY

Everything. The U.S. government is quite the voyeur these days. So I planted one of my best and let her go to work.

CASTIEL

Looking for terrorists?

CROWLEY

Looking for marks, slow boat.

[Two security guards approach]

Mr. Crowley? She'll see you now.

[CASTIEL and DEAN stand up to join him]

Uh, just Mr. Crowley.

CASTIEL

I'll be listening to every word you say.

CROWLEY

Promise?

[CROWLEY is shown into a high tech office with a sharp looking lady behind a desk.]

CROWLEY

Cecily. How are you?

CECILY

Better than you. That was Dean Winchester, and...Castiel?

CROWLEY

Yes, I know. Without the tie, he's barely recognizable. It's so –

CECILY

...hot. I mean, human Castiel? Eh. But feathered Castiel?

CROWLEY

Human Castiel?

CECILY

You heard what happened to him, right?

CROWLEY

I've been tied up. Pray, do tell.

[DEAN and CASTIEL are still sitting in the lobby.]

DEAN

Hear anything?

CASTIEL

No. The room Crowley's in has been warded.

DEAN

Awesome. That's friggin' awesome.

[CECILY continues updating CROWLEY on the highpoints of the months he's missed.]

CECILY

So captain sexy out there totally cuts another angel's throat, yoinks his Grace, and now? He's got his mojo back – minus the broken wings.

CROWLEY

Well, that explains the hooptie. And we know all this how?

CECILY

I tuned one of our satellites to pick up angel radio.

CROWLEY

Impressive.

CECILY

Yeah. Not just a pretty face.

CROWLEY

What about Hell?

CECILY

No one's doing their job. I send oodles of data down there every week, but does Hell give a damn? No.

CROWLEY

Well. Of course. With Abaddon in charge, you...?

CECILY

Oh, that "b" with an "itch" ain't the boss. I mean, she's got a few of the more aggro types on her side. But most are just waiting to see who takes the belt – you or her.

CROWLEY

They're still afraid of me.

CECILY

Probably 'cause they don't know you're in cuffs.

CROWLEY lifting his wrists

Speaking of which... Do they come off?

CECILY

Not without the key.

CROWLEY

Fine. I need you to do me a favor. Can you find this car for me? [He hands a piece of paper to her]

CECILY [reading the note]

Easy-peasy.

[She turns to her computer and starts entering the IMPALA's license plate numbers]

CROWLEY

Nice to know someone's still loyal.

CECILY [unconvincingly]

Uh-huh.

CROWLEY

That is, of course, if you're not playing both sides?

CECILY [with a pointed look]

Wouldn't you?

[Back in the lobby, CROWLEY hands DEAN a paper with pictures of the IMPALA going through an intersection.]

CROWLEY

Your phallus on wheels just ran a red light in Somerset, Pennsylvania, 10 minutes ago.

DEAN

Let's go.

CROWLEY

The three amigos ride again.

CASTIEL

He's not my amigo.

[Scene changes to GADREEL getting out of the IMPALA and approaching a house with a man bending over a flower garden picking weeds. He has his back to GADREEL.]

GADREEL

Alexander Sarver?

MAN [turning around]

Yeah?

[His face lights up in recognition]

Gadreel?

GADREEL [shocked]

Abner?

ABNER

I thought you were dead. W-what happened? W-what are you doing here?

GADREEL

I – What are you doing here?

[A little girl runs out of the house]

Daddy! Daddy!

ABNER picks her up

Hey. Delilah, this is daddy's best friend. Can you say hi?

DELILAH

Hi.

GADREEL

You have a child?

ABNER

I have family, Gadreel. Look, my wife and the niblet are going to a movie. Swing back in a few hours so we can catch up. Okay?

GADREEL

Okay. Sure.

[Later at ABNER's house, GADREEL and ABNER sit in his livingroom]

GADREEL

So, um, you have a job?

ABNER

Customer support – computers mostly. It's like answering prayers, but they pay you for it.

GADREEL

You have changed, Abner.

ABNER

Yeah, well, I was a crappy angel. I was petulant. I deserted my post. I spent 700 years in heaven's lockup. I... No. Doesn't matter. We're a long way from Thaddeus now.

GADREEL

I killed him, Abner. I got our revenge.

ABNER

I w – I wish you hadn't done that.

GADREEL

But why? He tortured us – you most of all.

ABNER

I remember. And I remember you were always there to put me back together.

GADREEL

We were friends.

ABNER

We are friends. And the fall, it's our second chance. We can forget our old hates, who we were.

GADREEL

It's not that easy.

ABNER

Yes, it is. Look at me. I'm happy.

GADREEL

And your vessel – is he happy?

ABNER

He was an abusive ass. But I love my family, and they love me. I'm not a wise man, Gadreel. But I know this. The key to happiness? It's getting the one thing you want most and never letting it go.

GADREEL

And what if there's a price?

ABNER

There's always a price. But it's worth paying.

[Scene changes to out in front of the house. DEAN and CASTIEL walk up and as DEAN walks by the IMPALA he run his hands over the car, making sure she is okay. DEAN walks into the house alone and sees ABNER with his throat slit on the floor. He then hears the kitchen water running and we see GADREEL washing blood off his hands in the sink.]

GADREEL [without turning around]

You should not have come here, Dean.

DEAN

You killed my friend, then you take my brother, and you think I'm gonna let that stand?

GADREEL

I allowed you to live.

DEAN

Mistake.

[DEAN lunges for GADREEL but he uses his angel force to knock DEAN back into a bookcase; knocking him unconscious. As GADREEL goes in for the kill he hears CASTIEL behind him. As he swings around CASTIEL delivers a knockout punch and GADREEL crumbles to the floor.]

ACT THREE
[Scene opens in CECILY's office as ABADDON paces back and forth in front of her desk]

ABADDON

So Crowley was here.

CECILY

Yeah, um, I thought you'd want to know.

ABADDON

You thought right. And now? Any idea where he scampered off to?

CECILY

Somerset, Pennsylvania, with Dean Winchester and the angel Castiel.

ABADDON

And you know this how?

CECILY

They're chasing an Impala. I helped them track it.

ABADDON

You helped Crowley?

CECILY

Yeah. I'm kind of playing both sides until someone w – until you win.

ABADDON

Hm.

CECILY

Smart, right?

ABADDON

No. [stabs her with an angel blade] Sort of the opposite.

[Scene switches to GADREEL, DEAN, CROWLEY and CASTIEL in an abandoned warehouse. GADREEL is tied to a chair with warded handcuffs and is in a chin and head restraint. GADREEL regains consciousness as the scene opens.]

DEAN

Welcome to the party, pal. Cas, how we lookin'?

CASTIEL

Most of Sam's internal burns have healed. I should be able to fix the rest.

What's your name? I thought I knew every angel in heaven, but I've never seen you.

GADREEL

Why would I tell you anything?

DEAN

Well, I don't give a damn who you are. You need to get out – now!

GADREEL

And if I don't?

CROWLEY

Then you and I will have a lovely little playdate.

GADREEL

Even bound, I can rip this body apart. Tell them, Castiel.

DEAN

You do, you die.

GADREEL

You want this to end? Go ahead. Put a blade through your brother's heart.

If it makes you feel better, I have Sam locked away in a dream. As far as he knows, the two of you are

working a case right now – something with ghouls and cheerleaders.

DEAN

Why are you doing this, huh? We fought together. And I trusted you. I thought you were one of the good guys!

GADREEL

I am doing what I have to do.

DEAN

Well, so am I.

[DEAN nods to CROWLEY who gets up and picks up a large thick needle from a tray and moves toward GADREEL.]

CROWLEY

So am I.

[CROWLEY sticks the needle into GADREEL's temple and starts to move it around. GADREEL screams in pain. DEAN's face hardens and he checks his watch. There is a small montage as we watch CROWLEY push more needles into the front of GADREEL's forehead and into his other temple. GADREEL's pained screams and groans fill the air. It becomes more evident that DEAN is having a hard time dealing with SAM's body being tortured. He finally walks suddenly away. CASTIEL, concerned, follows after him. He catches up to DEAN and we can see that DEAN is fighting desperately not to break down in tears.]

CASTIEL

Hey.

DEAN

I can't watch that anymore.

CASTIEL

I understand. It's not Sam, but... It's still Sam.

DEAN [voice cracking with emotion]

Pretty much, yeah. How are you doing?

CASTIEL [kind of surprised]

You want to talk about me now?

DEAN

I want to talk about anything that's not a demon sticking needles into my brother's brain.

[DEAN looks out a window trying to control his emotions but we see tears pooling in his eyes]

Yeah, humor me, man. How you doing?

CASTIEL

Uh... I'm okay.

DEAN

Good. Good. That's, uh... So, what, you just change the batteries out, power back up? It's that easy?

CASTIEL

It wasn't easy, but I didn't have a choice.

DEAN

Yeah. Well, that's usually how it goes.

Cas... I'm sorry.

CASTIEL

About what?

DEAN

Kickin' you out of the bunker. That's, uh... You know, not telling you about Sam.

CASTIEL

You thought his life was at stake.

DEAN

Yeah, I got played.

CASTIEL

I thought I was saving Heaven. I got played, too.

DEAN [with a weak smile]

So you're sayin' we're both a couple of dumbasses?

CASTIEL [gently smiling back]

I prefer the word "trusting." Less dumb. Less ass.

CROWLEY [from the other room]

Laverne! Shirley! Get in here!

[DEAN and CASTIEL rush back into the room]

CROWLEY

Pinhead's out cold, but watch this.

[CROWLEY moves two of the needles stuck in GADREEL's left temple. He sucks in a breath and starts to speak in Enochian.]

GADREEL

Zir noco iad Gadreel. Zir noco iad Gadreel.

DEAN

What's he saying?

CASTIEL

His name. Gadreel.

DEAN

Does that mean something to you?

CASTIEL

Well, it's why I've never seen him. He's been imprisoned since the dawn of time. Gadreel was the sentry who allowed Lucifer into the garden.

CROWLEY

My, my. A celebrity.

DEAN

Wait, the garden? Like eden? Adam and Eve? Fig-leaves garden?

CASTIEL

It's his fault – all of it. The corruption of man, demons, hell. God left because of him. The archangels –

the apocalypse. If he hadn't been so weak, none of it would have happened.

[CASTIEL gets white hot with anger and starts to shake the unconscious GADREEL]

You ruined the universe, you damn son of a bitch!

DEAN [grabs CASTIEL and swings him around to face him.]

Cas! Cas! Hey!

CASTIEL

Dean, he –

DEAN

I get it. But you got to chill.

[CROWLEY continues to probe needles into GADREEL's head. DEAN looks on]

DEAN

What's taking so long?

CROWLEY

Other than the fact that I'm trying to unravel a living, multidimensional knot of pure energy, not much.

[GADREEL gasps in a breath and opens his eyes. DEAN looks forward hoping it is SAM's consciousness that is speaking, but...]

GADREEL

It won't work. You will never find your brother. Go ahead. Poke and prod. I can sit in this chair for years and watch you fail over and over again. I've endured much worse than this, Dean. So...much...worse. And I have all the time in the world.

DEAN

Shut up! All right. Plan "B." Cas, you got to possess him.

CASTIEL

What?

DEAN

Do it now! Get in there, tell Sam what's going on, and help him kick that lying son of a bitch out!

CASTIEL

It might work. But I can't possess a vessel without permission.

[CROWLEY clears his throat and raises his hand as a volunteer]

DEAN

No. Not happening.

CROWLEY

Don't be daft. Demons can take what they want. I can burrow into that rat's nest of a head. I can wake Sam up. Just call me plan "C."

CASTIEL

You can't –

DEAN

...you got a better idea?

[to CROWLEY]

What about the angel?

CROWLEY

I'll work fast.

DEAN

And if he finds you?

CROWLEY

I'll run. I'm not dying for you lot. Of course, if I do this, you're gonna have to...

DEAN

Take off the leash. Yeah, I know.

CROWLEY

And it stays off. I save Sam, I leave here a free man. Do we have a deal?

DEAN

Cas, burn off Sam's tattoo.

CASTIEL

Dean.

DEAN

Do it. Do it.

[CASTIEL walks over to GADREEL and pulls down his shirt collar to reveal his warding tattoo. In a blaze of light, CASTIEL removes the tattoo.]

DEAN

If you mess with Sam, if you try anything –

CROWLEY

I keep my bargains. Besides, I don't want to be inside your brother any longer than I have to. I'm not one for sloppy seconds.

DEAN

When you find him, say "Poughkeepsie." It's our go word. It means "drop everything and run."

CROWLEY

Fine. While I'm gone, hands off the suit.

GADREEL [glaring at CROWLEY]

I will destroy you.

CROWLEY

Eat me.

[A cloud of red demon smoke shoots out of CROWLEY's mouth and rockets into GADREEL's mouth]

ACT FOUR
[DEAN and CASTIEL are waiting next to GADREEL's unconscious body. DEAN is pacing]

DEAN

A demon and an angel walk into my brother. Sounds like a bad joke.

CASTIEL

Dean, if this doesn't work...

DEAN [refusing to entertain the alternative]

It'll work.

[Scene changes to SAM working at the table in the bunker. He is flipping through a book trying to figure something out.]

SAM

I mean, it just doesn't make any sense. Why is this ghoul only chomping on dead cheerleaders?

DEAN [from the other room]

Hey, you want a beer?!

SAM

No, I'm fine.

CROWLEY [appearing]

Not bad.

SAM [jumping from his chair in shock]

Dean? Dean!

CROWLEY

Poughkeepsie.

SAM [still on the alert but curious]

How do you know that word?

CROWLEY

Because Dean's sent me, Bullwinkle, the real Dean. I'll make this quick – you've been possessed by an angel. He's got you packed away in some dusty corner of your own mind, and I'm here to break you out.

SAM [not believing a word of it]

Seriously?

CROWLEY

Fine. We'll do this the fun way.

[He picks up DEAN's gun from the table and shoots SAM full on in the chest. SAM shakes in shock but then realizes he is fine and not even bleeding.]

CROWLEY

See? Not real. Like I said. I know how possession works, Sam. You've seen everything that he's seen, even if you can't remember. That's what I need you to do. I need you to remember.

[SAM closes his eyes and tries and then is bombarded with memories from when GADREEL was in control. He sees himself in the hospital bed, slicing Demon Soldier throats, talking with DEAN in the courtyard and finally burning Kevin's eyes out with his own hand. His face crumbles as he puts the pieces together.]

SAM [heartbreakingly]

Did I kill Kevin?

CROWLEY

No, you didn't. He did. You need to take control, Sam. Blow it up and cast that punk-ass holy roller out!

[SAM looks up and sees GADREEL (in his old vessel form) standing behind CROWLEY]

CROWLEY

What? Oh, bollocks.

GADREEL

Hello, Sam.

SAM

Who are you?

CROWLEY

His name is Gadreel, the original chump.

GADREEL

Was a chump. And now? I'm going to be the one that leads my kind back to heaven. I'm going to be a hero. But you, demon, for all your chatter, you will always be a coward. You should be running.

[CROWLEY punches GADREEL in the face and GADREEL swings back hurling him over the table. GADREEL starts to kick him and SAM comes to his rescue only to be thrown backwards over the table himself. GADREEL straddles him and starts to strangle him.]

GADREEL

Give up, boy. You're not strong enough.

CROWLEY

Take control, Sam! Cast him out!

SAM [only gets a few words out before being choked]

Get out of my –

GADREEL

You sure you want me to go? Maybe I'm the only thing holding you together. I leave, you might die.

SAM [does a trick move and gets the upper hand. He stands and presses his foot down on GADREEL's neck]

SAM

I said get...the hell...Out!

[Immediately, white angel smoke leaves SAM's body in the warehouse as DEAN and CASTIEL dodge the brilliant light.

METATRON still sits at the bar now having drunk about four martinis. GADREEL's old vessel is still there tending the bar. He comes over to METATRON.]

BARTENDER

Waiting for someone?

METATRON

I am, and he's late.

[The building begins to shake, all the glass breaks and a brilliant light shines through the windows.]

BARTENDER

Yes.

[The white angel smoke shoves its way down the BARTENDER's throat. METATRON looks amused.]

METATRON

Let me guess. Winchester trouble?

[Red smoke flies out of SAM's mouth and into CROWLEY's body. SAM gasps and regains consciousness. DEAN and CASTIEL run to him.]

DEAN

Sam! Cas?

CROWLEY [all indignant]

I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

CASTIEL [removing the needles from SAM's head]

Sam, are you okay?

SAM

Cas?

[Headlights flash in the window and CASTIEL goes and checks it out as DEAN un-cuffs his brother.]

CASTIEL [looking out the window to see two stunt demons and ABADDON exit the car]

It's Abaddon.

CROWLEY

Go. The back door. I'll handle this.

DEAN

Oh, 'cause you're such a good guy?

CROWLEY

Right now, I'm the goodest guy you got.

DEAN

This don't make us square. I see you again –

CROWLEY

I'm dead. Yes, I know. I love you, too.

[DEAN and CASTIEL each grab one of SAM's arms and help him out the back door.

CROWLEY

Pleasure doing business with you boys, as always.

[CROWLEY sits down in the chair SAM just vacated as ABADDON and her stunt demons enter. He swivels around slowly]

Hello, darling.

ACT FIVE
[In the warehouse. CROWLEY, ABADDON and the two stunt demons]

ABADDON

Crowley.

[To her demons]

Bring me his head. [They hesitate]

CROWLEY [smirking]

See, that's the thing about demons. They're only obedient to a point. Right. Let's have a chat.

ABADDON

I'm not here to talk.

CROWLEY

And I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to them, the average demon, because I feel their pain. It must have been difficult, with your loving king so cruelly taken from you. I imagine you felt all at sea. And then along came...The brute. [He motions to ABADDON] She's strong...and a knight and immortal – at the moment. So I'm not surprised that some of my more idiotic subjects bought her line. But now? Good news, fellas.

[CROWLEY stands]

Daddy's home.

ABADDON

Hell doesn't want you, Crowley. It's mine.

CROWLEY

Is it? Not what I hear. Not while I'm still kicking.

ABADDON

Well, then, let's settle it. You and me. Right here. Winner takes the crown.

CROWLEY

See, that's your problem, love. You think this is a fight.

ABADDON

It's not?

CROWLEY

It's a campaign. Hearts and minds, that's what's important. See, the demons have a choice – take orders from the world's angriest ginger – and that's saying something – or join my team, where everyone gets a say, a virgin, and all the entrails they can eat.

So, think on this, lads. Spread the word – vote Crowley.

[CROWLEY snaps his fingers and disappears]

[CASTIEL, SAM and DEAN are on a long dock in the pouring rain. CASTIEL slowly moves his hand over SAM's head healing all the stab wounds from the needles. SAM sways unsteadily.]

CASTIEL

You feel better?

SAM

A little, yeah.

CASTIEL

It'll take time to fully heal you. We'll have to do it in stages.

[SAM nods in agreement but keeps looking unsteadily at his older brother. DEAN approaches with reservation. CASTIEL backs away to a respectful distance.]

DEAN

All right. Let me hear it.

SAM

What you do want me to say – that I'm pissed? Okay. I am. I'm pissed.

You lied to me. Again.

DEAN

I didn't have a choice.

SAM [emotion clouding his voice]

I was ready to die, Dean!

DEAN

I know. But I wouldn't let you, because that's not in me.

SAM

So, what? You decide to trick me into being possessed by some... psycho angel?

DEAN

He saved your life.

SAM

So what? I was willing to die.

And now... Kevin... [His eyes fill with guilty tears]

DEAN [strongly]

No. That is not on you. Kevin's blood is on my hands, and that ain't ever getting clean. I'll burn for that. I will. But I'll find Gadreel. And I will end that son of a bitch.

But I'll do it alone.

SAM

What's that supposed to mean?

DEAN

Come on, man. Can't you see? I'm... I'm poison, Sam. People get close to me, they get killed...or worse.

You know, I tell myself that I-I – I help more people than I hurt. And I tell myself that I'm – I'm doing it all

for the right reasons, and I – I believe that. But I can't – I won't... Drag anybody through the muck with me. Not anymore.

[DEAN looks pleadingly at his brother]

SAM

Go. I'm not gonna stop you.

[DEAN's face falls in defeat and surrender and after shooting CASTIEL a glace he slowly turns to walk away.]

SAM

But don't go thinking that's the problem, 'cause it's not.

DEAN [pausing but not turning back around]

What's that supposed to mean?

SAM

Just go.

[DEAN slowly walks to the IMPALA as CASTIEL comes back to stand with SAM. DEAN unlocks the car and slowly climbs in. He drives away leaving his brother and the angel in the rain.]
