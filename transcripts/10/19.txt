Teaser
St. Louis, Missouri -- 1973 [We see a white house. A paperboy rides past on his bike and tosses the newspaper. Cut to the interior of the house. A teen-aged girl (Suzie) is laying on the couch watching TV when her teen-aged brother (Brad) walks in and shuts off the TV.]
SUZIE

Hey!

BRAD

Get lost.

SUZIE

My show just started. You have a record player in your room.

BRAD

Dad’s speakers are better.

SUZIE

Tough luck. [She turns the TV back on. Then her mom enters with a basket of laundry.]

MOM

I need the laundry started. The workmen have finally left for the day and I have my hands full with dinner. [She turns off the TV.] And please, none of your Betty Friedan stuff.

SUZIE

It’s not fair. [Her brother puts the album on the record player.] Look, I always get stuck with the hard chores just ‘cause I’m a girl.

MOM

Yeah? Well, tough luck. [Suzie carries the laundry past her Dad’s home office where he is on the phone.]

DAD

The house is great, Ted. It’s a bit of a fixer, but it’s a real beaut. It was caught in some ownership muddle for years but finally hit the market, and I leapt.

[“I Saw the Light” by Todd Rundgren begins to play. The Dad closes his office door. Suzie passes her Mom in the kitchen and goes down the basement stairs to the washer and dryer. She then walks over to a tool box and takes a sledgehammer.]

MOTHERS VOICE

Don’t spend all day down there. [Suzie begins hammering until she has made a large hole in a wall that reveals a large box that looks like a safe. She steps through the hole and goes to the box. When she tries to open it, she is knocked backwards by some force. As Suzie is lying unconscious on the floor, green smoke comes out of the box and floats upstairs. Suzie wakes up and goes upstairs. The food is burning in a frying pan on the stove in the empty kitchen.]

SUZIE

Mom? [She walks to her father’s office and enters.] Dad, where’s Mom? [She sees her father laying on the floor dead. There’s a gun laying near him and a large puddle of blood coming from a gunshot wound in his head. She runs into the living room.] Mom? Brad? [She then sees her brother has hung himself in the hallway.] Aah! [She runs back into the kitchen and sees her Mom.] Mom? Mom!

MOM

Everything’s gonna be okay. [Suzie runs to her Mom and is on her knees hugging her.] Everythings… [Suzie’s Mom grabs a knife.] Gonna be just fine. [Her Mom slices her own throat.]

SUPERNATURAL TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
[Interior of a bar/restaurant. Sam and Rowena are sitting at a table.]

ROWENA

There’s only one thing you could possibly do for me that I can’t, at least presently, do for myself. Kill my son. He’s expecting it from me. Already has his stinking minions on high alert. And if you’re wondering how a mother can get to the point of wanting her own son –

SAM

No, I’m really not. I’ll do it. I’ll kill Crowley. First things first – can you read the book?

ROWENA

Of course I can. I’m likely the only witch alive who can understand such old, dark magic. Just not in its present form.

SAM

Drink’s on me. [He closes the lockbox with the book inside.]

ROWENA

Hey, you’re not going anywhere, pal. I’m your mortal enemy. I’ve tried to kill you and your brother – your brother as recently as last month. You wouldn’t have come to me if I wasn’t your last resort. You’re desperate. You can stop pretending you’re not. [Sam’s cell phone buzzes and he takes it out of his pocket.] So rude. [Sam reads a text message from Dean “Hitting a nest in Tulsa. Join if you want.”] Now, I can’t read the book in its present form, but there is someone who could. Nadya. Grand Coven witch.

SAM

Where do I find her?

ROWENA

You don’t. She’s dead. Long ago. Murdered for her life’s work. Her decryption formulas, her codex… That you can find. Bring me Nadya’s codex, and I’ll… break this text right open and give you your cure.

SAM

Where do I look?

ROWENA

If I were you, I’d start at home. Who do you think murdered Nadya and stoke the codex in the first place?

SAM

The Men of Letters.

[Interior of a trailer. Dean decapitates a vampire. He looks around and there are other decapitated bodies. He exits the trailer and is washing his machete in a barrel of water. He then washes his hands. He opens a refrigerator and grabs a can of beer.]

DEAN

Ha ha! Jackpot. [Sam runs up to Dean with his machete.]

SAM

Dean!

DEAN

Hey.

SAM

Hey. What happened? What is this?

DEAN

I know, right? Six vamps. Solo. I think that’s gotta be a personal best.

SAM

You couldn’t have waited?

DEAN

For what?

SAM

For what?

DEAN

Oh, come on, man. I can handle it. I did handle it.

SAM

What if you couldn’t?

DEAN

But I did. It’s done. Come on, man. It’s the only way I can take the edge off. I’m sorry. I don’t always like to wait around for you, especially with you looking at me like that all the time.

SAM

Look at you like what?

DEAN

Like that. Like I’m some sort of a-a-a diseased killer puppy. You know what, man? I’m sweaty and I’m covered in vamp juice. Can we just talk about this later? I’d like to get back to the bunker, get my buzz on, and, uh, you know, pass out watching “Speed 2 – Cruise Control.” We cool?

SAM

Cool.

[Interior of Dean’s bedroom in the Men of Letters bunker. He’s asleep in bed with headphones on. Sam looks in the doorway at him and walks away. He rushes to the library and begins looking in the catalogs. He takes an envelope from the files and removes an audio tape reel. He puts on headphones and listens to the tape.

VOICE ON TAPE (Markham’s voice)

Please lets come to order. Men of Letters meeting minutes – May 16, 1956. On the matter of Cuthbert Sinclair expulsion. This is hardly your first offense, Cuthbert.

[Cut to 1956 Men of Letters meeting. The Men of Letters are sitting around a table in the library while the reel-to-reel tape deck records.]

MARKHAM

You’ve been cited for disciplinary infractions seven times in the course of your tenure. This… enchanted vault of yours, this…. Werther box. A warding so potent it achieves a theoretical rate of… in your own words, 98% lethality.

CUTHBERT

Extreme measures were warranted. The Coven’s desperate to get the codex back. The Werther box works.

MARKHAM

All too well, I’d say. Working in secret, embarking on this project without oversight… you left two fellow Men of Letters vulnerable to your most potent magics. Fletcher and Martinez were members in good standing. Fletcher chanced upon the box and died in two hours. Martinez heroically tried to shut it down. We found him dead on the floor beside the box, his wrists cut.

CUTHBERT

I already apologized for that accident. I refuse to do so again. Why are you all so small-minded? Hmm? We were brought here to do great things. To take risks, to bring the fight to the monsters of this world. And yet, to a man, you choose instead to molder in these stacks. You are not men. You are NOT men. You’re librarians, nothing more.

MARKHAM

Before we rule on what is to be done with you, I’m prepared to give you a chance to secure our leniency. Tell us how to shut it down. The box is still in St. Louis with the codex. It’s still a danger.

CUTHBERT

Let me tell you what you can do with your leniency, Markham. You know, I saw the writing on the wall. I knew you cowards would shut this project down, which is why I built it the way I did. There is only one way to silence the Werther for good. Let’s just say Martinez was on the right track. I doubt you lot have the guts, but you’re welcome to die trying. [Cuthbert exits with two Men of Letters following him out.]

MEN OF LETTERS MEMBER

Markham, would you have us keep trying?

MARKHAM

The box is to be interred and guarded where it stands, in perpetuity. Bury it.

[Cut back to present with Sam shutting off the tape in the Men of Letters Library. He grabs a book off the shelf and flips to the page with the address for the Men of Letters headquarters in St. Louis. He writes the address on a notepad.]

[Cut to Rowena sleeping in a bed. A phone is ringing. She wakes up and pulls the cell phone out from under a pillow.]

ROWENA

It’s a bit early. [She turns over the phone and takes the call.] I’m over 300 years old. Beauty sleep isn’t optional.

SAM

[Cut to Sam in the MOL bunker.] I’ve been looking into the, uh, thing we discussed. So, I got a lead, but it’s guarded by a violent enchantment. I need a spell to…. break the spell.

ROWENA

[Cut to Rowena sitting up in her bed.] The Cabirian invocation. Easy to obtain. Good all-purpose disenchantment.

SAM

[Cut to Sam in MOL bunker.] Great. Thanks.

ROWENA

[Cut to Rowena in her bedroom.] Uh, but….It’s not recommended for amateurs. In inexperienced hands, the invocation has a way of fizzling out. I could come. You might need me.

SAM

[Cut to Sam in MOL bunker.] I’ll take my chances. Thanks. [Sam hangs up.]

ACT TWO
[Cut to Exterior of the white house. The grounds are overgrown and the house is in disarray. Sam walks up to the front door. There’s a pile of newspapers on the porch. Sam peers in the window and takes out his lock-pick. Someone is watching him from inside. He begins to pick the lock and a shotgun is shoved out the mail slot, aimed at his crotch.]

SAM

Whoa!

SUZIE

Bad idea.

SAM

I-I can explain.

SUZIE

Yeah, don’t bother. You got three choices – get arrested, get your bits blown off, or get back.

SAM

Yeah, alright. I think I’ll, uh, think I’ll get back. Sorry. [Sam backs up from the door.]

SUZIE

Attaboy

SAM

Yeah. [Sam heads down the stairs and gets back in his car. He shuts his door. The passenger door opens and Dean gets in.]

DEAN

Hey ya, Sammy. How’s the case?

SAM

What are you doing here?

DEAN

Well it looks like I, uh, I’m here to save your sack. Look, you were right, okay? I shouldn’t have gone off solo like I did. It was stupid.

SAM

And?

DEAN

And selfish. It was a douche move. If you’re doing this case by yourself to teach me a lesson, you don’t have to, okay?

SAM

How’d you find me?

DEAN

Ah. I, uh, took an etching off your notepad. Then I decided to take a crack at the St. Louis suicide house.

SAM

So you know about it?

DEAN

I got the basics from Google. The family moves into a long-vacant house. Uh, one week later, three of ‘em dead by their own hands. Whole family wiped out except for the daughter, which the house is still under her name. I’m figuring she’s the one who nearly unmanned you back there. But see, here’s what I don’t get. A cold case is one thing, but…. this is subzero. I mean, there’s nothing even in our wheelhouse, unless you know something I don’t.

SAM

Yeah. Um…. That long-vacant home used to be a Men of Letters chapter house. Remember Magnus?

DEAN

You mean the dickwad ex-Men of Letters that tried to make a zoo exhibit out of me? Yeah.

SAM

Before he was expelled, he built Werther, a magical box with a deadly alarm system. Werther is buried somewhere in that house. It was supposed to have been guarded, but I’m guessing that plan went out the window when Abaddon massacred the entire membership in ’58.

DEAN

And then the house stayed in limbo until some lucky family bought it.

SAM

Werther’s a time bomb and it needs to be defused. Not only is this in our wheelhouse, it’s our responsibility.

DEAN

Our responsibility?

SAM

We’re Men of Letters. It’s our legacy.

DEAN

Well, hey, if you say this is a case, I’m in, if you’ll have me.

[Dean walks up to the front door and knocks. He looks at the mail slot and covers his crotch with his hands. Suzie opens the door aiming a gun at him.]

SUZIE

What did I say?

DEAN

I, aah!

SUZIE

You’re not…. Fella tried to…. What do you want?

DEAN

You saw him? Oh, tell me you did. I’m sorry, but my name is Dwight Twilley. I’m with the neighborhood watch. We’re – we’re looking into a few recent break-ins. And if you saw the guy and you – you could give a description, it would be mighty helpful. If I could – if I could just have a minute of your time? [Dean steps into the house.]

SUZIE

Uh, tall, white fella.

DEAN

Uh, huh.

SUZIE

Pretty hair.

DEAN

Mm-hmm.

[Cut to exterior of the house. Sam picks the lock on the back door.]

[Cut to the interior of the house where Dean and Suzie are standing.]

DEAN

It’s a nice house you have here, uh….

SUZIE

Suzie.

DEAN

Suzie. You live alone?

SUZIE

Just me and Gus.

DEAN

Gus? [Suzie raises up her gun. We see Sam enter the kitchen through the back door. Then the kettle begins to whistle and Suzie heads for the kitchen followed by Dean. Sam is now hiding in the hall outside the kitchen. Suzie turns off the kettle. Dean signals Sam to go and Sam begins picking the lock on the basement door.] So, all alone in this big house, huh? Must get lonely, even with, uh, Gus.

SUZIE

Yeah, well I’m used to alone. [She offers Dean a cup of tea.]

DEAN

No, no. I’m fine, thanks. [Sam enters the basement door. He turns on his flashlight and goes down the steps. He sees a pile of furniture by a wall.]

[Cut to the kitchen]

SUZIE

Been alone here since…. uh, ’80? After my family died, my Aunt Pauline moved in. She took care of me, raised me for a few years. Then, well….

[Cut to the basement. Sam begins moving the furniture and makes some noise.]

DEAN

[Cut to the kitchen.] So, uh, what—what happened? To your aunt?

SUZIE

Well…. I told her not to go in the basement. No one goes in the basement.

[Cut to the basement. Sam goes through the hole to the Werther box.]

DEAN

[Cut to the kitchen.] What’s in the basement, Suzie? Ma’am you okay?

[Cut to Sam in the basement putting ingredients for a spell in a bowl.]

[Cut to the kitchen. Suzie pulls a gun on Dean.]

DEAN

Oh! Whoa! Suzie!

SUZIE

My social skills may be rusty, but I’m no idiot. Doorbell hasn’t rung in months, and two visitors in one hour? One breaking in, and the other asking all sorts of questions about….

DEAN

I told you, I was from the neighborhood watch. I –

SUZIE

Yeah, yeah, neighborhood watch. Right. Boy, you seen this house? There’s only one thing in here worth getting at, and it sure as hell ain’t me. You came for the box.

[Cut to the basement. The ingredients in the bowl are on fire.]

SAM

Purificare la magia.

[Cut to the kitchen.]

SUZIE

Whoever left that Godforsaken thing down there…. I knew someday, someone would come for it. I swore never to let that happen. He’s downstairs isn’t – isn’t he?

DEAN

He’s my brother. And we’re here to help you.

SUZIE

You call him up here. Now! You call him up here! Now!

DEAN

Sam! Sammy!

[Cut to the basement.]

SAM

Purificare la magia.

[Cut to the kitchen.]

DEAN

She wants you up here, now!

[Cut to the basement. Sam turns the handle on the box.]

[Cut to the kitchen.]

SUZIE

No! No! Get out! Get out! Out! Out! You bastards!

DEAN

[Heading toward the front door.] Okay. Okay

SUZIE

You let it out! [The green smoke comes up from the basement. It enters Suzie’s eyes and Dean’s eyes. Sam runs up from the basement.]

SAM

Dean! [Suzie aims her gun at Sam.] Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

SUZIE

You have any idea what you’ve done?

SAM

Put the gun down. We can talk about this, okay? [The ghost of Suzie’s brother appears behind Sam and Dean.]

SUZIE

What’s that?

BRAD

Hey Suzie, you miss me?

SUZIE

Oh, my God.

DEAN

What’s wrong with her?

SAM

I don’t know.

SUZIE

Stay back. Stay back! [She aims the gun at her brother.]

DEAN

Go. [Sam and Dean run out of the room.]

BRAD

Come on, Suze. That any way to treat your family? [Suzie shoots at the ghost of her brother and backs into the kitchen. She sees the ghost of her mother.]

MOTHER

Hello Suzie.

SUZIE

Oh!

DEAN

What are you doing, huh? You don’t have a plan. You don’t have a defense. [Suzie runs into the office and sees the ghost of her father.]

FATHER.

You did this to us. [The ghost of her mother appears.]

MOTHER

You let it out. [The ghost of her brother appears.]

BRAD

We died while you slept.

[Cut to the living room where Sam and Dean are standing.]

SUZIE’S VOICE

No!

SAM

Suzie! [He runs toward the office. Dean suddenly turns and walks the other way. He steps and it seems like he’s outdoors yet he’s still in the living room. Sam goes down the hall.] Susie? [He comes to the locked door of the office and hears her voice.]

SUZIE’S VOICE

Please! No! Stop! No! [He knocks at the door.]

SAM

Suzie! Suzie, let me in! I can help you!

[Cut to the interior of the office.]

SUZIE

Stop!

SAM’S VOICE

Suzie, it’s not real!

MOTHER

You don’t have to be sad. And you don’t have to be alone.

SAM’S VOICE

Suzie, please!

MOTHER

Not anymore.

SAM’S VOICE

Suzie! Hey, let me in. I can help you, okay?

SUZIE

Oh, please, no.

SAM

Suzie? Dean!

[Dean takes a few steps and he’s in Purgatory.]

DEAN

Sam?

[Cut to office door. Sam hears a shot and the door opens.]

SAM

Suzie? [Sam enters the office and sees that Suzie has shot and killed herself.]

[Cut to Dean in Purgatory.]

DEAN

Crap.

[Cut to the office in Suzie’s house. Sam turns around and sees the ghost of Suzie.]

SUZIE

Boo. Survived 40 years in this house, keeping that thing on lockdown, and one visit from a putz like you….

SAM

I’m sorry, okay? I’m so sorry.

SUZIE

Lot of good “sorry” does me. Look at me. Look….at….me. [She points to her corpse.] There she is. The first casualty of your misguided mission. But what’s another human life to you? Anything’s worth it, as long as you two make it out alive. And how’s that search going? Any closer to a cure?

SAM

This isn’t real. You’re not real.

SUZIE

You think Dean’s the wild card, the loose cannon. But don’t you see? Making deals with witches, opening Pandora’s box down there? You’re the reckless one. You’ll do anything to keep clinging to that doomed brother of yours. How many more will die, Sammy? You know it. You have to be stopped. And the only one who can stop you is you! Do it, Sammy! End this farce once and for all! [She directs him toward the gun.]

ROWENA

[Rowena appears in the doorway.] Vanesce! [The ghost of Suzie disappears.] Told you you’d need me.

ACT THREE
SAM

How did you find me?

ROWENA

Same way I just saved you – magic. Had a feeling you might be in over your head.

SAM

Yeah, well you can’t be here. If Dean sees you…. [Sam heads to the living room where Dean is.] Dean!

DEAN

Sam! [Dean still thinks he’s in Purgatory.]

SAM

Hey, Dean. What are you doing? [Dean is walking through Purgatory and is attacked by a Leviathan. Benny appears and cuts the Leviathan’s head off.]

BENNY

Hey, chief.

[Cut to Dean standing in the living room.]

DEAN

No, no, it can’t be you.

SAM

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. [Sam claps his hands.] Wake up! Dean, whatever you’re seeing, it’s not real.

ROWENA

[She enters the living room.] Real enough to him.

SAM

What are you doing?

ROWENA

He can’t see me, Sam. Yeah, he’s too far gone.

SAM

Can you wake him up?

ROWENA

I only brought enough dispelling magic for one. Maybe if you’d told me we’d have company…

SAM

There is no we.

ROWENA

Fine, take this all on by yourself. But the odds are totally stacked against you.

DEAN

You’re not real.

ROWENA

Oh, the spell’s got its hooks in deep. If you want him woken up… You’re gonna have to rip this enchantment out by the root.

SAM

The box! If we can figure out the fail-safe, we can break the spell and get the codex. Suzie’s hallucinations drove her to suicide. Same thing happened to her family. Werther’s illusions tried to do the same thing to me.

ROWENA

And so?

SAM

So I can’t leave Dean alone like this.

ROWENA

Well then, we’ll just have to tie up the bonny lad. Could be fun.

[Cut to Purgatory.]

BENNY

Come on, Dean. How long you gonna keep this up? The silent treatment for me? We got so much to catch up on.

DEAN

Hey, look, it’s good to see you, okay? It is. But like I said, you ain’t Benny.

BENNY

I’m not? Well, shoot.

DEAN

Hey, I’m bummed out too, but you are just a figment, okay? You’re – you’re subconscious junk my brain’s throwing up to distract me from getting back to reality.

BENNY

Figment? Junk? Well, I’ll try not to be offended. Why not trust me? I’ve gotten you outta here before. Besides, if all I am is your subconscious junk, well, then how can I lead you wrong? Well, how about that? A perfect circle. Don’t look at me, chief. You chose the way.

[Cut to Dean tied to a chair in Suzie’s house.]

[Cut to the basement.]

SAM

Here it is. There’s some kind of inscription.

ROWENA

It’s some kind of cursive, but the light source has dimmed. I know what I’ve said about your kind, but…oh, the man who came up with this? The craftsmanship of the box, the sadism of the spellwork…it’s all so… deliciously baroque.

SAM

Alright, come on.

ROWENA

Illumnia…

[Cut to Purgatory. Dean and Benny are walking and they end up at the same tree again.]

BENNY

Well, now that is just creepy.

DEAN

Benny, whoever you are, I need to get out of here.

BENNY

“Need” and “Want” are just two different things, ain’t they? It’s all a figment, right? You, me, left right. But no matter which way you turn, you keep ending up here. You gotta wonder—why this figment? Why this place?

DEAN

What are you saying?

BENNY

Nothing you don’t already know. This is where you wanna be – you’re happy place. And you don’t really wanna leave.

[Cut to the basement.]

ROWENA

Arcam confutare…

SAM

To silence the box…

ROWENA

Mmm. Sitim restinguere…

SAM

Slake its thirst.

ROWENA

Sanguine nostrum…

SAM

With…the blood of our own.

ROWENA

That’s it? The blood of its own…What?

SAM

The blood of our own. Men of Letters blood. Legacy blood. My blood.

ROWENA

Oh.

[Cut to Purgatory.]

BENNY

Remember what you said to me when we first met? About the purity of this place? Dean, slow down. Dean, stop. Listen. This…. This place you don’t have to go looking for a fight. All you have to do is be still for one moment, and that fight will come to you. That’s why you’re here, Dean. That’s the purity you crave – killing with no consequence.

DEAN

No, Benny. I don’t wanna fight anymore. I’m tired of fighting.

BENNY

The Mark ain’t. So, can’t leave, don’t wanna stay, bit of a bind ain’t it? Good thing there’s always a third way out. You can’t say you haven’t been thinking about it.

DEAN

That ain’t gonna happen, ever.

BENNY

Come on, Dean. I know you can see it. The purity, the honor.

DEAN

There’s no honor in that.

BENNY

What., you just wanna wait for the Mark to reclaim you? Go out swinging, die topside, then what? Maybe kill a few humans? Kill Cas? Kill your brother? Yeah, that’s mighty honorable!

DEAN

Benny, shut up!

BENNY

Oh, I-I’m sorry. I forgot… about your plan. You gonna get Sam and Cas to put you down? You really think that they’re gonna keep that agreement? Come on. Dean, let’s say they do. Do you think they will ever recover from that? It will ruin them. This little backup plan of yours, I know you’ve been thinking about it for a time, I know it’s been gnawin’ at you. You can’t leave that job to them.

DEAN

You’re right. [Cut to Suzie’s house. Dean breaks the ropes binding his hands to the chair.]

[Cut to Purgatory.]

BENNY

Out there? You’re sleeping. You make the right choice in here, you’ll sleep forever, and you won’t ever hurt anyone ever again. No one needs to know, Dean. What happens in Purgatory stays in Purgatory. [Benny hands Dean his Purgatory weapon.]

[Cut to Suzie’s house. Dean picks up a bottle and smashes it on a dresser.]

[Cut to the basement. Sam pulls out a knife.]

ROWENA

How do you know this will work?

SAM

I don’t. [He cuts his wrist with the knife and lets the blood drip into a bowl. The tumblers in the Werther box begin to turn.]

ROWENA

It’s working.

[Cut to Dean holding the bottle in Suzie’s house.]

[Cut to Dean in Purgatory.]

DEAN

I always did love it here. It’s as good a place as any to call it a day, huh?

[Cut to Dean holding the jagged bottle in Suzie’s house.]

[Cut to the basement.]

ROWENA

Slow down.

SAM

Right, okay. [The tumblers in the Werther box stop.] No, no, no.

ROWENA

It wants more, Sam. It wants it all.

SAM

The codex… path to the cure. It's in there. If it wants more, it’ll get more. [Sam cuts his other wrist with the knife. The tumblers begin turning again.]]

[Cut to Purgatory.]

DEAN

I’d do it. If I really had to, I would. But the real Benny, would never let me.

BENNY

We already covered that, chief. It’s not me.

DEAN

You know what else won’t let me? This thing on my arm. For better or worse, the Mark… it wants me alive. [Dean stabs Benny with the Purgatory weapon.] Thanks, pal, but no thanks. [Benny disappears. Dean turns around and he’s back in Suzie’s house. He puts down the broken bottle.]

[Cut to the basement. Sam appears to be ready to pass out from losing so much blood.]

ROWENA

It’s opening, Sammy! It’s nearly there. [Dean runs down the basement stairs to Sam.]

DEAN

Sam! Hey! Hey, Hey. Sammy, whatever you’re seeing, it’s – it’s a trick. Okay? It’s not real!

SAM

Dean?

DEAN

Yeah. [Sam seems to collapse.] Hey No. [Dean slaps Sam.] No. Hey! Hey!

SAM

Get away from me! [He raises his knife. Dean take the knife from him.] No, don’t! Don’t! It’s the only way. It needs legacy blood. Enough to take a life. [Dean begins wrapping Sam’s wounds.]

DEAN

Yeah, well… it doesn’t have to come from just one legacy, does it?

SAM

Uhh.

DEAN

It needs more blood, it can have mine. [Dean take the knife and cuts his wrist. He drips his blood in the bowl and the tumblers turn and the box opens.]

ROWENA

Oh, well. [She turns to green smoke and disappears. Dean turns the knob and opens the box. He removes the codex and closes the box.]

ACT FOUR
[Cut to Sam in the Impala reading the codex. Dean is walking toward the car with a sledgehammer. He puts it in the trunk.]

SAM

Overkill, don’t you think? I mean, we broke the spell. The box is just a box.

DEAN

Well, now it’s scrap metal. You okay?

SAM

Yeah, I’m great.

DEAN

You road ready?

SAM

I’ll be fine.

DEAN

That says something, doesn’t it? Werther splits us up in there. Within an hour, we’re both on the brink of death. Sorry about yesterday, going rogue on you like that.

SAM

You know what, Dean? Don’t apologize. I… I think that makes us even.

DEAN

The universe is trying to tell us something we both should already know. We’re stronger together than apart.

SAM

Mmh.

DEAN

Now what could possibly be so valuable, that it takes a spell that nasty to protect it, huh? [Dean gets in the driver’s seat of the Impala.]

SAM

No idea. But whatever it is, we’ll keep it safe. [Dean starts the Impala.]

[Interior of another room.]

ROWENA

Well hello, cowboy. Oh, you’ve got it. Oh! [Rowena begins turning pages of the codex.]

SAM

Is it enough?

ROWENA

To what?

SAM

To translate the book? To find a cure for the Mark.

ROWENA

Oh, aye.

SAM

Good. [Sam’s puts shackles on Rowena.]

ROWENA

What in the hell is this?

SAM

Insurance. Comfortable?

ROWENA

We had an ageeement, giant.

SAM

The agreement stands. You will decrypt the Book of the Damned and find me a cure for my brother. And that is all you will get from the book. I’ll burn the book, and then I’ll kill Crowley. But until then…

ROWENA

I’m your slave? You can’t—you can’t just leave me here.
