TEASER
INT. GARAGE

Chester, Pennsylvania

(A man is in his garage, he props up the door with a plank. He works on a bent piece of metal.)

MAN: Piece of crap.

(He goes to grab his beer which isn't where he left it. As he takes it off the table behind him, he knocks over a glass of nails.)

MAN: Oh, damn it.

(He gets a broom to sweep up the nails and unknowingly knocks over a skateboard. He then slips on the skateboard, almost impales himself on a pair of garden shears, and accidentally knocks over a bucket of golf balls. He slips on one and falls, landing with his head directly underneath the garage door. A stray golf ball bounces onto a mouse trap, which goes off and causes the golf ball to fly towards the plank propping up the garage door. The plank falls and the garage door comes down on the man's neck, decapitating him.)

ACT I
INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE

(Bobby sits at his desk drinking alcohol. Sam and Dean watch him from the door to the kitchen.)

SAM: (whispers) Say something.

DEAN: (whispers) No. You.

SAM: (whispers) No. You.

(They play rock-paper-scissors. Sam picks paper. Dean picks scissors, as always. Sam looks stunned.)

SAM: (clears throat) Uh...

BOBBY: You two just gonna stand there like the ugly girl at the prom, or you gonna pitch in? This so-called Eve, mother of whatever, ain't gonna gank herself. What's wrong with you two?

DEAN: Bobby, you haven't slept in days.

BOBBY: I sleep. What are you, my wife now?

DEAN: I'm just saying that, you know, taking five might be a good thing.

BOBBY: For whom?

SAM: Look, Bobby, it was – it was tough for all of us, seeing Rufus go like that.

BOBBY: You think this—? This ain't about Rufus.

DEAN: Bobby, he wasn't just a poker buddy.

BOBBY: You know when I knew Rufus was done for? The day I met him. The only question was, who first – him or me? Now, you want to stand there and therapise, or you want to get me some coffee? (Sam & Dean exchange a look) Make it Irish.

(Sam & Dean walk out)

DEAN: Well, he's doing fantastic.

SAM: Yeah, this isn't about Rufus at all.

DEAN: Well, what do you want to do? I mean, we can't just sit here and watch him poop out his liver.

SAM: Well, we could get him out of the house. There's a job.

DEAN: Really? What've you got?

SAM: (pulls a newspaper clipping out of his jacket pocket) Look. Chester, Pennsylvania. Three people got kicked off in the last week, all freaky. Last guy got karate-chopped by his garage door. And these are all blood relatives.

DEAN: What are you thinking, family curse?

SAM: Could be.

DEAN: Hey, grumpy – (Dean yells to Bobby, who has walked up behind them) You, uh—?

BOBBY: I don't want to do crap. Leave me alone. Just, get out of my house, both of you. You're driving me nuts.

DEAN: Bobby.

BOBBY: Now! For the love of Pete.

(Sam takes the newspaper clipping back from Dean)

EXT. BOBBY'S SCRAPYARD

(Sam & Dean walk to their car, which is not the Impala. It has her plates, but it's a black Mustang with two brown stripes. Dean puts his bag in through the window and they get in. Dean starts the car.)

SAM: You know, maybe we should wait 'til she gets back.

DEAN: Dude, she just called from the road, said she'd be here in two shakes. You really want to sit around and smell him stew in his juices?

SAM: Yeah, yeah. Drive.

(They drive off.)


INT. BOBBY'S KITCHEN

(Bobby pours himself another drink, and finds a shotgun moving his hand away from the glass.)

BOBBY: What the...?

ELLEN: Tell me you haven't been drinking this whole time. 

BOBBY: You're worse than the boys. I'm working.

ELLEN: My God. I'm gone a week, and this place goes completely to hell. What is wrong with you, Bobby Singer?

BOBBY: Get a pen. It's a long list.

ELLEN: You smell like a bar, you know that?

BOBBY: You don't exactly smell like a rose yourself.

ELLEN: Huh. Yeah, I've been hunting with Jo. What's your excuse?

(Ellen unpacks groceries.)

BOBBY: If I need one, I got a good one.

ELLEN: I know. And I'm so sorry. He meant a lot to me, too. Go wash up. I'll fix us something. (She pats Bobby on the arm.)

BOBBY: Anybody ever tell you you're a pain in the ass?

ELLEN: (laughs and kisses Bobby on the cheek) That's why you married me. (Ellen pushes Bobby gently) Go.

(Bobby walks out)

BOBBY: Don't tell me what to do, Ellen.


INT. GARAGE 

Chester, Pennsylvania

(Dean and Sam investigate the scene. They both look around with flashlights.)

DEAN: (turns on the EMF meter) Not a bleep.

SAM: Well, not a vengeful spirit, then. So what is it? (Sam finds a golden thread on the floor.) Huh.

DEAN: Whatcha got? What is that, Christmas tinsel?

SAM: I don't know. (Sam rubs the thread against a flower pot, it leaves a gold streak.) It's gold.

DEAN: You mean, like, gold gold?

SAM: Why would a handyman have gold just lying around in his garage?

DEAN: I don't know. There is definitely a skeleton in this family's closet. I mean, accidents don't just happen accidentally. (Sam gives Dean a look.) You know what I mean.

SAM: All right. How about I'll go check family records, you go with next of kin?

DEAN: Yeah.

INT. RUSSO'S OFFICE

RUSSO: (on the phone) On the courthouse steps – for the deposition. No, I told you, 3:00 p.m. No, my usual fees. I got to go, Ma. (Russo hangs up the phone and turns to Dean. Dean closes the pamphlet he was reading.) I'm sorry, uh, what department?

DEAN: Genealogy. From the university. W-w-we're doing a study on local families, and, well, the Russos are -

RUSSO: Yeah, well, you know what? I got to tell you, I am extremely busy right now, so -

DEAN: Yeah, I-I'm sure you've had a rough week. I, uh, read about the recent tragedies. Your cousins, right?

RUSSO: Yeah. It's a shame. But I'm not that close with my family, so, uh (sighs) is this gonna take long?

DEAN: No. Five minutes. Five minutes. Uh, can you – can you tell me anything, uh, noteworthy about the Russos?

RUSSO: Noteworthy? No. I mean, not exactly – average, you know, big, from Italy.

DEAN: I see. Uh, was anyone ever killed or maimed in a war or, you know, some other violent thing?

RUSSO: (scoffs) What do you mean?

DEAN: Like something so dark that it would sully future generations.

RUSSO: Uh... No.

DEAN: Good. Good stuff. Anyone own a slave?

RUSSO: What?

DEAN: Routine question. Any ties to the Nazi Party?

RUSSO: Excuse me?

DEAN: Did grandma ever piss off a gypsy?

RUSSO: Okay, you know what? (Russo stands up.) I don't know what kind of study you're doing, but it's over. Right now. So if you don't mind -

DEAN: Okay, I-I'll just cut to the chase here. (Dean stands.) Um, your life is in danger.

RUSSO: What? What is that, a threat? Are you threatening me?!

DEAN: No, no, no. No, no. I'm not threatening you. I'm just simply saying that if you don't watch your back, you're gonna die.

RUSSO: Get the hell out of my office.

DEAN: Okay.

RUSSO: Now!

(Dean turns around and leaves)


EXT. STREET

SAM: (on the phone) Hey.

DEAN: (on the phone) Sam.

SAM: Find anything?

DEAN: Uh, one asshat in a shiny suit. You?

SAM: Not much. Great grandparents born in Calabria. Emigrated 1912. Been here ever since.

DEAN: What, no severed horse head?

SAM: Ha. Four generations of picket fence.

DEAN: If these people are the Waltons, then why the hell are they dying?

(Dean gets in his car.)


INT. OFFICE

(In a travel agent's office, a copy machine is copying something.)

WOMAN: (on the phone) Well, how about Cuba? It's beautiful this time of year. And the new Trump Casino – amazing. Don't worry about the kids. There's a wave pool. Oh! Sure, yeah! (She writes something and drinks from a cup.)

(Time stops and Atropos walks in. She takes a set of keys fom the woman's handbag and drops them under the copy machine.)

WOMAN: Look, if you like cigars, Cher, or the circus, it's all about Havana. Yes, I've seen the Shatner ads. But you know what they don't have? Personal touch. Okay, then. I'll e-mail you some details. You too.

(She hangs up and looks for her keys in her handbag. Not finding them, she pats down her pockets, turns around, and notices her keys on the floor between the copy machine and a shelf. Confused, she picks them up and accidentally knocks over a vase of flowers, spilling water on the copy machine and short-circuiting it. Panicked, she presses buttons to try and stop it, then bends over it to try unplug it from the wall. While she's leaning over the copy machine, it activates and her silk scarf gets caught. The scarf is pulled into the copy machine and the woman, unable to free herself, is strangled.)

WOMAN: (gasps & chokes)

(Atropos walks into the room and opens her book. A gold thread falls to the ground. She crosses out a name in her book, closes it and walks away.)

ACT II
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

(Sam and Dean enter the office. They look around with flashlights. Dean picks up the deceased woman's business card.)

DEAN: Anne Witting. You sure she's not a Russo, a second cousin twice removed or something?

SAM: No, I checked the records twice. She's not related.

DEAN: Well, if this isn't a family curse, then what the hell is it?

SAM: You got me. I got nothing. (Sam looks through some papers.)

DEAN: (Dean spots a golden thread on the floor.) Hold on. (He picks it up.) Not nothing.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

(Sam is on his laptop.)

DEAN: (on the phone, he has the thread in his hand) So, we found another piece of this, I don't know, shiny string.

ELLEN: (on the phone, in Bobby's kitchen. She cuts up vegetables in front of the stove, then wipes her hands.) Oh, I was afraid of that.

DEAN: Why? What's up?

ELLEN: Oh, these so-called accidents – we're seeing 'em nationwide. About 75 so far. I got Jo and her crew working on a cluster in California. (Ellen sees Bobby opening a beer and takes it from him.)

BOBBY: Hey. Hey. Hey.

DEAN: Blood relatives?

ELLEN: Some yeah, some no. She's got about what you do – pile of bodies and a whole bunch of gold thread. (Bobby walks to the stove, smells the food, picks up a vegetable and eats it.)

DEAN: So what's it mean?

ELLEN: I don't know. I got Bobby working on it right now.

DEAN: How's he doing, by the way? (Dean gets up.)

ELLEN: Oh, don't worry. I'm kicking his ass back to health and happiness.

BOBBY: Who asked you to? To hell with you. (Bobby walks out the kitchen.)

DEAN: I heard that.

ELLEN: He'll be okay.

DEAN: Are you okay?

ELLEN: Aw, honey, you're sweet. You know me. I just worry about you boys.

DEAN: (Dean sits back down.) Yeah, well. All right, so, all these corpses, anything relate 'em?

ELLEN: Well, actually, I did dig up one thing. I just don't know what to make of it. (She puts the beer down and walks to the stove.)

DEAN: Hit me.

ELLEN: (She scoops a spoonful of food out the pot, smells it and adds some salt.) Well, it's a weird one, and it was buried pretty deep, but Bobby and me were combing through the family trees on all the victims, and we started seeing, well, the families all came over to America the same year.

DEAN: Hmm.

ELLEN: Yeah. 1912. But here's the real weird part. They all came over on the same boat.

DEAN: Really?

ELLEN: Yep.

DEAN: All right, so what's so special about the boat?

ELLEN: Nothing. It was a boat. It did what boats do.

DEAN: What was it called?

ELLEN: The Titanic. Did you ever hear of it? (She takes a sip of beer.)

DEAN: No.

ELLEN: Yeah, me neither. I'll keep digging.

DEAN: All right. (Dean hangs up)

(Ellen pours some beer in the pot.)

DEAN: Does the name Titanic ring a bell?

SAM: Titanic? No.

(Sam researches)

SAM: (sighs and quotes a website) The RMS Titanic was the largest passenger steamship in the world when it made its maiden voyage across the North Atlantic in 1912.

DEAN: So what's the big friggin' deal? It's a ship. It sailed.

SAM: Yeah, I don't know. Um... Oh, looks like there was a close call. Ship almost hit an iceberg.

DEAN: Almost? So?

SAM: So, uh, looks like the first mate spotted it just in time.

DEAN: Good for him. There anything else?

SAM: Wait a second.

DEAN: What?

SAM: Uh, this first mate. Mr I.P. Freeley.

DEAN: Well, that's not suspicious. You got a picture of old Freeley?

SAM: Oh, you got to be kidding me. (The photograph is of Balthazar.)

DEAN: (Dean gets up to look at the photo.) Let's see. Balthazar.

(Sam and Dean summon Balthazar – they carry a table to the middle of the room. Dean puts a bowl and candles on it and draws something in chalk. Sam closes the curtains. Dean lights a match and drops it into the bowl. The lights flicker. Sam and Dean look around. Balthazar appears.)

BALTHAZAR: Boys, boys, boys. Whatever can I do for you?

DEAN: We need to talk.

BALTHAZAR: Oh, you seem upset, Dean.

DEAN: The hell with the boat, Balthazar?

BALTHAZAR: What boat?

SAM: The Titanic.

BALTHAZAR: Oh. Ja. The Titanic. Yes, well, uh, it was meant to sink, and I saved it.

SAM: What?

BALTHAZAR: Well it was meant to bash into this iceberg thing and plunge into the briny deep with all this hoopla, and I saved it. Anything else I can answer for you?

SAM: Why?

BALTHAZAR: Why what?

DEAN: Why did you un-sink the ship?

BALTHAZAR: Oh, because I hated the movie.

DEAN: What movie?

BALTHAZAR: Exactly. (laughs)

SAM: Wait, so you saved a cruise liner because—

BALTHAZAR: Because that God-awful Celine Dion song made me want to smite myself.

SAM: Who's Celine Dion?

BALTHAZAR: Oh, she's a destitute lounge singer somewhere in Quebec, and let's keep it that way, please.

SAM: Okay, I didn't think that was possible. I thought you couldn't change history.

BALTHAZAR: Oh, haven't you noticed? There's no more rules, boys.

SAM: (scoffs) Wow. The nerve on you. So you just, what, un-sunk a giant boat?

BALTHAZAR: Oh come on. I saved people. I thought you loved that kind of thing.

SAM: Yeah, but now those people and their kids and their kids' kids, they must have interacted with – with so many other people, changed so much crap. You totally Butterfly-Effected history!

DEAN: Dude. Dude. Rule one, no Kutcher references.

BALTHAZAR: Ah, yes. Unfortunately, there's still an Ashton Kutcher. And you still averted the Apocalypse, and there are still Archangels. It's just the small details that are different, like you don't drive an Impala. (Sam & Dean look confused.) Yes, yes. "What's an Impala?" Trust me, it's not important. And, of course, Ellen and Jo are alive. (Balthazar walks over to the counter, picks up a bottle and pours himself a drink.)

DEAN: Ellen and Jo? What?

BALTHAZAR: Yes, they're supposed to be dead. You see, I save a boat, one thing leads to another, which leads to another thousand things, and yada, yada, yada. To cut a long story short, they don't die in a massive explosion. (He drinks.) Mmm. Anyway, let's agree I did a good thing. One less Billy Zane movie and I saved two of your closest friends.

SAM: But now somebody is killing the descendants of the survivors.

BALTHAZAR: And?

SAM: And that's maybe like 50,000 people.

BALTHAZAR: And?

DEAN: And we need to save as many as we can, but we need to know who's after 'em.

BALTHAZAR: Oh, uh, sorry, uh. You have me confused with the other angel – you know, the one in the dirty trenchcoat who's in love with you. I... don't care. (He takes another sip.) Goodbye, boys.

(Balthazar vanishes.)

DEAN: Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait. Son of a bitch!


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE & INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

BOBBY: (on the phone) So, Balthazar un-sank a boat, and now we got a boatload of people who should never have been born.

SAM: (on speakerphone) Yeah. Like 50,000.

BOBBY: Makes sense.

SAM: How does any of this make sense?

BOBBY: Because I got an idea who we're up against.

DEAN: What?

BOBBY: Fate.

DEAN: You mean—?

BOBBY: I mean Fate, like the Fates. Or one of 'em, at least. (The book Bobby has in front of him shows three women sitting, holding a long gold thread.)

SAM: You mean like Greek mythology? Like the sisters?

BOBBY: Bingo.

DEAN: Nerd.

BOBBY: These ladies are responsible for how you go down, literally. So if you get creamed by a garage door or crunched by a copy machine, they're the ones who hammer out the details of how you die. Spin out your fate on a piece of pure gold.

SAM: Gold thread.

BOBBY: (Takes a sip of coffee.) And then one of 'em writes it all down in her Day Runner of Death. It's high-level stuff. Anyway – fits. Now we know what Balthazar did. It seems to me that maybe Fate is just trying to clean up the mess.

SAM: So, how do we stop it?

BOBBY: How do we stop Fate? Good question.

DEAN: Well, there's got to be a way.

BOBBY: Or there ain't. I mean, this is Fate we're talking about here. You know, the easiest way would be to get that angel to re-sink the boat.

DEAN: No. No way. Forget it.

BOBBY: Big difference between dying awful and never being born, Dean.

DEAN: We are not sinking the boat, Bobby. Okay? Don't even think about it.

BOBBY: Well, okay. What's got your panties in a clench?

DEAN: Nothing.

BOBBY: Try that again?

DEAN: It – Look, it – it – it doesn't even really matter, but...

BOBBY: But?

DEAN: Apparently, a crapload of dominoes get tipped over if the Titanic goes down. And, uh, bottom line – Ellen and Jo die.

BOBBY: (Looks at the picture of himself and Ellen by the B & E Scrap Yard sign.) Okay, you two. Listen up. You make sure... Keep those angels from sinking that boat. Do you understand me?

SAM: Yeah.

DEAN: Yes.

SAM: Yeah, Bobby, of course.

(Bobby hangs up)

DEAN: Oh, he's bad enough with her. Think how he'd be if she was gone.

SAM: Yeah. (sighs) So, what do we do? I mean, how do we save 50,000 people?

DEAN: I got no freaking clue.

SAM: Yeah. We don't even know who they are.

DEAN: Well, we know one. (Dean points at Shawn Russo's pamphlet.)


EXT. STREET - DAY

(From inside the Mustang Dean spots Russo. Russo is walking with a client who is in a neck brace. Russo leaves the client and walks off on his own.)

DEAN: That's him. Let's go.

(Sam and Dean exit the Mustang and follow Russo. Russo's phone rings.)

RUSSO: (on the phone) Hello. Yeah. What?

DEAN: Mr. Russo!

RUSSO: (on the phone) I don't care. Send him a fruitcake.

(A man in a car is driving along. he takes a sip of coffee.)

DEAN: Shawn!

RUSSO: (on the phone) Who's the judge?

DEAN: Russo!

RUSSO: (on the phone) All right, send him a nice bottle of champagne. But nothing more than 30—

DEAN: Shawn!

RUSSO: (on the phone) Ah, no. 20 bucks. Believe me, this guy – he owes me.

(The guy in the car spills his coffee all over himself.)

DEAN Russo, stop!

(Russo stops and turns to face Dean.)

(The guy brakes and narrowly misses running over Russo. Russo falls and drops his phone. Sam helps him up. Dean holds out Russo's phone.)

(There are worried murmurs from passers-by.)

RUSSO: Get off of me. (to Dean) And you – I told you to leave me alone, didn't I?

DEAN: Look, we're just trying to help you out, okay?

RUSSO: Help me?! You almost killed me, you lunatic. Give me that. (He grabs his cell phone away from Dean.) Unbelievable. (Russo walks away, crossing a street.)

DEAN: Russo! Hey!

RUSSO: (from the middle of the street) Just be glad I'm not suing your a—! (Russo is hit by a bus.)

ACT III
EXT. STREET - DAY

DEAN You've got to be kidding me. (Dean looks at Russo's remains and the huge blood stain on the street then up at the bus. On the back of the bus is an ad for Russo's law service) Sam, check it out.

SAM What? 

DEAN (Pointing at the ad) Too soon?

SAM Yeah, Dean. I'm pretty sure six seconds is too soon. (Sam spots Atropos staring at them from inside a nearby building) Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I think I saw her. Right over there.

DEAN Her? Like fate her?

SAM Yeah.

DEAN What'd she look like?

SAM Kind of like a librarian. 

DEAN Your kind of librarian or my kind of librarian?

SAM Well, she was wearing clothes, if that's what you mean.

DEAN All right.

SAM Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. We can't just walk over there.

DEAN We're not on the hit list. We have nothing to do with the boat. Let's go talk to her.

SAM Talk.

DEAN Yeah, you know. (Dean briefly pulls out his gun) Talk. Worth a shot, right?

INT. ABANDONED RESTAURANT

DEAN Hello? Hello?

(Atropos stops time and turns the gas dials open on several stoves)

DEAN Hello? (Dean's flashlight dies) Oh, come on. 

SAM You got a lighter?

DEAN Yeah. Okay. (the lighter doesn't work)

SAM Oh, come on. It's out of juice or something?

DEAN It shouldn't be.

(The lighter finally sparks and the gas catches fire. Castiel yanks Sam & Dean out if the warehouse just before the ignited gas reaches them)

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 

DEAN Cas!

CASTIEL Hello, Dean. Sam.

SAM Hey, thanks man. Where are we?

CASTIEL White Russia.

SAM What?!

DEAN Are you aware of what your frat bro did?

CASTIEL I'm aware. Balthazar can be impetuous.

DEAN Well, riddle me this – if fate's going after the boat people, why'd she try to waste me and Sam?

CASTIEL Well, I imagine she harbors a certain degree of rage toward you.

SAM What did we do?

CASTIEL Nothing of import – just the tiny matter of averting the Apocalypse and rendering her obsolete. I think maybe she's a little irritated about that. And then you go and dangle yourselves in front of her...

DEAN So we've pissed fate off personally.

CASTIEL If I know her – and I do – she won't stop until you're dead.

DEAN  Awesome. So what do we do?

CASTIEL Kill her.

SAM Kill fate?

CASTIEL Do you have another suggestion?

SAM No, I'm – I just mean, uh...Can you even do that?

CASTIEL Balthazar has a weapon that will work against her.

DEAN Of course he does. Yeah. Boy, that guy's just got it covered, doesn't he? You need new friends, Cas.

CASTIEL I'm trying to save the ones I have, Dean. We'll have to draw her out.

SAM All right, well, uh, she's gunning for us. She's bound to surface again eventually.

CASTIEL We'll make it easy for her. I think you have an expression for it. "Tempting fate."

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

ELLEN (on the phone) Yeah, well, you just be careful. (to Bobby) That was Jo. 30 more dead on the West Coast. What exactly do those boys think they're gonna do?

BOBBY It's the boys. If anybody can pull this out of their ass, it's those two.

ELLEN Yeah, you ever hear the saying "you can't stop fate"? You know, cleanest fix would just be to sink the boat.

BOBBY Why would you say that?

ELLEN Well, because, right now they're all dying bloody. It's not the same as never being born.

BOBBY You're talking about people – people who are loved...Who would be missed.

ELLEN What the hell is up with you?

BOBBY Nothing.

ELLEN Oh, please. You are a neon sign. So, I can beat it out of you, or we could just skip that part – dealer's choice.

(time passes, Ellen and Bobby are now sitting at the kitchen table)

ELLEN So, not just me, but Jo, too?

BOBBY They're not gonna sink the boat. I promise. The boat stays. You don't have to worry.

ELLEN Well...If it was meant to be, then...I guess whatever happens, happens.

BOBBY But that's just my point. Nothing's "meant to be." Whether we're together is at the whim of some dick angel.

ELLEN Oh, Bobby, relax.

BOBBY I can't. We need you. Especially me.

ELLEN I know.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

DEAN Okay, so, we're just gonna meet our fate at any time, right?

SAM Yeah. Just walk. Act natural.

(The song 'one way or another' plays in the background. Sam and Dean pass a set of stairs and a skateboarder sails right past them )

DEAN Okay.

SAM That's fine.

(A bicyclist passes them, then a man with two large barking dogs)

DEAN Oh you gotta be kidding me.

(the brothers have stopped walking in front of a group of street performers who are juggling swords and hatchets)

SAM All right, just – just keep walking.

DEAN Sam, they're juggling knives. And hatchets.

SAM Yeah, I know. (the jugglers switch to torches) Can't avoid fate.

(Sam and Dean walk right between the jugglers, but remain unharmed.  They come across a man with a jammed nail gun.  He points it at Dean while trying to unjam it. ) 

DEAN Ah. (again, nothing happens) 

SAM All right. I don't get it.

DEAN I don't either. Who do you got to kill to get killed around here?

SAM Maybe Cas was wrong.

MAN Look out! 

(A huge air conditioner falls out of the building Sam and Dean are passing and looks like it will crush them. Time stops.)

FINAL ACT
EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

(Sam and Dean are still directly under the falling air conditioner, time is still frozen. Castiel approaches them.)

ATROPOS Castiel.

CASTIEL Atropos. You look well.

ATROPOS I look like stomped-over crap, because of you.

CASTIEL All right, let's talk about this.

ATROPOS Talk? About what? Maybe about how you and those two circus clowns destroyed my work. You ruined my life.

CASTIEL Let's not get emotional.

ATROPOS Not get emotional?! I had a job. God gave me a job. We all had a script. I worked hard. I was really, really good at what I did...Until the day of the big prize fight. And then what happens? You throw out the book!

CASTIEL Well, I'm sorry. But freedom is more preferable.

ATROPOS Freedom? This is chaos! How is it better? You know, I even went to Heaven just to ask what to do next, and you know what? No one would even talk to me.

CASTIEL There are more pressing matters at hand.

ATROPOS But I don't know what happens next. I need to know. It's what I do.

CASTIEL I'm sorry. But your services are no longer required.

ATROPOS You know what? I've kept my mouth shut. I could have complained, I could have raised a fuss, but I didn't. But you know what the last straw is? Un-sinking the Titanic. You changed the future. You cannot change the past. That is going too far!

CASTIEL It's Balthazar. He's erratic—

ATROPOS Bull crap. This isn't about some stupid movie. He's under your orders. You sent him back to save that ship.

CASTIEL No, I didn't. Why would I?

ATROPOS Oh, maybe because you're in the middle of a war and you're desperate?

ATROPOS Come on. This is about the souls.

CASTIEL You don't know what you're talking about.

ATROPOS That angel went and created 50,000 new souls for your war machine.

CASTIEL You're confused.

ATROPOS No. You can't just mint money, Castiel. It's wrong...It's dangerous... And I won't let you.

CASTIEL You don't have a choice.

ATROPOS Maybe I don't. So here's a choice for you. If you don't go back and sink that boat, I'm gonna kill your two favorite pets.

CASTIEL I won't let you.

ATROPOS Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

CASTIEL Do you really want to test me?

ATROPOS Okay. Fine. But think about this – I've got two sisters out there. They're bigger, in every sense of the word. Kill me – Sam and Dean are target one. For simple vengeance. You're not fighting a war or anything, right? You can watch them every millisecond of every day. Because maybe you've heard – fate strikes when you least expect it.

CASTIEL Balthazar, stop.

(Balthazar stands behind Atropos, his blade raised to stab her)

BALTHAZAR Ah. Awkward.

ATROPOS Set things right before I flick your precious boys off a cliff just on principle.

BALTHAZAR Uh, sweetie, before we go, um, I could remove that stick from your—

ATROPOS Don't try me.

BALTHAZAR Oh. We'll leave it inserted, then. All right, then. Let's sink the Titanic.

(time unfreezes, Atropos, Castiel, Balthazar, Sam & Dean disappear and the air conditioner crashes to the ground)

EXT. BOBBY'S SCRAPYARD

(The boys wake up in the Impala. 'My Heart Will Go On' plays on the radio)

SAM Dude, what time is it? I-I just had the weirdest dream

DEAN 20 bucks says mine was weirder. I am not kidding.

SAM No, no, no. I'm not kidding either. I-I mean, it was...Just bizarre.

DEAN Mine had the actual Titanic in it. What? Something on my face?

SAM D-did it, uh...Not sink, because Balthazar—

DEAN —had a hate on for Billy Zane? Why are you having my dreams, dude?

CASTIEL Wasn't a dream.

DEAN Wait, what? You're saying this actually happened? That t-the whole...Whatever – t-that was real?

CASTIEL Yes.

SAM Wait. So, what happened?

CASTIEL Well, I insisted he go back in time and correct what he'd done.

SAM What? Why?

CASTIEL It was the only way to be sure you were safe.

SAM So...So, you killed...50,000 people for us.

CASTIEL No, I didn't. They were never born. That's far different from being killed, wouldn't you say?

DEAN Ellen and Jo?

CASTIEL I'm sorry.

DEAN Hold on. Uh...So, if you guys went a-and changed everything back, then that whole timeline or whatever, it just got erased?

CASTIEL Yeah. More or less.

DEAN Well, then, how come he and I remember it?

CASTIEL Because I wanted you to remember it. 

SAM Why?

CASTIEL I wanted you to know who Fate really is. She's cruel and capricious.

DEAN I'd go so far as "bitch."

CASTIEL Well, yeah. You're the ones who taught me that you can make your own destiny. You don't have to be ruled by fate. You can choose freedom. I still believe that that's something worth fighting for. I just wanted you to understand that.

DEAN So, wait. Did...Balthazar really, uh, unravel the sweater over a chick flick?

CASTIEL Yes. Absolutely. That's what he did.

DEAN Wow. Well, might be time to take away his cable privileges. Besides, "Titanic" didn't suck that bad. (Sam gives Dean a look) Winslet's rack.

(Castiel disappears)

DEAN I'll tell you one thing about Cas, he does not appreciate the finer things.

(The boys head inside. Bobby is sleeping on the couch)

SAM I guess things are back to normal, huh?

DEAN "Normal." Awesome.

SAM Poor bastard. Doesn't even know how good he had it.

DEAN Yeah, well, what he doesn't know won't hurt him. I say we keep our mouths shut.

SAM Yeah. I'm with you. Should we wake him?

DEAN Nah. That's probably the best he's felt all week.

(Dean covers Bobby with a blanket)
