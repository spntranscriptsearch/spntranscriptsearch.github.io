NOW


EXT. PIER – DAY

DEAN is fishing at the end of a pier. CASTIEL appears.

CASTIEL
We need to talk.

DEAN
I'm dreaming, aren't I?

CASTIEL
It's not safe here. Someplace more private.

DEAN
More private? We're inside my head.

CASTIEL
Exactly. Someone could be listening.

DEAN
Cas, what's wrong?

CASTIEL
Meet me here.

CAS hands DEAN a piece of paper.

CASTIEL (CONT'D)
Go now.

DEAN looks up and CASTIEL is gone from the pier.



INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN wakes up with a gasp.



INT. WAREHOUSE – SAME NIGHT

DEAN and SAM walk through the warehouse, flashlights on.

SAM
Well, what did he say, Dean? What was so important?

DEAN
If I knew, would I be here?

DEAN and SAM ascend a set of stairs.

DEAN (CONT'D)
What the hell?

SAM
It looks like a bomb went off.

DEAN
There was a fight here.

SAM
Between who?

DEAN's flashlight beam lands on a symbol painted in blood on the wall.

DEAN
Check it out. Look familiar?

SAM
Yeah, it does.

DEAN
Anna used something like that to wish the angels back to the cornfield.

SAM
So, what? Cas was fighting angels?

DEAN
I don't know.

DEAN finds CASTIEL in the rubble.

DEAN (CONT'D)
Sam. Cas? Cas. Hey, Cas?

JIMMY
What's . . . ? What's . . . ? What's going on?

DEAN
Just take it easy. Take it easy.

JIMMY
Oh. No.

SAM
Cas, you okay?

JIMMY
Ugh. Castiel. I'm not Castiel. It's me.

SAM
Who's 'me'?

JIMMY
Jimmy. My name's Jimmy.

DEAN
Where the hell is Castiel?

JIMMY
He's gone.



Act One
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

JIMMY sits at a table and devours a hamburger while DEAN and SAM watch.

JIMMY
Mmm.

DEAN
You mind slowing down? You're gonna give me angina.

JIMMY
I'm hungry.

SAM
When's the last time you ate?

JIMMY
I don't know. Months.

JIMMY takes another bite of his hamburger and then continues to eat ravenously.

JIMMY
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!

SAM
What the hell happened back there? It looked like an angel battle royale.

JIMMY
All I remember is a flash of light and I, uh . . . I woke up and I was just, you know, like, me again.

DEAN
So, what? Cas just ditched out of your meat suit?

JIMMY
I really don't know.

SAM
You remember anything about being possessed? Anything at all?

JIMMY
Yeah, bits and pieces. I mean, angel inside of you, it's kinda like being chained to a comet.

DEAN
Ah, that doesn't sound like much fun.

JIMMY
Understatement.

SAM
Cas said he wanted to tell us something. Please tell me you remember that.

JIMMY
Sorry.

DEAN
Come on, what do you know?

JIMMY
My name is Jimmy Novak. I'm from Pontiac, Illinois.



FLASHBACK – PONTIAC, ILLINOIS – ONE YEAR AGO

INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM – NIGHT

JIMMY (VOICEOVER)
I have a family.

JIMMY, AMELIA (his wife), and CLAIRE (his daughter) are sitting down to dinner. CLAIRE reaches for some food.

JIMMY
Claire.

JIMMY, AMELIA, and CLAIRE join hands and bow their heads to say Grace.

JIMMY
Bless this food, oh, Lord, and ourselves to thy loving service that we may always continue in thy faith and fear to the honor and glory of thy name. Amen.

AMELIA and CLAIRE (TOGETHER)
Amen.



INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE, DEN – SAME NIGHT

JIMMY is asleep in his armchair with the TV on a religious channel.

RELIGIOUS MAN ON TV
I could see my head sticking out from underneath the front bumper. My eyes were closed, my head was turned to the right side, and on each side of me is an angel, and, uh –

The TV goes to static, waking JIMMY up. He stands.

JIMMY
What the heck?

JIMMY tries to turn off the TV, but is unsuccessful. The sound of the static becomes high pitched and JIMMY falls to his knees and covers his ears. Eventually, he falls to the ground and suffers convulsions.



PRESENT DAY

EXT. MOTEL – SAME NIGHT

SAM and DEAN stand outside.

SAM
So, what do we do?

DEAN
What do you mean? The guy's got a family. We buy him a bus ticket, send him home.

SAM
I don't know about that. Dean, he's the only lead we got.

DEAN
He doesn't know anything.

SAM
Are you 100 percent about that?

DEAN
You think he's lying? What, you wanna go Guantanamo on the guy?

SAM
Dean, maybe he doesn't even know what he knows.

DEAN
Huh?

SAM
I say, at least we get him to Bobby's. Maybe all he needs is hypnosis or a psychic. Or hell, maybe Cas will just drop back into him.

DEAN
I don't know, man.

SAM
Dean, back there, that was angel-on-angel violence. Now, I don't know what's going on, but it's big. And we can't just let the only lead we got just skip out.

DEAN shakes his head.

SAM
What?

DEAN
You remember when our job was helping people? Like, getting them back to their families?

SAM
You think I don't want to help him? I'm just being realistic. I mean, hell, we're doing him a favor.

DEAN
How?

SAM
Dean, if we want to question the guy, you can damn well bet the demons do, too.

DEAN sighs in defeat.



INT. MOTEL ROOM – SAME NIGHT

JIMMY
The hell are you talking about, I can't go home?

DEAN
There's a good chance you have a bull's-eye on your back.

JIMMY
What? From who?

DEAN
Demons.

JIMMY
Come on, that's crazy. What do they want with me?

DEAN
I don't know, information, maybe?

JIMMY
I don't know anything.

DEAN
I know, but –

JIMMY
Look, I'm done, okay? With demons, angels, all of it. I just want to go home.

DEAN
We understand.

JIMMY
I don't think that you do understand. I've been shot and stabbed and healed, and my body has been dragged all over the Earth. By some miracle, I'm out, and I am done. I've given enough, okay?

SAM
Look, all we're saying is that until we figure this out, the safest place is with us.

JIMMY
How long?

SAM
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

JIMMY shakes his head and tries to move past SAM to get to the door.

DEAN
Where are you going?

JIMMY
To see my wife and daughter, okay?

SAM
No, you're not. You're just going to put those people in danger.

JIMMY
So, what, now I'm a prisoner?

SAM
Harsh way to put it.



INT. MOTEL ROOM – LATER THE SAME NIGHT

SAM looks at JIMMY and DEAN, both of whom appear to be asleep. SAM leaves the room, and JIMMY gets up. JIMMY sneaks past DEAN and leaves the motel room.



EXT. MOTEL ROOM – SAME NIGHT

JIMMY leaves the room unnoticed by SAM, who stands by a vending machine. SAM opens a flask of blood, pours the blood out onto his hand, and licks it up greedily.



Act Two
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NEXT MORNING

SAM quickly packs a duffel bag while DEAN brushes his teeth.

SAM
Dean. Would you hurry up?

DEAN laughs, toothbrush still in his mouth.

SAM (CONT'D)
Sorry, uh, this is funny to you?

DEAN
Mr. Big-Bad-Prison-Guard, Jimmy McMook give you the slip? Yeah, it's pretty funny. What were you doing, anyway?

SAM
I was getting a Coke.

DEAN
Was it a refreshing Coke?

SAM
Can we just go, please?



INT. BUS – SAME DAY

JIMMY looks out the window of a bus.



FLASHBACK – ONE YEAR AGO

INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN – NIGHT

JIMMY is preparing dinner when the radio goes to static. He approaches the radio and listens to the static. The scene shifts and we see JIMMY with his hand in a pot of boiling water. His expression is calm. AMELIA comes home holding paper bags and drops them when she sees what he is doing.

AMELIA
What the hell are you doing?

JIMMY
It's okay. I'm okay.

AMELIA
Jimmy.

JIMMY
Look.

AMELIA
What's wrong with you?

JIMMY
Nothing's wrong. He asked me to do it.

AMELIA
Who asked you to do it?

JIMMY
Castiel, to prove my faith. Look. I'm fine. It's a miracle.

AMELIA
Who's Castiel?



PRESENT DAY

INT. BUS – SAME DAY

JIMMY is still looking out the window of a bus.



INT. IMPALA – SAME DAY

DEAN is driving while SAM sits beside him. Neither speaks. ANNA suddenly appears in the backseat.

ANNA
Hey, guys.

DEAN
Aah! Jeez.

DEAN jerks the steering wheel and the IMPALA swerves before he gets it back under control.

ANNA
Smooth.

DEAN
You ever try calling ahead?

ANNA
I like the element of surprise.

DEAN
Well, you look terrific.

ANNA
Um, yeah, not the most appropriate time, Dean. You let Jimmy get away?

DEAN
Talk to ginormo here.

ANNA
Sam. You seem different.

SAM
Me? I don't know. Heh. A haircut?

ANNA
That's not what I'm talking about.

ANNA gives SAM a meaningful look and he looks away. Then she looks at DEAN.

ANNA (CONT'D)
So, what'd Jimmy tell you? He remember anything?

DEAN
Why? What's going on?

ANNA
It's Cas. He got sent back home. Well, more like dragged back.

DEAN
To heaven? That's not a good thing?

ANNA
No. That's a very bad thing. Painfully, awfully bad. He must have seriously pissed someone off.

DEAN
Cas said he had something to tell me. Something important.

ANNA
What?

DEAN
I don't know.

ANNA
Does Jimmy know?

DEAN
I don't think so.

ANNA
You don't think so? Whatever it is, it's huge. You gotta find out for sure.

SAM
That's why we're going after Jimmy.

ANNA
That's why you shouldn't have let him go in the first place. He's probably dead already.



EXT. JIMMY'S HOUSE – DAY

JIMMY approaches his house. He sees his daughter, CLAIRE, through the window working on homework. She calls over her shoulder, and AMELIA comes forward to help her.



FLASHBACK – ONE YEAR AGO

INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE, DEN – NIGHT

JIMMY sits on a couch and speaks with his wife, AMELIA.

AMELIA
Take the pills.

JIMMY
I'm not sick.

AMELIA
Jimmy, take the pills.

JIMMY
I know that this is hard to understand, but he chose me.

AMELIA
Castiel, the angel?

JIMMY
He's spoken to me now, Ames, a dozen times. Hey, you believe in God, don't you?

AMELIA
What kind of question is that? Of course.

JIMMY
And angels?

AMELIA
Yes, Jimmy.

JIMMY
So, why is it then so hard for you to believe that they're talking to me?

AMELIA
Jimmy, you sell ad time for A.M. radio.

JIMMY
No, he said that I'm special. It's in my blood.

AMELIA
What does that mean, it's in your blood, hm?

JIMMY
He didn't say. He just said that God has chosen me for a higher purpose.

AMELIA
To do what?

JIMMY
No, it's God's will. Not really my place to question it. Hey, come here. This is a blessing. This is the most important thing that ever happened to me.

AMELIA
I thought we were the most important things to ever happen to you.

JIMMY
Hey, have faith.

AMELIA
Jimmy, you're scaring me.

JIMMY
God will provide.

AMELIA
If you won't take your pills and if you won't get help, then I'm going to take Claire to my mother's in the morning.

AMELIA leaves the room and goes upstairs. JIMMY gets dressed in the clothes that CASTIEL wears and leaves the house. He stands outside and addresses the sky.

JIMMY
So, I wanna to help you. I'm about to lose my family here if you don't tell me how . . . Please, Castiel, just talk to me. What do you want from me?

A soft light appears and illuminates JIMMY from above. Faint whispers can be heard. JIMMY looks up and appears to be listening.

JIMMY
Yes, I understand. Promise my family will be okay and I'll do it . . . Then, yes.

A bright beam of light shines down on JIMMY. He looks up into the light. When the light disappears, he is CASTIEL. CASTIEL lifts a hand and looks at it. The front door of JIMMY's house opens behind him and CLAIRE walks outside.

CLAIRE
Daddy?

CASTIEL turns and looks at CLAIRE. He appears briefly confused. Then he turns his back to her again.

CASTIEL
I am not your father.

CASTIEL walks away. CLAIRE watches him leave.



PRESENT DAY

EXT. JIMMY'S HOUSE – SAME DAY

JIMMY rings the doorbell. AMELIA answers the door.

AMELIA
We, uh – we stopped looking for you.

JIMMY
I'm so sorry.

AMELIA
You were dead. We, uh – we thought you were dead.

JIMMY
I'm okay.



INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE – SAME DAY

JIMMY and AMELIA sit in the den. CLAIRE comes down the stairs and approaches them.

AMELIA
Claire. Room. Now.

JIMMY
Can I see her?

AMELIA
No. No. I don't know yet. It's been almost a year, you know?

JIMMY
I know, I know.

AMELIA
Yeah. Think your daughter would have wanted to know you were okay?

JIMMY
I was in a psych clinic. I just wanted to get myself straight before seeing you.

AMELIA
Oh. And no telephones, or – ?

JIMMY
No, I know. You're right. I'm – I'm so sorry. But it's all – it's all over now. I mean, I'm – I'm really okay.

AMELIA
What does that mean?

JIMMY
I was – I was confused, Amelia. I was completely delusional. And I thought – I thought God was calling me to something and I thought that it was important, and I was wrong. I was such an idiot. Heaven, hell . . . none of that matters. The only thing that's important to me is you and Claire. And I – I can't undo what I've done. But I just wanna come home again.

AMELIA
I don't know if I can do that. Not yet.

JIMMY
I mean, whatever you're comfortable with. Maybe we could start with something smaller?

AMELIA
Like what?

JIMMY
I don't know. Dinner?



INT. GAS STATION – NIGHT

SAM talks on his cell phone while DEAN stands outside, gassing up the IMPALA.

SAM
Where the hell are you, Ruby? This isn't funny anymore. I'm all out. Stop whatever you're doing. Call me. I need more.



INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM – SAME NIGHT

CLAIRE approaches JIMMY.

CLAIRE
Hi, Daddy.

JIMMY
Hi, baby.

CLAIRE and JIMMY embrace. AMELIA enters the room with a platter of sandwiches.

AMELIA
Okay, so we have turkey and roast beef. Better be okay. It's all we have.

JIMMY
Oh, it's fine. It's more than fine. Should we sit?

AMELIA
Yeah.

JIMMY, AMELIA, and CLAIRE sit at the dining room table. JIMMY reaches for a sandwich.

JIMMY
It's perfect.

CLAIRE
Daddy, aren't you going to say Grace?

JIMMY
No, honey, I don't think I am.

CLAIRE
Why are you crying?

JIMMY
Because I'm happy.

The doorbell rings and AMELIA gets up to answer the door.

AMELIA (O.S.)
Hey, Roger.

ROGER (O.S.)
Hey, Ames. How you doing?

AMELIA (O.S.)
Good.

ROGER
Am I crazy or did I just see your husband wander in here about half an hour ago?

AMELIA
Yeah, uh, you did. But, Roger, now is not a good time.

JIMMY approaches and ROGER opens his arms. They embrace.

ROGER
Hey, there he is. Son of a bitch. What the hell happened to you?

JIMMY
Ah, long story. But it's over.

ROGER
Yeah?

JIMMY
I'm good.

ROGER
Can I talk to you?

AMELIA
Can I get you a beer?

ROGER
That'd be good. Thanks.

AMELIA leaves JIMMY and ROGER to speak in private.

ROGER
Buddy, you scared the hell out of a lot of people.

JIMMY
I know. I know.

ROGER
So really, what happened?

JIMMY
Honestly, worst year of my life and you wouldn't believe a word of it, but it's all okay now. I swear.

ROGER
Actually, no, it's not.

JIMMY
What do you mean?

ROGER
Well, I mean I'm gonna gut your daughter while you watch.

ROGER's eyes turn black. He is a demon. He smiles and his eyes shift back to normal just as AMELIA approaches and hands him a beer.

AMELIA
Here you go.

While ROGER is distracted, JIMMY hits him over the head with a candlestick and then continues to hit him after he has crumpled to the ground. AMELIA watches, in shock.

AMELIA
What are you doing? Jimmy, stop!

JIMMY
He's a demon! Run!

AMELIA
Stop it!

JIMMY
Run!



Act Three
INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE, UTILITY ROOM – SAME NIGHT

JIMMY pushes AMELIA and CLAIRE into a utility room and begins searching the shelves.

JIMMY
Where is it?

AMELIA
Roger was your best friend.

JIMMY
Roger was a demon, damn it.

JIMMY finds a bag of salt and pours it in a line across the doorway.

JIMMY (CONT'D)
Don't cross this line!

AMELIA
Jimmy, you thought you were better, but you are so sick.

JIMMY
Look, I am not crazy.

AMELIA
You stay the hell away from us!

JIMMY
This is all very, very real.

AMELIA
Stay the hell away from us!

JIMMY
Claire, sweetie –

AMELIA
No! Run. Leave her alone, I said.

While JIMMY and AMELIA struggle, CLAIRE runs out of the utility room. JIMMY breaks free and goes after her.

JIMMY
Stay here.

AMELIA
Stay away from her.

JIMMY
Claire!

JIMMY and AMELIA run out and into the dining room, where ROGER has CLAIRE. He has a knife against CLAIRE's neck.

JIMMY
Damn it.

ROGER
Hey, pal. Told you I'd gut the bitch.

AMELIA
Roger.

CLAIRE
Daddy?

JIMMY
Just let her go, okay?

ROGER
Now, me, I would, but the missus, she has other ideas.

AMELIA
No!

CLAIRE
Daddy!

MRS. ROGER grabs JIMMY and throws him to the ground. She punches him and then looks over her shoulder. AMELIA sees that her eyes are black.

AMELIA
Oh, my God. No!

AMELIA jumps on MRS. ROGER, but is thrown back. Suddenly, DEAN appears behind ROGER and cuts his throat with Ruby's knife, killing him. MRS. ROGER gets up, but is quickly caught by SAM, who stretches out his hand and uses his psychic abilities to begin exorcising her. DEAN looks back at SAM.

SAM
Go. Get them out of here.

DEAN
Go, go.

JIMMY and CLAIRE flee. SAM tries to exorcise MRS. ROGER, but is unsuccessful. MRS. ROGER smiles and approaches him.

MRS. ROGER
Aw. Can't get it up, can you, Sam?

DEAN
No, but I can.

Before DEAN can stab her with Ruby's knife, the demon flees its host body. DEAN grabs SAM and they run out to the IMPALA.

DEAN
Come on, come on, come on, come on.



EXT. JIMMY'S HOUSE – SAME NIGHT

SAM and DEAN run out to the IMPALA, where JIMMY and CLAIRE wait.

JIMMY
Thank god.

DEAN
Where's your wife?

AMELIA
Right here.

DEAN
Let's go.

They ALL get into the IMPALA and peel away.



EXT. PARKING GARAGE – SAME NIGHT

JIMMY, DEAN, and SAM stand outside the IMPALA. AMELIA and CLAIRE sit together in the back seat of the IMPALA.

JIMMY
You were right.

DEAN
I'm sorry we were.

JIMMY
I'm telling you, I don't know anything.

DEAN
I don't think they're inclined to believe you.

SAM
And even if they did, you're a vessel. They're still gonna wanna know what makes you tick.

DEAN
Which means vivisection, if they're feeling generous.

SAM
I'm gonna tell you once again, you're putting your family in danger. You have to come with us.

JIMMY
How long? And don't give me that "cross that bridge when we get to it" crap.

SAM
Don't you get it? Forever. The demons will never stop. You can never be with your family. So you either get as far away from them as possible or you put a bullet in your head. And that's how you keep your family safe. But there's no getting out and there's no going home.

DEAN
Well, don't sugarcoat it, Sam.

SAM
I'm just telling him the truth, Dean. Someone has to.

JIMMY opens the back door of the IMPALA to speak to AMELIA. CLAIRE is asleep next to her.

AMELIA
Hey. So I pretty much owe you the biggest apology ever.

JIMMY
No, you don't.

AMELIA
Yes, I do. I'm so sorry, Jimmy. And I will never, ever forgive myself for letting you walk out that door.

JIMMY
Well, you did what any rational person would have done. I mean, hell, I thought I was crazy half the time.

AMELIA
So demons, huh?

JIMMY
Yeah.

AMELIA
Can we . . . ? Can we even go home, or . . . ? What are we gonna do?

JIMMY
These boys are gonna get you a car, don't ask me how, and you're gonna take Claire to Carl and Sally's as fast as you can.

AMELIA
Wait. What about you? . . . No, I'm not going anywhere without you, Jimmy.

JIMMY
Listen to me. Every moment that I'm with you, you and Claire are in danger.

AMELIA
I don't care. We are not splitting up again.

JIMMY
We don't have a choice.

AMELIA
For how long?

JIMMY
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

AMELIA
We're a family.

JIMMY
They will kill you, Amelia, and they'll kill Claire. You just have to get as far away from me as you can.

JIMMY and AMELIA embrace while DEAN watches. The scene shifts and SAM is hotwiring a car while AMELIA waits. JIMMY and CLAIRE stand next to each other.

SAM
Okay, so, uh, here's your car.

JIMMY
Hey. Take care of your mom, okay, bub?

CLAIRE
Okay.

JIMMY gets in the back seat of the IMPALA and DEAN and SAM get in the front. They drive away while AMELIA and CLAIRE watch.

CLAIRE
Why is he leaving again?

AMELIA turns to CLAIRE and slaps her face. CLAIRE screams and AMELIA's eyes turn black. She is a demon.

AMELIA
Because it's just not my day, is it? You little bitch.



INT. IMPALA – SAME NIGHT

It's raining as DEAN drives. JIMMY is asleep in the back seat.

DEAN
What the hell happened back there?

SAM
What?

DEAN
You practically fainted trying to gank a demon.

SAM
Okay, I didn't faint. I got a little dizzy.

DEAN
Well, you can call it whatever you want. Point is, you used to be strong enough to kill Alastair. Now you can't even kill a stunt-demon number three?

SAM
What do you want me to say about it, Dean?

DEAN
Well for starters, what's going on with your mojo? I mean, it's yo-yoing all over the place. I'm not trying to pick a fight here, okay? I just – you're scaring me, man.

SAM
I'm scaring myself.

SAM's cellphone rings and he answers it.

SAM (CONT'D)
Hello? . . . Who is this?

SAM turns and holds the phone out to JIMMY.

SAM (CONT'D)
Hey. It's your wife.

JIMMY wakes up and takes the phone from SAM.

JIMMY
Amelia? . . . Oh, my God.



Act Four
EXT. WAREHOUSE – SAME NIGHT

JIMMY, DEAN, and SAM get out of the IMPALA.

DEAN
Alright, they're expecting you to come alone. That's exactly what you're gonna do.

SAM
We'll work our way through the catwalks. We'll be right behind you.

DEAN
All you gotta do is stay calm and stall. Let us do our job.

JIMMY
You want me to stay calm? This is my family we're talking about.

DEAN
Listen to me, this will work. You understand? Nobody's gonna get hurt.

JIMMY
Yeah, whatever. Give me a minute, okay?

JIMMY walks away from DEAN and SAM, towards the warehouse.

SAM
There's no way they're expecting him to come alone, Dean. You know this is probably a trap.

DEAN
Yeah, I know. That's why I have a plan.



EXT. WAREHOUSE – SAME NIGHT

JIMMY walks towards the warehouse, shouting at the sky.

JIMMY
Castiel, you son of a bitch! You promised me my family would be okay. You promised you were gonna take care of them. I gave you everything you asked me to give. I gave you more. This is the thanks I get? This is what you do? This is your heaven? Help me, please. You promised, Cas. Just help me.

Nobody answers and JIMMY shakes his head.

JIMMY (CONT'D)
Typical.

JIMMY enters the warehouse. AMELIA stands next to CLAIRE, who is tied to a chair and unconscious.

AMELIA
Hi, honey. You're home.

JIMMY
Listen, I'm – I'm begging you here. You do whatever you want with me, but my wife and daughter, they're just – they're not a part of this.

AMELIA
Oh, they're a big part of this, Jimmy. And P.S. You should've come alone.

JIMMY
I am alone.

AMELIA
Oh, you're such a liar. Like I didn't think you'd bring Heckle and Jeckle, hmm?

SAM and DEAN are led into the room by three DEMONs who hold them prisoner.

SAM
Nice plan, Dean.

DEAN
Yeah, well, nobody bats 1,000.

AMELIA
Got the knife?

One of the DEMONs holding SAM holds up Ruby's knife to show her.

AMELIA (CONT'D)
And you know what's funny?

DEAN
You wearing a soccer mom?

AMELIA
Is I was actually bummed to get this detail, picking up an empty vessel. Sort of like a milk run. Now look who landed in my lap.

SAM
Yeah, well, you got us, okay? Let these people go.

AMELIA
Oh, Sam. It's easy to act chivalrous when your Wonder Girl powers aren't working, huh? Now for the punch line. Everybody dies.

AMELIA holds up a gun and shoots JIMMY in the gut. He falls to his knees. AMELIA turns to one of the DEMONs holding SAM.

AMELIA (CONT'D)
Waste Little Orphan Annie.

AMELIA leaves the room while the DEMON walks around JIMMY and towards CLAIRE, who is still tied to a chair and unconscious. The DEMON picks up a pipe and swings it towards CLAIRE, but she suddenly grabs the pipe in one hand and places the other hand on the DEMON's forehead. The DEMON screams as he is exorcised in a bright light. Using the distraction, SAM and DEAN turn on the DEMONs holding them. While they struggle, CLAIRE, who is now possessed by CASTIEL, burns away the ropes holding her. JIMMY lies on the ground, bleeding, and looks at her in horror.

JIMMY
Castiel.

SAM and DEAN continue to fight the DEMONs. SAM gets Ruby's knife back from the female DEMON and holds her down, staring at her neck. DEAN is being pummeled by the male DEMON, when CASTIEL approaches and places her hand on his head, exorcising him. SAM cuts the neck of the female DEMON and drinks her blood. He turns, mouth still bloody, to see DEAN and CASTIEL (still in CLAIRE's body) watching him in horror. SAM turns back and stabs the demon through the heart with Ruby's knife, killing her, and then turns towards DEAN and CASTIEL again. He stands and holds out his hand, just in time to catch AMELIA and exorcise her with his recharged psychic powers. DEAN holds AMELIA up and CASTIEL goes over to JIMMY, who is dying from his gunshot wound.

CASTIEL
Of course we keep our promises. Of course you have our gratitude. You served us well. Your work is done. It's time to go home now. Your real home. You'll rest forever in the fields of the Lord. Rest now, Jimmy.

JIMMY
No. Claire?

CASTIEL
She's with me now. She's chosen. It's in her blood, as it was in yours.

JIMMY
Please, Castiel. Me, just take me. Take me, please.

DEAN, SAM, and AMELIA approach, but hold back when they see CASTIEL (still in CLAIRE's body) and JIMMY talking.

CASTIEL
I wanna make sure you understand. You won't die or age. If this last year was painful for you, picture a hundred, a thousand more like it.

JIMMY
It doesn't matter. You take me. Just take me.

CASTIEL
As you wish.

CASTIEL touches JIMMY'S face and a bright light emanates from his eyes and mouth. CLAIRE drops to her hands and knees, and CASTIEL, now in JIMMY's body, stands up. He walks past AMELIA and stands next to SAM and DEAN. AMELIA runs to CLAIRE and embraces her. AMELIA and CASTIEL's eyes meet, and then he turns to go.

DEAN
Cas, hold up. What were you gonna tell me?

CASTIEL
I learned my lesson while I was away, Dean. I serve heaven, I don't serve man, and I certainly don't serve you.

CASTIEL walks away while DEAN and SAM watch.



Act Five
INT. IMPALA – SAME NIGHT

DEAN drives through the rain in silence.

SAM
All right, let's hear it.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Drop the bomb, man. You saw what I did. Come on, stop the car, take a swing.

DEAN
I'm not gonna take a swing.

SAM
Then scream, chew me out.

DEAN
I'm not mad, Sam.

SAM
Come on. You're not mad?

DEAN
Nope.

SAM
Right. Look, at least let me explain myself.

DEAN
Don't. I don't care.

SAM
You don't care?

DEAN
What do you want me to say, that I'm disappointed? Yeah, I am. But, mostly, I'm just tired, man. I'm done. I am just done.

SAM's cellphone rings. He answers it.

SAM
Hey, Bobby.

We see BOBBY leaving the panic room, a bed set up behind him.

BOBBY
Hey, you and your brother better shag ass to my place ASAP.

SAM
What's going on?

BOBBY
The apocalypse, genius. Now get your asses over here.

SAM hangs up his phone.

DEAN
What'd he say?



INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY, SAM, and DEAN approach the door to the panic room.

BOBBY
Well, thanks for shaking a tail.

DEAN
Yeah, you got it.

SAM opens the door.

BOBBY
Go on inside. I wanna show you something.

SAM walks into the panic room while DEAN and BOBBY hang back.

SAM
All right. So, uh, what's the big demon problem?

BOBBY
You are. This is for your own good.

DEAN and BOBBY close and lock the door, and SAM walks to the barred window.

SAM
Guys? Hey, hey. What?

BOBBY closes and latches the window.

SAM (CONT'D)
This isn't funny. Guys! Hey! Guys?
