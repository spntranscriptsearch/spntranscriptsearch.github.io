TEASER
(Crowley walking down a corridor in Hell, looking scared. He is attacked by Guthrie and several other demons with knives. They stab him repeatedly.)

ROWENA

Son? Fergus!

(Crowley wakes up, sitting on his throne. Rowena is in front of him.)

ROWENA

What’s the matter?

CROWLEY

Nothing.

ROWENA

Nothing? You’re soaked in the horror sweat! Haven’t seen that since the plague years. Darling, what can I do?

CROWLEY

Not a thing, you evil bitch.

ROWENA

”Not a thing you evil bitch” mother.

CROWLEY

Let’s not get too cozy just yet.

(Crowley leaves the room. Rowena pulls a hex bag out from the throne.)

Title card: SUPERNATURAL

ACT ONE
(Dean is sitting on his bed in the bunker, holding his right arm. Images of Dean’s Mark-fuelled killings. He gets up and looks at himself in a mirror, which is divided in three parts by cracks running from side to side.)

(Scene changes to Castiel pacing in the bunker library.)

CASTIEL

She barely speaks to me.

(Sam comes into view, sitting.)

CASTIEL

She’s like a wounded animal, just watching me.

SAM

Look, Cas, you know what? You really tried to do the right thing that night. You did. This guy Claire was hanging out with, Randy, all he did was use her.

CASTIEL

Well, she thought he was kind. And for that, she loved him. Shows how little kindness there was in her life. You know, whatever Randy did, he didn’t deserve –

SAM

No, yeah, I know, I know. I hear you. Dean has had to kill before. We both have. But that was –

DEAN

That was what?

(Sam rises, surprised. Dean walks in from the war room.)

SAM

Dean.

DEAN

That was a massacre. That’s what it was. (Dean looks from Sam to Cas.)

DEAN

There was a time I was a hunter, not a stone-cold killer?

(Cas and Sam look troubled.)

DEAN

You can say it. You’re not wrong. I crossed the line. Guys, this thing’s gotta go.

(Dean looks down at the Mark of Cain on his arm.)

CASTIEL

That won’t be easy.

DEAN

Well, then burn it off! Cut it off.

CASTIEL

It is more than just a physical thing. It will take a very powerful force to remove the effect.

SAM

Dean, we have been through all the lore. There’s nothing.

CASTIEL

This reaches back to the time of creation. It may pre-date the lore. If we had the demon tablet, maybe.

SAM

But you said it was missing.

CASTIEL

It is.

(Castiel looks reluctant to say what he says next:)

CASTIEL

There may be another way.

(Scene change: Crowley’s throne room in Hell. It’s empty. Rowena comes in through the door. She’s looking for something, opening a chest and a closet, but not finding it.)

GUTHRIE

Ah, may I help you?

(Rowena turns, surprised. Guthrie comes into view behind her.)

GUTHRIE

His majesty didn’t want you wandering around unattended. Certainly not in here.

ROWENA

Och, I was just looking for a wee scrap of food. That swill they bring me, hardly fit for the mother of the king.

GUTHRIE

I wouldn’t know. I don’t eat. If you please, I have my orders.

(Cyril indicates the exit.)

ROWENA

Oh, you poor dear man. Guthrie, is it? Terrified of displeasing him, aren’t you? I know how my son can be. You’re all scared spitless. Still, a boy listens to his mum. I’d be happy to put in a good word for you.

GUTHRIE

I’m fine, thank you.

(Crowley opens the door and enters, holding a contract and a pen.)

CROWLEY

Guthrie. Whatever this is, it bores me rigid. Do I sign or not?

GUTHRIE

I found it in order, sir. Do sign.

(Crowley signs the contract and hands it to Guthrie. Guthrie nods at Rowena and leaves.)

CROWLEY

Mommy. Bored? Suicidal? Both?

ROWENA

Hardly, my dear. I’m learning so much. This place of yours? Poor thing. I see now why you are the way you are.

(Crowley sits on the throne. He looks questioning.)

ROWENA

My goodness! The discontent, the gossip, the plotting.

CROWLEY

Plotting?

ROWENA

Aye! And that one –

(Rowena points in the direction where Guthrie left.)

ROWENA

Worst of the lot. Watch yourself around him, mark my word.

CROWLEY

You do realize that’s exactly what you said about the guard, Gerald, down in the cells.

ROWENA

And was I not right? I know, I know, you mistrust me, and I earned that, and it’s a pity, because more than any of your other subjects, I wish you success.

CROWLEY

I know what you’re up to here, mother.

ROWENA

Do you, dear?

CROWLEY

You are shamelessly sucking up so that I’ll free you, so you can run amok and gum up my operation once again. No, thank you.

ROWENA

Flee schmee. Why would I want to be free when I can be here with my son? Does it hurt that you are the king and there are advantages for me in that? No. But more important, I’m a mother. Sue me, I’m proud.

CROWLEY

Excuse me if I don’t curl up in your lap. You did manage to stay away for three hundred years.

ROWENA

Please, we’ve been over this. The locals were going to try me for witchcraft and that never ends well. I had to flee.

CROWLEY

You could have sent for me!

ROWENA

Well, then came the chance to study under the great Milanese witch, Leticia D’albioni… And then there was unpleasantness with the grand coven. Anyway, it was no environment for a child!

CROWLEY

So locking me away in a squalid workhouse was your solution?

ROWENA

I will not apologize for being a career woman! Besides, what’s three hundred years, more or less, to folks like us? Nothing. I’m back now.

(Rowena licks her thumb and smooths Crowley’s eyebrow with it.)

ROWENA

We can be a family.

(Crowley scoffs mildly.)

(Scene change: the playground with the portal to Heaven. Castiel paces. He is watched by two guard angels, one in a woman’s vessel, the other in a little girl’s.)

CASTIEL

They should be here by now. Was there word of a delay?

WOMAN ANGEL

All I do is watch the door. Who are you expecting, Castiel?

(The portal opens. Ingrid and another angel come through escorting a prisoner with a hood over his head.)

CASTIEL

Thank you, Ingrid.

INGRID

I did as you asked at great risk, Castiel.

CASTIEL

I know. I approached you because I know you share my belief that it is angels’ mission to protect humans. It’s possible I can eliminate a great threat to them, but I will need his help.

INGRID

He must be returned intact. Is that clear?

CASTIEL

Yes.

(Castiel takes the prisoner. Ingrid and her companion leave through the portal. Castiel takes off the prisoner’s hood and reveals Metatron.)

METATRON

Told you last time I saw you I’d get out of the slammer.

CASTIEL

It’s temporary, trust me.

METATRON

Well, speaking of temporary, you must’ve borrowed some more grace. You’re looking very good. Of course, we both know that won’t last. Is that why I’m here? You think I’m gonna help you?

CASTIEL

This isn’t about me.

METATRON

Of course not. The great Castiel never stoops to such selfishness. So what is it then?

(The camera pans to Castiel’s Lincoln. Sam opens the front passenger door and gets out.)

METATRON

Oh, I see. I’m betting you didn’t tell Ingrid about him. Hello, Sam! Here to kill me?

(Scene change: the MoL bunker exterior.)

METATRON (voiceover)

Lovely room.

(Scene change: Metatron is sitting in a chair in the MoL dungeon. Sam approaches him.)

METATRON

It’s where you bring the kinky chicks, am I right?

SAM

I’ll ask the questions here.

(Sam puts chains around Metatron.)

SAM

You… Your only job is to provide information.

METATRON

Ah. Well, information does happen to be a specialty. Got about two billion fun facts up here.

(Metatron points to his temple.)

METATRON

Of course, whether I choose to cough one up or not is another matter.

SAM

We need to know how to remove the Mark of Cain from Dean’s arm.

METATRON (looking incredulous)

What? He’s back? Because of the Mark? So… he’s a demon.

SAM

No.

METATRON

Okay, what then?

(Sam looks troubled.)

What, did he ”kill a human” or something? (Metatron uses finger quotes.)

(Sam crosses his arms.)

METATRON

He’s gone nuclear! Total, foaming at the mouth, balls-out maniac. Ah, haha – that’s fantastic!

SAM

Do you know how to remove it?

METATRON

Maybe. But here’s the thing. You expect any help out of me, you keep that crazy brother of yours on a short leash.

SAM

Buddy, I don’t care what happens to you. You killed my brother.

(Sam turns around to face Dean, who is walking into the dungeon.)

ACT TWO
(Street exterior, night. Outside Hotel Astoria. The hotel sign has seven white neon stars. Scene changes to inside a hotel room, where Claire is hurriedly packing. There’s a knock on the door. The door opens and Castiel enters.)

CLAIRE

I was hoping to be gone by the time you got back.

(Castiel closes the door behind him.)

CASTIEL

If you don’t like the room, we can find another one.

CLAIRE

It’s not the room, Castiel. It’s you. This isn’t going to work. I mean, come on. You look like my father. It is his body. But he’s dead, and I get it, you feel bad, but you… whoever you are, are nothing to me.

CASTIEL

Claire, that’s not true. I’m in large part responsible for the way your life has unfolded. I… I have a responsibility to help you.

CLAIRE

No, you don’t.

CASTIEL

Claire. You have seen things, you’ve been through things that no one your age should have. And you are adrift. I wanna – I wanna help you have a life.

CLAIRE

I have a life. I’m good with it. If what you mean is a normal life, well. That ship has sailed.

CASTIEL

Doesn’t have to be the case. You’re still young.

CLAIRE

Stop talking to me like you’re my father. You killed my father. And that friend of yours killed the last thing I had closest to family.

CASTIEL

Are you speaking of Randy? Family? A man had you in that room and Randy didn’t make a move to help you.

CLAIRE

Maybe because he was at gunpoint. Dean Winchester is a monster.

CASTIEL

It’s possible there is a little monster in all of us.

CLAIRE

You want me to trust you, and the fact that you’d even try to defend him just proves to me that I can’t.

CASTIEL

Claire…

CLAIRE

No, Castiel, I’m done! I have to be on my own.

(Claire leaves and closes the door behind her. The camera closes in on Castiel’s sorrowful face.)

METATRON (voiceover)

Ain’t life a bitch?

(Scene change: Metatron, still chained to the chair in the MoL dungeon.)

METATRON

Nebbishy little guy – me – always sticking it to the lunkhead jocks.

DEAN

You know what, screw the Mark. Let’s just kill him.

METATRON

Boy, he really is a mess.

(Camera pans to reveal Sam, sitting on a table corner next to Dean.)

METATRON

Who knew the Mark was so toxic? Well, actually, I did.

METATRON (to Dean)

You know it is going to own you sooner than later.

SAM

Yeah, so how do we get rid of it?

METATRON

What, just like that, social hour’s over?

SAM

Yes, and now we’re moving on to our keynote speaker.

DEAN

Which is you. With us asking the questions. And me taking the personal pleasure of carving the answers out of you.

METATRON

Now, just – whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there, badass! Lighten up! Why do you just assume I’m not gonna be helpful?

SAM

Because you’re a dickwad.

METATRON

But I’m your dickwad. I have a special place in my non-heart for you both. To which end – ta-daa! I’d be tickled to help you pop this biblical zit. To do it, you are gonna need one specific thing. Your old bud – the First Blade.

SAM

What?

METATRON (laughs)

As I said: ain’t life a bitch.

(Scene change: Dean and Sam walk into the MoL library.)

SAM

This is the single worst idea I’ve ever heard. You just whacked a whole house full of people, and that’s when the Blade was nowhere around. And now you wanna be in actual contact with it?

DEAN

We don’t know that I have to be in contact with it. All we know is that we need it.

SAM

No no, all we know is he says we need it. We don’t even know what he wants us to do with it.

DEAN

A step at a time, allright. We play it safe, we learn whatever the spell is, how it works and we keep the Blade out of my hands.

(Dean takes out his cell phone.)

SAM

Are you sure this isn’t the Mark making you want the damn thing? I mean, why would we trust anything Metatron says?

DEAN

I don’t trust Metatron.

SAM

You don’t tru– Then what?

DEAN

What’s his game if he is lying, okay? The Blade without me is useless. The Blade with me is trouble for him. (Dean makes a call and puts his phone to his ear.)

SAM

What does he want?

DEAN

I don’t know. But if we weren’t willing to take a shot, then what was the point of bringing him here? Unless you got a better idea.

(Scene change: Rowena is pouring tea, using a golden tea set, in Crowley’s throne room in Hell.)

ROWENA

Of course you recall the lovely lullaby I sang to you nightly after you fed the goat.

CROWLEY (sitting on his throne)

You never sung me a lullaby. You dosed me with whiskey until I passed out.

ROWENA

Even then, I had a touch for pharmacology. Your mum was a prodigy.

CROWLEY

Funny. Not what I called you.

(Crowley’s cell phone rings.)

CROWLEY

Business.

(Crowley answers the call.)

CROWLEY

Squirrel. It’s been a while. Back to your former self?

(MoL bunker corridor; Dean on cell phone, Sam behind him.)

DEAN

Crowley. We need to meet ASAP.

CROWLEY (in throne room)

Where?

(Crowley listens while Rowena watches him. Crowley ends the call and gets up from the throne.)

CROWLEY

I got to go. Urgent. Matter of state.

ROWENA

My son.

(Rowena straightens Crowley’s lapels.)

ROWENA

So important. Shall I wait dinner for you?

CROWLEY

You don’t cook. I don’t eat. It’s a perfect arrangement.

(Crowley teleports away.)

ROWENA

Not even a goodbye.

(Rowena looks around; she’s alone. She opens a drawer and takes out a pair of scissors. Humming The Road to Loch Lomond, she opens Crowley’s closet where at least six identical dark blue paisley ties are hanging side by side. Rowena cuts a strip of fabric from one of them.)

ACT THREE
(A pool table with red felt. An El Sol neon sign in the background; we’re in a bar. Claire is holding a pool cue, talking to Brit, who is also holding a pool cue.)

CLAIRE

After my mom split and went crazy, Randy was like a father to me. First, I lose my first dad, then I lose my second. And who killed him and trashed my life?

(Claire makes a shot.)

CLAIRE

The buddy of the guy who killed my first dad and wants to be my third dad.

BRIT (scoffs)

Wow, sounds just like my life.

TONY (also holding pool cue)

Complications and pain. That’s all family get you.

CLAIRE

Yes.

BRIT

That’s why me and Tony keep moving. No strings. Hey, why don’t you hang with us for a while and unload this whole mess?

CLAIRE

Um, you might wanna reconsider. People near me get pretty unlucky pretty fast.

(Claire’s cell phone rings, she looks at the screen.)

CLAIRE

Oh, my – that’s him again.

TONY

The guy who killed your second dad or the guy who killed your first dad?

CLAIRE

The second thing.

BRIT

Tell him to get lost.

CLAIRE

I did. He’s a turn-the-other-cheek kinda guy.

BRIT

Hon. You seem real sweet, but sweetness don’t clean up messes.

CLAIRE

Yeah.

(Scene change: Street exterior, night. Dean and Sam are standing in front of a brick wall covered in graffiti.)

DEAN

Really, Crowley? Radio silence?

SAM

Say something.

(Camera pans to Crowley, facing them.)

CROWLEY

You want me do to what??

SAM

We need you to bring back –

CROWLEY

Bring back the Blade? I don’t think so.

(Scene change: Rowena, humming bagpipe music, is attaching strips of Crowley’s ties to a hex object.)

(Back in the alleyway with Dean, Sam and Crowley.)

DEAN

You don’t have to give the ting to me.

CROWLEY

I should say not.

DEAN

No no, just retrieve it and hang onto it until we need it.

CROWLEY

You, moose, you’re the sane one. You onboard with this?

(Scene change to Rowena in Crowley’s throne room.)

ROWENA

Wings of Titania, bear mine eyes aloft as I bid thee.

(Rowena finishes the spell and gasps. Her eyes roll up into her head, as her spell leads her inner sight to Crowley, who is still with Sam and Dean in the dark alleyway. Rowena sees and hears this:)

CROWLEY

Insane. You want me to procure the most dangerous weapon on the planet for Dean Winchester, the man who goes mental every time he touches it! I thought you’d wanna go for a beer, catch a film.

SAM

Look, if this plan works…

CROWLEY

It’s not a plan. It’s a probable death sentence for me and my kind.

SAM

If it works, it’s better for you. Look, when the Mark is gone, the Blade can’t operate.

DEAN

Win-win. Huh? Win-win.

CROWLEY

Stop that. It can’t operate. It’s hidden.

(Scene change to Rowena, still with her eyes showing only the whites, still listening.)

DEAN (voiceover)

Okay, the Blade might be powered down, but the Mark is not. I’m doing everything I can to keep it together.

(Scene change back to Dean, seen from above – Rowena’s vantage point.)

DEAN

You think the body count around me is high right now? Wait till Hal takes over.

SAM

We figure you stashed the Blade somewhere far away…

CROWLEY

Damn right. It’s in a crypt with my bones.

(Scene change: Rowena raises her eyebrows.)

SAM (voiceover)

All right, well?

(Scene change back to Crowley)

CROWLEY

I hate Guam this time of year.

(Rowena’s inner sight retracts back into her body. She’s sitting in Crowley’s throne room in Hell, smiling into the camera.)

ACT FOUR
(Crowley’s throne room in Hell. Guthrie is tidying up scrolls.)

GUTHRIE

And why is this imperial communiqué coming through you? The king always deals with me mano a mano.

ROWENA

Well, the king, my son, had pressing affairs, and asked me, his mother, to speak with you, his most trusted… underling. He said, ”Only Guthrie can be trusted with this task.”

GUTHRIE

I don’t know.

ROWENA

It’s not your place to know, just to obey. I did mention that as His Majesty’s mother, I have an unerring sense of what or who is best for my son, yes?

GUTHRIE

Ad nauseam.

ROWENA

You will recall, it was I who exposed the traitor Gerald. The one the king executed. Turns out not all demons are nice. And I am a tigress when it comes to my bonny lad.

GUTHRIE

What is this task the king requires?

ROWENA

Your resumé indicates you were a crossroads demon before your promotion?

GUTHRIE

I was.

ROWENA

Then you do travel, is that not correct?

(Scene change: MoL bunker, interior. Castiel comes in through the front door.)

CASTIEL

The First Blade is back in play and Crowley is the one getting it?

(Sam, sitting at the table in the war room below, looks up at Castiel, surprised.)

CASTIEL

I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but you –

DEAN

Yeah well, you know us.

(Dean walks in from the library, holding a beer bottle.)

DEAN

When we screw ourselves we like to go whole hog.

CASTIEL

This would be the Crowley who let the Blade turn Dean into a demon?

(Castiel walks down the stairs into the war room.)

DEAN

I don’t have a choice, ’kay? I don’t do this, I’m down the rabbit hole. Hear evil, see evil, do evil. The trifecta.

SAM

Cas, look. Let us worry about this. You’ve got enough on your plate with Claire.

CASTIEL

Claire is gone.

SAM

Gone where?

CASTIEL

I don’t know, I – I should have stopped her. But I am certain that she is destined for more trouble and disappointment. She is so… so full of rage.

DEAN

Listen, man, if I could make it better I would.

CASTIEL

It’s actually why I’m here. I was hoping you might reach out to her.

DEAN

Me?

CASTIEL

Yes.

DEAN

Seriously, I’m probably the last person she would wanna hear from.

CASTIEL

I thought there would be a connection. One extremely messed up human to another, you could explain why you murdered her only friend.

DEAN

Oh, well, yeah, when you put it like that.

CASTIEL

All I know…

(Castiel sits down opposite Dean.)

CASTIEL

… is she won’t talk to me. I thought if she understood the kind of man Randy was and the danger she was in, she might…

DEAN

What the hell, why not? Long shots seem to be the theme around here. I’m gonna go make a sandwich.

CASTIEL

I’ll, uh – I’ll text you her number.

DEAN

Okay.

CASTIEL (cell phone in hand)

I like texting. Emoticons?

(Dean leaves the room.)

CASTIEL

He seems calm. Considering the effects of the Mark. Metatron in proximity.

SAM

Too calm. I think he’s worried about what’ll happen if he pops the cork.

(Scene change: a crypt. Crowley walks in and blows the dust off the lid of the marble sarcophagus, which bears the name MACLEOD. He opens the lid to reveal a skeleton and an ornate box. He takes out the box and opens it, but it only contains a First Blade-shaped nothing.)

(Scene change: Rowena is sitting on Crowley’s throne in Hell. Guthrie opens the door and walks in, holding a briefcase. He sees Rowena and clears his throat.)

ROWENA

Oh! Ooooh – sciatica! I need a firm chair.

GUTHRIE

So I see. I have it. This is my responsibility. I’ll deliver it only to the king.

ROWENA

You have demonstrated unimpeachable loyalty, Guthrie. You, more than any, deserve this reward from a grateful monarch.

(Rowena stabs Guthrie with an angel blade. Guthrie’s eyes and mouth light up with demon fire as he burns out.)

ROWENA

Don’t screw with me, sycophant.

CROWLEY

What in hell…?

(Rowena looks up at Crowley who walks in, looking down at Guthrie’s body.)

ROWENA

Exactly! What the hell is going on in Hell?? You said Guthrie was one of your best, your most trusted, and yet I found him inciting unrest amongst the court.

CROWLEY

Can’t be true.

ROWENA

Can’t it? He said you were colluding with someone called – Winchester? Yes? And that you were going to fetch him, what was it – the First Blade? Which could kill us all! He said he got it first because you couldn’t be trusted. Naturally I confronted him, and he attacked me! I had no choice.

CROWLEY

I had a vision. Of Guthrie, attacking me.

ROWENA

A prophecy. I am an interpreter of signs.

(Crowley squats down and takes the First Blade from Guthrie’s briefcase.)

CROWLEY

It’s not possible.

ROWENA

I know, sonny – and yet.

CROWLEY

How could he have known?

ROWENA

Spies everywhere. I did try to warn you. Fergus – these Winchesters he mentioned, they’re not the hunter Winchesters, are they? Because they too could be a great danger for us. I mean, today we got lucky, but tomorrow, who knows? Who is there left for you to trust?

(Scene change: outdoors, night. A small woodfire is burning.)

BRIT

Oh, we loved living there. It was our dream house.

(She’s talking to Claire. They’re both sitting in lawn chairs. Tony comes out from a beat-up camper behind them.)

TONY

Of course the family came home from vacation. Screwed up everything.

(Tony hands a beer each to the girls.)

BRIT

Haha! I just about peed myself when the wife pulled that gun out of her purse.

TONY

Haha! We tore outta there and ran two miles bare-ass naked.

(Claire puts her cell phone to her ear.)

DEAN (on recording)

Hey, it’s Dean. Look, Claire, we need to talk in person. Just tell me where, okay? Call me.

TONY

That him again? The guy that caused you so much grief?

CLAIRE

Worse. Dean Winchester. The one who butchered Randy.

BRIT

And why? What was this Dean’s connection to Randy?

CLAIRE

He didn’t even know him. Or the others. And he gutted them. And I saw him standing there, soaked in blood. Looking like he enjoyed it. And now he wants to meet. And talk.

TONY

Maybe you should.

CLAIRE

What?

BRIT

Me and Tony are worried for you. This guy around, you’re always gonna be looking over your shoulder.

TONY

We’ve handled situations like this before. We could take care of him so they won’t bother you anymore.

BRIT

Beat him up bad.

TONY

Or… something more permanent.

(Claire smiles at Tony.)

(Scene change: Dean is in the MoL kitchen, taking sandwich fixings out of the fridge. His cell phone plays rock music. He picks up.)

DEAN

Yeah.

CROWLEY (over phone)

Squirrel!

(closeup on Crowley, holding the First Blade.)

CROWLEY

I’ve got it.

(Scene change back to DEAN)

That’s good to hear.

(Scene change to Crowley, sitting on his throne in Hell.)

CROWLEY

Of course I’m gonna hang onto it until you work out how to get that thing off your arm.

(Back to Dean, who ends the call.)

(Scene change: Metatron is still sitting in the dungeon. Dean walks in.)

METATRON

I’m guessing you’re not here to reminisce.

DEAN

All right, we did what you said. We have the First Blade.

METATRON

Not here? Not on your person.

DEAN

Not saying. So back to you. What’s next?

METATRON

This is where it gets kind of interesting.

DEAN

Uh-huh.

METATRON

It’s very lonely here. And I have little to do but think. And it occurred to me that you really need this Mark taken off of you. And in order to do that, you really need me. So here’s the deal. That first little tip I gave you? A freebie. Just cause you’re you. Every future step – they’re gonna cost you. Big. Oh, and FYI, there’s a bunch.

(Dean pulls out an angel blade, slams it on the table and goes to close the door.)

METATRON

Whatcha doing there, Slugger?

(Dean locks the door.)

DEAN

I’m settling a score that’s taken way too long to settle. Oh, and while I do that, I’m gonna get some information.

(Dean picks up the angel blade and walks up to Metatron.)

DEAN

And I’m gonna enjoy every minute of it. Because you’re gonna tell me everything. All of it. And it ain’t gonna cost me a damn dime. Slugger.

ACT FIVE
(The MoL dungeon with Metatron and Dean, exactly as we left them.)

DEAN

All right. I’m gonna ask this exactly once, before it gets ugly. What is the next step in removing the Mark?

METATRON

I repeat my offer. Each step costs you.

DEAN

You’re confused. See, each step you don’t give me – is gonna cost you. And it’s been a long time coming. I mean, where do I begin? Stealing Cas’s grace. Casting out the angels. Making Gadreel kill Kevin using my brother’s hands. Starting an angel war. And, oh yeah, you killed me.

METATRON (scoffs)

My morality is being judged by Dean Winchester? How many people have suffered and died because they believed in you? How many times have you lied to Sam, including, oh by the way, when he was possessed by an angel? And you say, ”Oh well, it’s all for the greater good.” But lately, buddy? That greater good thing just went away, didn’t it? Now, people die just because you want them to.

(Dean punches Metatron in the face.)

METATRON (grunts, then chuckles)

Good, Dean. Go darker.

(Dean punches Metatron again.)

METATRON (bleeding at the mouth)

Go deeper!

(Dean punches Metatron four times.)

METATRON (now also bleeding from the nose)

Surely you’ve noticed, every time you respond when the Mark gets you all twitchy, you fall deeper under its spell. You think roughing up a few humans and demons makes it worse? Try messing with the scribe of God, bucko!

(Scene change: MoL war room. Cas walks up behind Sam.)

CASTIEL

It’s late. I’m gonna drive around a little bit, see if I can find Claire.

SAM

Right now?

CASTIEL

I have to try.

SAM

Well, be careful.

(Sam looks into the empty kitchen.)

SAM

Wait, Cas? Where’s Dean?

(They exchange a look and take off at a dead run down the corridor.)

(Scene change: Dean punches Metatron in the dungeon.)

METATRON (panting and bleeding from a blackened eye)

And Kevin’s death? All on you. You put him in harm’s way and kept him there. Gadreel possessing Sam? Who was it that tricked Sam into letting him in? Oh, and then my personal favorite: Dean Winchester. Whose entire existence is defined by a war on the dark and monstrous – bromancing his way around the country with the king of Hell!

(Dean punches Metatron twice.)

DEAN

Let’s try this again. What is the next step?

METATRON

What is it you humans say so inelegantly? Oh, yes – go screw yourself.

(Sam runs up outside the dungeon, followed by Cas. Dean grabs the angel blade from the table. Sam tries to open the dungeon door, but it’s locked. He pounds on the door.)

SAM

Dean?!

(Inside the dungeon.)

DEAN

Now it’s time to get serious.

(Knocking on door.)

SAM (from outside)

Dean!

(Dean puts the blade against Metatron’s throat.)

DEAN

What is the next step in removing this Mark from my arm?

SAM (from outside)

Dean, open the door.

(Scene change: the corridor outside the dungeon. Sam is pounding on the door, Cas is standing behind him.)

SAM

Hey, open the door!

(Back to the dungeon: Dean cuts Metatron’s face. There’s a glimmer of angel grace from the wound. Dean places the angel blade at Metatron’s throat.)

DEAN

What is…

(The corridor: Sam bodyslams the door.)

(The dungeon.)

DEAN

… the next step??

(Dean rips Metatron’s shirt open and starts cutting down his sternum. Blood and grace seeps out. Metatron screams.)

(Outside, Sam kicks the door to no avail. Castiel shoves him out of the way.)

CASTIEL

Move!

(Castiel raises his arm.)

(The dungeon. The Mark on Dean’s arm glows red.)

METATRON

Behold, the river shall end at the source.

(The corridor. Castiel’s eyes glow and he sends grace from the palm of his hand to shatter the dungeon door. He looks winded, and Sam runs past him into the dungeon, where Dean is holding the angel blade against Metatron’s chest.)

SAM

No, Dean! Hey, stop, stop.

(Sam grabs Dean and pulls him away. Castiel checks on Metatron.)

SAM

You were killing him.

CASTIEL

I have to take him back.

SAM

Cas, this won’t happen again.

CASTIEL

I gave my word. I have fences to mend in Heaven, and as it is, I have a lot to explain.

METATRON

If you ever ask me for help again, I will choose death. You realize it’s going to get worse, Dean. You’re gonna get worse!

(Castiel drags Metatron away.)

(New scene: MoL library. Dean is sitting at the table, holding his head in his hands. Sam walks in.)

SAM

Hey. You okay?

DEAN

He said the river ends at the source.

SAM

What does that mean?

DEAN

Maybe nothing. It was the last thing he said before you guys busted in.

SAM

Dean. Look, man, we had to…

DEAN

Hey, no. I get it, all right. I – I was gonna kill him. And I couldn’t stop myself.

SAM

We’ll figure it out, all right? You know what Cas said about needing a powerful force?

DEAN

Yeah, so?

SAM

So, I’ve been thinking. Look. Cain still has the Mark, right?

(Dean nods.)

SAM

And he’s lived with it. For years, he’s lived with it. So yeah, the Mark is strong, but – Dean, maybe there’s a part of you that wants to give in to it. And maybe you have to fight that, you know? Maybe… part of that powerful force has to be you.

(Dean’s cell phone plays rock music. Dean picks up.)

DEAN

Yeah.

CLAIRE (over the phone)

It’s Claire.

(Scene change: outside, at night. Claire is in the camp ground.)

CLAIRE

I’ve thought it over.

(Claire walks up to Tony, sitting by the camp fire.)

CLAIRE

Maybe it’s only fair to hear your side of it. I mean, Castiel seemed to trust you, a lot.

(Claire sits down between Tony and Brit.)

DEAN (over the phone)

Yeah, okay, where do you wanna meet?

(Scene change: lakeside, day. The Impala drives up to Tony’s and Brit’s camper. Dean is alone in the car. Claire looks at him through the camper window. Dean gets out of the car. Brit is lurking in the bushes, holding a bat. Dean sits on the park bench. Tony is also lurking behind him. Claire watches them sneak up on Dean. Tony is holding an axe.)

(Suddenly, Claire gets up and runs to the open camper door.)

CLAIRE

No!

(Dean turns his head, sees her, then looks around, alarmed. Brit swings her bat for him, but he ducks. Tony and Claire run toward Dean, who takes Brit in a choke hold using the bat. Tony attacks Dean, who shoves Brit to the side and, after a brief struggle, shoves Tony down on the ground next to her. Dean picks up the axe.)

CLAIRE

No!

(Dean raises the axe. Tony flinches.)

CLAIRE

No, no!

Dean forcefully swings the axe – into the park bench. Tony and Brit run off, unharmed. Dean faces Claire. She turns around and goes back into the camper. Dean leaves.)

(New scene: road through wooded area, day. Castiel’s Lincoln drives into view. Claire is walking along the road. Castiel talks to her through the driver’s side window while coasting alongside her.)

CASTIEL

Claire!

CLAIRE

How the hell did you find me?

CASTIEL

Angels are able to find those who pray to them.

CLAIRE

Pray? Oh believe me, I gave up praying a long time ago.

CASTIEL

Well, it doesn’t have to be a formal prayer. I could pick up on a – a longing… Perhaps you wanted to tell me something?

CLAIRE

No.

(Claire stops walking.)

CLAIRE

I don’t know. Maybe.

(Castiel turns off the car engine.)

CLAIRE

I guess I just…

(Castiel gets out of the car.)

CLAIRE

…wanted to tell you that I – I thought about what you said. I’m gonna try doing things a little bit different. Let go of the little bit of monster in me.

CASTIEL

Well, I could try to help you with that.

CLAIRE

I still gotta go it alone. But I could – maybe call sometime? Now get out of here, would you? No one’s gonna pick me up with that butt-ugly car sitting there.

CASTIEL

I’ll see you, Claire.

CLAIRE

Oh, hey. Not that you care, but I like you better in a tie.

(Castiel smiles. He gets back in the car and drives off.)
