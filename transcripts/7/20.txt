EXT. CABIN – DAY


INT. CABIN – DAY


SAM is talking on his cell phone. The wall behind him is covered with research.


SAM
Yeah, I hear you. All right. Well, thanks for looking. Yep. Bye.


SAM hangs up.


SAM
So, Nora didn’t see any pattern to the dig sites either.


SAM sits down on the sofa.


DEAN
Yeah, 'cause they got nothing in common.


DEAN sits on the arm of the sofa.


DEAN
And I got nothing from local lore 50 miles in every direction of all of them. I mean, it's like they're just... old dirt. What’s Dick looking for?


DEAN takes a drink from his flask. The lights flicker. SAM and DEAN both stand up and take guns out of their jeans. BOBBY appears and they point their guns at him.


BOBBY
Hey, hey, go easy, you idjits. Sorry for the jump scare.


DEAN
So how does this work, huh? I leave the cap off and you just genie your way out?


BOBBY
I wish it were that easy. The thing –


BOBBY flickers and vanishes.


SAM
Bobby?


BOBBY reappears.


BOBBY
Damn it. It’s hard to stay focused. I’m still kind of worn out.


DEAN
You’ve been pretty busy for a dead guy.


BOBBY
All right. Listen. I-I don't know how long before my next ghost nap, so let's just skip to the skinny – those numbers I gave you.


[Flashback to BOBBY writing “45489” on SAM’s hand in 7.10 Death's Door and DEAN looking at the same numbers on a clipboard in 7.11 Adventures in Babysitting.]


DEAN
The empty lot in Cheeseville?


BOBBY
Yeah, well, it ain't gonna be empty for long.


[Flashback to BOBBY looking at DICK ROMAN’s papers in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters.]


BOBBY
I got a gander at Dick's big plan, right before he Lincolned me.


[Flashback to DICK ROMAN shooting at BOBBY as BOBBY tries to get into the van with SAM and DEAN in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters.]


BOBBY
They're breaking ground – what month is this?


SAM
Uh – uh, April.


BOBBY sighs.


BOBBY
Ground’s broke.


[Flashback to DICK ROMAN’s employees in the field, and FRANK and DEAN in FRANK’s trailer, in 7.11 Adventures in Babysitting:


FRANK
They're surveying. They're getting ready to build something.


DEAN
Build what?


FRANK
Exactly. What?]


BOBBY
They’re building as we’re yammering. Check it out yourself. It's all right. I mean, you guys missed it because you've been kind of busy [SAM opens the laptop] killing ghosts the past few days. But Dick is about to get into the Soylent Green business.


[Flashbacks to the meat delivery to the Biggerson’s warehouse in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters.]


BOBBY
That site'll show you they're building a biotech lab, right?


The laptop screen shows Geothrive’s “Standard plans for an efficient slaughterhouse”.


BOBBY
Biotech my ass.


[Flashbacks to the meat delivery truck and one of the caged hyper-aggressive humans who reacted badly to the Turducken in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters.]


BOBBY
That sucker is a state-of-the-art slaughterhouse. And we're the beef.


[Flashback to BRANDON, the waiter who reacted badly to the Turducken, being led into a cage in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters.]


DEAN
Don't you think that's a little bold, even for Dick?


BOBBY
I bet you no one will even notice…


[Flashback to the Biggerson’s restaurant in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters. DEAN and many of the patrons are eating Turducken sandwiches.]


BOBBY
… 'cause first, he's gonna dumb us all down with Turducken-style munchies.


[Flashback to SAM taking DEAN’s partly-eaten Turducken sandwich away from him in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters.]


BOBBY
Make us docile.


[Flashback to gray goo erupting from DEAN’s Turducken sandwich, and BOBBY in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters:


BOBBY
It's in the meat.]


DEAN
Yeah, we haven't been to Biggerson's since that whole fiasco.


BOBBY
Biggerson's? He's bought a list of joints 10 pages long.


DEAN
Ah.


BOBBY
Next, he's gonna cure us.


SAM
Cure us of what?


[Flashback to DICK ROMAN and other Leviathans watching the family eat in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters.]


BOBBY
All the biggies – cancer, AIDS, heart disease. Let's just say they got an affinity for stem-cell research.


DEAN
The, uh, Leviathan real-estate mooks building that cancer center.


[Flashback to GEORGE and DEAN in 7.16 Out with the Old:


GEORGE
It's going to be a research center.


DEAN
Research for what?]


BOBBY
They're not hunting anymore. They're engineering the perfect herd.


[Flashback to DICK ROMAN and other Leviathans watching the family eat in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters:


DICK ROMAN
With the very first dose, it starts to work on their DNA, slowing their metabolism, causing weight gain, and dampening their emotional range, which makes them perfectly complacent.]


BOBBY
Now, we've gone up against plenty liked to eat a few folk in the woods. This ain't that. This is about knocking us off the top of the food chain. This is about them Levis living here forever, one-percenter style, while we march our dopey, fat asses down to the shiny new death camps at every corner.


CUT TO: A WOMAN plugging a hard drive into a computer. She drags the “external volume” icon on her screen across to a box that says “Drop harddrive here to decrypt” and types rapidly.


CUT TO: SAM’s laptop beeps. His email program reads “You have 1 new message.” The top email is from Frank and is titled “I’m probably dead…”


SAM
It's an e-mail... [He opens the email.] From Frank.


DEAN
Frank's alive?


BOBBY
That jackass, always stealing my thunder.


SAM
"Sam and Dean, if you're reading this, I'm dead... or worse. This e-mail was sent because some prince is trying to hack into my hard drive right this second. So unless it's you, you got trouble."


CUT TO: the WOMAN trying to access the hard drive.


SAM
Um, okay. "My drive is full of compromising info. Your new aliases, hangouts, where you stored your car..."


DEAN
Baby?


SAM
Even though he encrypted the crap out of his drive, he says we should assume that someone can hack into it eventually. He did put a tracking device in it.


SAM clicks on a link in Frank’s email and a “Hard Drive Tracker” application appears on the laptop screen.


SAM
All right, let's see where Frank's drive is.


A box appears on the screen saying that the hard drive is at Richard Roman Enterprises.


DEAN
Perfect. It's in the middle of the Death Star.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – DAY


The WOMAN who attempted to hack into Frank’s hard drive pulls up on a yellow scooter in front of the building. She removes her goggles and helmet, puts on headphones and plays Katrina and the Waves’ “Walking on Sunshine” as she walks towards the building.


♪ I used to think maybe you loved me ♪


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – DAY


♪ Now, baby, I'm sure ♪


The WOMAN enters the building and swipes her pass card.


♪ And I just can't wait till the day ♪

♪ When you knock on my door ♪


The WOMAN walks bouncily across the foyer in time to the music. A security guard’s computer screen shows her picture and name – Charlie Bradbury – and reads “Access Granted”.


♪ Now every time I go for the mailbox ♪

♪ Gotta hold myself down ♪


CHARLIE swipes her pass card in the elevator and presses a button for the fourth floor.


♪ 'Cause I just can’t wait ♪

♪ Till you write me you're coming around ♪


CHARLIE looks around, smiles and starts to dance vigorously.


♪ Now, I'm walking on sunshine ♪

♪ Whoa ♪

♪ I'm walking on sunshine ♪

♪ Whoa ♪


The elevator arrives at CHARLIE’s floor. She composes herself and walks out.


♪ I'm walking on sunshine ♪

♪ Whoa ♪

♪ And don't it feel good? ♪

♪ Hey ♪


CHARLIE turns off the music and removes her headphones as she walks to her desk. Her workspace is decorated with figurines and pictures from Star Wars, Harry Potter, Wonder Woman, etc. Next to her computer is a Hermione Granger figurine.


CHARLIE brings up a website for “The U.S. Conservatives – Keep America Strong” and transfers $10,000 from their account to “Animal Lovers & Lovers of the Planet”.


CO-WORKER
How'd it go last night? Charlie, it's a moral imperative you let me live vicariously through you.


CHARLIE
Pictures or it didn't happen, right?


CHARLIE hands her CO-WORKER her phone. Her computer screen now shows the “Animal Lovers” website online donations page. A message appears saying that the $10,000 funds transfer is complete.


CO-WORKER
You hooked up at a charity benefit?


CHARLIE
If you can't score at a reproductive rights function, then you simply cannot score.


CO-WORKER
Wait. Is that legal?


CHARLIE
We were two consenting adults.


The CO-WORKER rolls his chair over to look at CHARLIE’s computer screen.


CO-WORKER
No. That. Why do you insist on breaking the law on company property?


CHARLIE
Mmm, faster Internet connection here.


CO-WORKER
Oh, well, if Pete finds out, he's gonna fire you... or get you arrested.


CHARLIE
Teddy Bear Pete? Please. You know I've been doing this for like a month. I can cover my tracks, Harry. Trust me.


PETE
Charlie!


CHARLIE and HARRY stand up and look over the cubicle divider at PETE.


PETE
My office. Now.


HARRY
I love you.


CHARLIE
I know.


CHARLIE walks into PETE’s office. DICK ROMAN is there.


DICK ROMAN
Charlie Bradbury? Dick. Sit.


CHARLIE looks very nervous.


DICK ROMAN
Charlie, I've been running things for, well, feels like since before the dawn of man. Always had a vision. I'm close to realizing that dream. I don't want to brag, but the world is my dinner plate. And I don't want anything to jeopardize that – definitely not the actions of one tiny, little person.


CHARLIE
Sir, sir, I can fix this. Please – please don't fire me.


DICK ROMAN
What's she talking about?


PETE
I – I –


DICK ROMAN
Is that about hacking those Super PACs? 'Cause that was adorable. Tell me, how does a high-school dropout become one of the brightest minds at Roman, Inc.?


CHARLIE
Um... Honestly... Historically, I've had this problem with – with authority – no offense – so I realized the only way to get away with being me was to be as indispensable as possible. Sorry.


DICK ROMAN
You're kind of completing me right now, Charlie. You have that spark, that thing that makes humans so special. Not everyone has it, you know. Those people – they can be replaced. But people like you... are impossible to copy.


CHARLIE
C-copy?


DICK ROMAN
Take the compliment.


DICK ROMAN picks up a hard drive.


DICK ROMAN
This belonged to one Frank Devereaux. Thought he could bring down the whole company. He was wrong. Let's keep him wrong. It's encrypted [He gives the hard drive to CHARLIE], or whatever you crazy kids say these days. Break it open and bring it to me.


CHARLIE
Yeah, I'm on it. And – and thank you.


DICK ROMAN
You're welcome. You have three days or you're fired. Good talk.


DICK ROMAN leaves the office.


CHARLIE
Is this real life?


PETE stares at her with his mouth open.


CHARLIE walks past HARRY’s desk holding up the hard drive.


CHARLIE
Dick Roman gave me an assignment.


HARRY
Is that... good?


CHARLIE
It means the Eye of Sauron is on me.


HARRY
Well, if you need anything, I'll be back in the Shire.


CHARLIE plugs in the hard drive and looks at her Hermione figurine.


CHARLIE
All right, H. It's just you and me now.


CHARLIE drags the “external volume” icon on her screen across to a box that says “Drop harddrive here to decrypt” and types rapidly. A message appears:


LOGON: error. Access denied.


CHARLIE types more and gets the same "access denied" message several times.


Her screen reads:


‘Games’ refers to models, simulations and games which have tactical and strategic applications.


List Games


Falken’s Maze

Black Jack

Gin Rummy

Hearts

Bridge

Checkers

Chess

Poker


ELECTRONIC VOICE
How about a nice game of chess?


More games appear on the list on CHARLIE’s screen:


Fighter Combat

Guerrilla Engagement

Desert Warfare

Air-to-ground Actions

Theaterwide Tactical Warfare

Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare

Global Thermonuclear War


CHARLIE
Wait a second. Seriously? "Wargames"?


CHARLIE types “Joshua” to log on. The screen reads “Greetings Professor Falken.” CHARLIE smiles.


CHARLIE
Shall we play a game, bitches? [To her Hermione figurine] That was hardly the Chamber of Secrets, right? [She mock-fistbumps the Hermione figurine] Booyah.


The computer screen flickers.


ELECTRONIC VOICE
Shall – we – play – a – game?


A system alert appears on the screen: NICE TRY ZERO CHARISMA.


FRANK’S VOICE
Nice try, Zero Charisma.


CHARLIE sighs and addresses the Hermione figurine.


CHARLIE
And back to square one.


SAM (V-O)
Let's see where Frank's drive is.


INT. CABIN – DAY


SAM’s laptop shows the location of Frank’s hard drive at Richard Roman Enterprises.


DEAN
Perfect. It's in the middle of the Death Star. All right, well, off to Chicago.


DEAN stands up.


BOBBY
No, wait, boys, you can't just break in. They know your mugs. What if we mailed in the flask? Then I could ghost through the joint. I mean, it's not like Dick can kill me twice. What, you got a better plan? Come on. Just because I'm dead doesn't mean I don't know how to do my damn job.


SAM
Bobby, that's Dick's office.


DEAN
I think what Sam's trying to say is, what happens if you run into Dick and, you know... go vengeful. You know it's not something you can just shake off.


BOBBY
Come on. Give me some credit. What, I'm supposed to just ride the pine?


SAM
Sorry, Bobby.


SAM shuts the laptop and walks away. DEAN follows him.


EXT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – DAY


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – DAY


CHARLIE is asleep at her desk.


HARRY
Did you go home last night?


CHARLIE shakes her head.


HARRY
I'll get us some coffee. I assume you want some crack in yours.


CHARLIE
Yes, please.


CHARLIE’s computer screen is still running through the decryption process. There is a beep and CHARLIE looks up. The screen reads Access granted!


CHARLIE
Finally.


FRANK’s folders appear on the screen:


March of Dimes

Clones

Known Facts

Monsters


CHARLIE
Who is this d-bag?


One of the folders is labeled “Richard Roman Enterprises”.


CHARLIE
Don't do it. Roman said to bring it right to him. [She looks at the Hermione figurine] You're right, H. You're always right.


CHARLIE clicks on the folder labeled “Richard Roman Enterprises.” Video footage of the empty field from 7.11 Adventures in Babysitting, a Financial Markets Watch article about Richard Roman Enterprises, a drawing of a leviathan’s mouth, other articles and photographs, and handwritten notes open. CHARLIE clicks on what appear to be handwritten notes written by FRANK.


CHARLIE
What the frak's a Leviathan?


FRANK’S VOICE
The thing to know about Leviathan is these monsters are as old as time, and strong as all get-out. Sodium borate – commonly known as Borax. Decapitation… Splash them liberally. Repeat. …is the key. Then put that head in a box. These are the Superman of monsters. But don’t use… ...from the black hole of Purgatory. Send it to the moon if you can. They die. They can shapeshift… They don’t die easy. Take your face, your memory – the works. The top boss is Mr. Dick Roman. He runs the show.


CHARLIE hits a button and shakes her head, then hits another button.


FRANK’S VOICE
Cut one, you see black goo. We're through the looking glass. Blood is black, and black is blood. Don't turn your back. Get out of the building. Get out of the county.


CHARLIE hits a button and all of the open documents close. She gets up and looks in PETE’s office, which is empty.


HARRY
How goes it?


HARRY hands CHARLIE a cup of coffee.


CHARLIE
Pretty sure I spent the last 24 hours hacking into a loony bin. Where's Pete?


HARRY
Uh, probably snuck down to the garage for a smoky treat.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES GARAGE – DAY


PETE is walking to his car. He takes a packet of cigarettes from the driver’s seat, then turns to find DICK ROMAN and another MAN waiting for him.


DICK ROMAN
How's it going with that drive?


PETE
Uh, great. Charlie was here all night.


DICK ROMAN
You know, that drive's very important to me. I'm gonna want a watchful eye kept.


PETE
Well, I will do just that.


DICK ROMAN
No. You won't. Bruce Springsteen, Eli Manning, our own little Charlie – you know what they are? Irreplaceable. You're more of a Tim Tebow, Joe Biden type. You got no spark in you. In fact, there's nothing in you... except Tarrell's dinner.


DARYL grabs PETE’s arm and takes on PETE’s form. TARRELL’s his face transforms and he lunges at PETE. Blood splatters PETE’s car. CHARLIE, who was watching from some distance away, gasps and turns around.


INT. CHARLIE’S APARTMENT – DAY


CHARLIE enters, takes a bag from a cupboard and starts to pack. She pauses and looks around, then shakes her head and continues packing. Her phone rings.


CHARLIE
Hey, Pete, sorry I left without telling you.

No, I just wasn't... feeling well. It's a... lady thing. I will be in first thing. Got to go – cramps.


CHARLIE looks at Star Wars figurines on a shelf. The head of the Darth Vader figurine is moving. CHARLIE hurries for the door. As she opens it, DEAN slams it shut.


DEAN
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.


CHARLIE
Get away from me, you... [She picks up a plastic sword] shapeshifter!


SAM
Look, we're not shapeshifters.


CHARLIE slashes at SAM with the sword, breaking it.


SAM
Geez!


DEAN takes the broken sword away from CHARLIE.


DEAN
Look, we're not Leviathans, okay? You want us to prove it? You know what borax does to them?


CHARLIE
Yeah.


DEAN
Sam?


SAM holds out his hand and DEAN pours borax over it, then pours some over his own hand. He holds his hand up to show CHARLIE.


DEAN
Huh? Your turn.


DEAN gives CHARLIE the borax and she splashes some over one hand.


DEAN
Good.


DEAN takes back the borax.


CHARLIE
Who the hell are you guys?


A commercial plays, with images of a farm, the Statue of Liberty, the Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol building, a city, a shoreline, laboratory workers, farmers, a warehouse, a shipping wharf, an office tower, people eating at an outdoor table, two people eating corn on the cob, an American flag, and the “Sucrocorp” logo.


VOICE ON COMMERCIAL
America – a nation of greatness… a nation of hardworking individuals. And, rest assured, no one works harder for you than Sucrocorp. Here at Sucrocorp, your well-being is our number-one priority. Sucrocorp – eat well, live well.


ACT TWO
INT. CHARLIE’S APARTMENT – DAY


SAM and DEAN are sitting in CHARLIE’s living room.


CHARLIE
So you're saying, you guys are monster hunters. So, there are other monsters? Stop. Never mind. Just shh. Okay, I get how you tracked the drive – straight GPS – but it's still at the office. How did you find me?


SAM clears his throat and opens his laptop. He shows CHARLIE video footage of herself.


CHARLIE
Aw! Son of a gun jacked my webcam?!


DEAN
Welcome to Frank.


CHARLIE
It's creepy, but I'll give it to him. So you're telling me everything he had on his drive is true.


DEAN
That and more.


SAM
Wait. How long did it take you to crack into Frank's drive?


CHARLIE
A day or so.


SAM
Is there anything you can't hack into?


CHARLIE
Not yet.


SAM
How about Dick Roman's e-mail?


CHARLIE
Why would I... Oh. He's one of them.


SAM
No. Uh, he's their leader.


CHARLIE
So what's the end game – steal our resources, make us some slaves?


DEAN
Planet-wide value meal. We're the meat.


CHARLIE
You can't be... serious. Okay. All right. Let's do this. What am I looking for?


CHARLIE sits down at the table and opens her laptop. The desktop background is Arwen from The Lord of the Rings.


DEAN
Well, for starters, uh, anything about archaeological dig sites.


CHARLIE
Like Indiana Jones stuff?


DEAN
All we know is that Dick has been digging all over the world, and we need to know what he's looking for.


CHARLIE
You know, I was having a really good week. I met someone, downloaded the new Robyn album. Everything was coming up me. Oh, crap.


SAM
Look, we get it sucks.


CHARLIE
No, not that. This. Dick's e-mail isn't on the company server. It's on a private one, in his office.


DEAN
Meaning?


CHARLIE
Can't get in it unless you have his phone or you're at his desk.


DEAN
So you're saying that if we're inside Dick's office, then we can hack into his e-mail?


CHARLIE
You can't. Only someone like... But I sure as hell ain't doing it. I am doing my job and... What are the chances I see everything on that drive and Dick lets me live anyway?


SAM
I think you know.


CHARLIE
So I erase the drive first, protect me and you. Then I go back to my old life, right? What?


DEAN
It's not that easy. You're on Dick's radar, which means you don't have an old life anymore.


CHARLIE
I'm gonna die. I should have taken that job at Google.


SAM
Look, Charlie, it's okay if you can't do it. I mean, you didn't volunteer for this.


CHARLIE
Totally. Exactly. But now I volunteer.


SAM
What?


CHARLIE
I got to go back in anyways to wipe Frank's drive. Might as well break into Dick's office, too.


SAM
Are you sure?


CHARLIE
No. But these things are gonna eat everyone I know. What kind of douchebag stands by for that? However, I have never broken into anything in real life before, so... plan?


DEAN
You got a Bluetooth?


CHARLIE
Yeah.


DEAN and SAM join CHARLIE at the table.


DEAN
Security system – can you get into that?


CHARLIE
I can reroute any surveillance cameras we need.


DEAN
All right. Let's start with that.


BOBBY is watching them.


SAM
Do you have a key card to get in the building?


CHARLIE
Uh, yeah. I can't duplicate it, but I can make a fake backing, so that…


EXT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


A black van is parked outside.


VAN – NIGHT


DEAN joins SAM inside the van.


DEAN
How's it going?


SAM
Great, since she set all this up. Um, look.


SAM uses CHARLIE’s laptop, with its Arwen desktop, to show DEAN security footage.


SAM
See this? I can put each camera on a prerecorded loop. Once I do that, she'll have 15 minutes.


DEAN
15 minutes ain't a lot of time.


SAM
No. She said if it took longer to hack his desktop, then she deserved to be eaten.


DEAN
I like her.


The security footage shows CHARLIE standing outside the building.


DEAN
Wait. Is that... Son of a bitch.


SAM
What?


DEAN
Look at her bag.


A close-up of CHARLIE’s bag shows DEAN’s flask in a side pocket.


SAM
Bobby. Wait. Y-you think he, uh –


DEAN
Hitched a ride after we told him to cool his jets? Yeah. What the hell's he thinking?


SAM
He's not. So what do we do – call the whole thing off?


DEAN
We’ve only got one shot at this.


EXT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE is outside the building, looking nervous.


CHARLIE
[singing] I used to think maybe you loved me…


DEAN (V-O)
Charlie, it’s Dean.


The scene alternates between CHARLIE outside the building and DEAN and SAM in the van.


DEAN
Are you singing?


CHARLIE
I sing when I'm nervous. Don't judge me.


DEAN
Judgment-free zone. Listen, uh, check the side pocket in your bag.


CHARLIE
Oh. Thank you. [She takes a drink from the flask.] Mmm. Good idea.


DEAN
Yeah, no problem. Look, that's, uh, kind of a family heirloom. It's a good-luck charm, okay, so don't lose it.


CHARLIE
Copy that. Okay. Let's do this.


CHARLIE doesn’t move.


DEAN
Uh, Charlie? Uh, Charlie?


CHARLIE
I'm having a hard time moving.


DEAN
You can do this.


CHARLIE
Uh, I'm not – I'm not a spy. No, I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't.


SAM takes the phone from DEAN.


SAM
Charlie, hey, it's Sam.


CHARLIE
I'm sorry, Sam. I'm sorry. I-I just –


SAM
It's okay. Uh, listen, w-who's your favorite "Harry Potter" character?


CHARLIE
Uh, Hermione.


SAM
Hermione. Well, uh, all right, did Hermione run when Sirius Black was in trouble or when Voldemort attacked Hogwarts?


DEAN
Seriously?


SAM
Shut up.


CHARLIE
No, of course not.


SAM
What did she do?


CHARLIE
She kicked ass. She actually saves Harry in practically every book. And then she ends up with the wrong –


SAM
Uh, stay on track. Okay, so she kicked ass, right? So, then, what are you gonna do?


CHARLIE
I'm gonna kick it in the ass.


SAM
Good girl.


DEAN
Oh, you go, dumble-dork.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE enters the building and walks past a security guard. Her picture comes up on the security guard’s computer screen. CHARLIE enters the elevator, swipes her pass and hits the button for level 4.


VAN – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN watch the security footage.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE is in the elevator.


VAN – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN watch the security footage.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE gets off at level 4.


VAN – NIGHT


SAM hits a button on the laptop so that the footage of the empty elevator will play on a loop.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


The security guard in the foyer looks at security footage. The shot of the elevator flickers and he taps the screen. CHARLIE gets back into the elevator, takes the strip off her security pass, puts it onto another one pass she is wearing and hits the button for level 11. The security guard sits back, apparently happy with the footage. CHARLIE rides up in the elevator.


CHARLIE
I'm in. I've always wanted to say that.


VAN – NIGHT


DEAN
You're on the clock. Move.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


BOBBY is riding up in the elevator with CHARLIE. CHARLIE gets off on the 11th floor. She flattens herself behind a wall when she sees a SECURITY GUARD.


CHARLIE
Hey, there's a big-ass guard up here, blocking the door. What do I do?


The scene alternates between CHARLIE in the building and DEAN and SAM in the van.


DEAN
Just wait him out.


The SECURITY GUARD sits down and starts reading a magazine.


CHARLIE
He's not going anywhere.


DEAN
Okay, uh, you work there every day. Do you know the guy?


CHARLIE
I guess. I mean, I've seen him. I've never talked to him.


DEAN
Okay, when you've seen him, does he look at you, or does he just kind of slide his eyes by?


CHARLIE
Um... eye contact? I don't know. He always kind of smiles a bit. I don't really –


DEAN
Good. What you're gonna do is you're gonna walk right up to him, and you're gonna flirt your way past.


CHARLIE
I can't. He's not my type.


DEAN
You're gonna have to play through that.


CHARLIE
As in he's not a girl.


DEAN
Oh, oh. Pretend he has boobs.


CHARLIE
Worse.


DEAN
Well, I don't know. Um... Do you have any tattoos? Give him a little sneak peek there. All tattoos are sexy.


CHARLIE
Mine is Princess Leia in a slave bikini straddling a 20-sided die. [DEAN looks at SAM.] I was drunk. It was Comic-Con.


DEAN
We've all been there. Okay, I'm gonna walk you through this.


CHARLIE takes a deep breath and walks into the room with the SECURITY GUARD.


DEAN
Start with a smile.


CHARLIE pastes on a large, fixed smile. The screen briefly splits so that we can see both CHARLIE and DEAN.


DEAN
Relax, Charlie. You just got home, and Scarlett Johansson's waiting for you.


CHARLIE smiles more naturally and makes a pleased sound. The SECURITY GUARD stands up as CHARLIE approaches.


SECURITY GUARD
Can I help you, miss?


CHARLIE
Hey... [She reads his name tag] Bill. [She holds up her I.D. card] Charlie from I.T.


BILL
Oh. Burning the midnight oil, huh?


CHARLIE
Just like you – I mean, when you're not at the gym. What, do you work out with all your free time?


BILL
I try to get to the gym at least three days a week.


The screen splits so that we see BILL, DEAN and CHARLIE.


BILL
Just trying to get back to my fighting weight, you know?


DEAN
It shows. You look amazing. [SAM looks at DEAN.]


CHARLIE
It shows. You look amazing.


DEAN
[to SAM] This never happened. [to CHARLIE] Do you ever do anything else with your free time, like take a girl out for a drink?


CHARLIE
You do anything else with your free time, like [SAM starts to laugh] take a girl out for a drink?


DEAN
Stop laughing, Sammy.


CHARLIE
Stop laughing, Sammy. Um...Y-you don't know that bar – Stop Laughing Sammy? [SAM stifles his laughter with his hand.] That place is bringing sexy back. Which is easy…


DEAN
Stop talking, Charlie!


CHARLIE
… 'cause they kept the receipt. Stop talking, Charlie. Right. So, um, y-you were saying about going out, [CHARLIE plays with her hair] drinks?


BILL
Um... Yeah, yeah. That'd be great.


CHARLIE
Cool. Pencil that in. Hey, can I ask you a favor? The ladies' room downstairs is nasty. Can I use the exec washroom to powder my nose?


BILL
Yeah, yeah. Why not? Um, it's right down the hall. It's the first door on the right.


CHARLIE smiles and winks at BILL. After she walks away, BILL covers his mouth with his hand to check his breath. CHARLIE walks past the ladies’ room.


CHARLIE
I feel dirty.


DEAN
You and me both, sister.


CHARLIE
The eagle is landing. Going radio-silent.


DEAN
Let us know when you're out.


The screen briefly splits so that we can see both DEAN and SAM in the van, and CHARLIE entering DICK ROMAN’s office.


SAM
So, guess we just wait?


DEAN
Yeah.


CHARLIE puts on gloves and sits down at DICK ROMAN’S desk. She plugs in a thumb drive and runs a password generator.


CHARLIE
Your password is "winning" with two 1's? Ew!


The screen briefly splits so we can see both CHARLIE at DICK ROMAN’s desk and BILL looking up from reading a magazine.


The screen returns to full size. CHARLIE starts to copy DICK ROMAN’S files.


BILL looks at his watch, then gets up.


CHARLIE’s file transfer is up to 20%.


VAN – NIGHT


SAM is filling jars with Power Clean. DEAN watches the security footage.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


BILL knocks on the door of the ladies’ room. BOBBY watches.


BOBBY
Okay. Let's Yoda this.


The screen splits so that we can see BILL in the hallway, and CHARLIE in DICK ROMAN’s office. The door to DICK ROMAN’s office closes and locks. BILL and CHARLIE both look towards the sound.


VAN – NIGHT


DEAN watches the security footage.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


BILL tries to open to the door to DICK ROMAN’s office. CHARLIE’s download is up to 65%. BILL uses his key to unlock the door. CHARLIE’s download is up to 70%. The screen splits so that we can see both BILL looking around in DICK ROMAN’s office and DEAN in the van. BILL is about to leave the office when he notices CHARLIE’s bag on DICK ROMAN’s desk. BILL walks to the desk as CHARLIE comes out of an adjoining room wiping her hands on her clothes.


CHARLIE
Hey, you!


BILL
What are you doing in here?


CHARLIE
You said first door on the left, right?


CHARLIE walks over to stand between BILL and DICK ROMAN’s computer.


BILL
No, I said first door on the right.


CHARLIE
Oh! Silly me. I am always forgetting things. Do you know what else I forgot to do?


CHARLIE picks up a pen from the desk. Her file download progress message, which is reflected in the window, reads 93%.


CHARLIE
Give you my phone number.


CHARLIE takes BILL’s hand to write the number on it.


BILL
Uh, we really shouldn't be in here. Mr. Roman doesn't like people in his office.


CHARLIE
I'm sure. Have you seen his bathroom?


CHARLIE puts the pen back on the desk. The file download message now reads 100%. She grabs her thumb drive from the computer.


CHARLIE
Got to go. Call me.


VAN – NIGHT


DEAN
Well, this is awesome.


SAM is still filling jars with Power Clean.


DEAN
You know what? New plan. From now on, we just stay in the van and send in the 90-pound girl.


SAM
Dean, every chomper on earth knows our face. How many do you think are in that building? We wouldn't make it past the lobby.


SAM rolls his chair over close to DEAN.


DEAN
Yeah, I know. Doesn't mean I got to be happy about sending in freaking Veronica Mars.


SAM
She'll be fine... or we'll go in.


DEAN
And get as far as we can. Damn right.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE plugs the thumb drive into her computer and takes another drink from the flask. She starts to transfer the contents of the thumb drive to a WiFi I.P. address.


VAN – NIGHT


CHARLIE (V-O)
Hey, guys.


DEAN
Hey.


The scene alternates between CHARLIE at her desk and DEAN and SAM in the van.


CHARLIE
Sending you all the flagged dig files now.


SAM
Charlie, you are a genius!


CHARLIE
I know. It's a problem.


A door opens and PETE enters.


CHARLIE
Damn it. Hey, Pete! Guess we're both on deadline, huh?


PETE
How's it going?


CHARLIE
Good, good. I'll give you a full progress report in a few hours.


PETE
Great. Hit that deadline, right? [He reaches out to squeeze CHARLIE’s arm.] Well, holler if you need anything.


CHARLIE
Hey, guys, you still there?


DEAN
Yeah. What the hell was that?


CHARLIE
Oh, just my manager, the monster.


DEAN
Leave.


CHARLIE
I can't. I got to act normal. I told him I was working. Let's just finish this.


CHARLIE opens a number of DICK ROMAN’s emails concerning a package leaving Iran and the suspension of the digs.


CHARLIE
Are you seeing this?


SAM
It looks like Dick stopped digging days ago.


CHARLIE
Why?


DEAN
Guess he found what he was looking for. Can you check?


CHARLIE
Way ahead of you. Looking at travel reports, expenses... Here we go. Something in his suitcase left Iran last week. Spent the last 72 hours in armored cars and private planes. Whatever it is, it's coming here for Dick tonight. So, w-what the hell is it?


DEAN
I don't know. Whatever it is, he wants it bad, which means we got to grab it, end of story.


CHARLIE
Well, it's landing at a private airport near here – crap – right about now. A courier's set to pick it up.


DEAN
What's the exact landing time?


CHARLIE
42 minutes. Can you make it?


SAM looks at Richard Roman Enterprises and Downey Airport on an online map.


DEAN
We can try. Uh, all right, Charlie, one more favor, and then get the hell out of there.


CUT TO: DICK ROMAN talking on his cell phone.


DICK ROMAN
Outstanding. And you'll call as soon as the package is in hand?


EXT. AIRPORT – NIGHT


A LEVIATHAN is waiting outside the cargo depot.


LEVIATHAN
Absolutely. I'm here waiting. In fact, I've got time for a light snack.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE removes the thumb drive from her computer. She gets up to leave, then gasps: DICK ROMAN is standing right in front of her.


DICK ROMAN
Hey, Charlie. I was hoping I'd find you here.



ACT THREE
EXT. NIGHT


An airplane is in the sky.


EXT. AIRPORT – NIGHT


The plane lands. A suitcase slides along the ground and one of the pilots picks it up. A BAGGAGE HANDLER pulling a cart full of suitcases almost runs into the LEVIATHAN, who is standing near the plane.


LEVIATHAN
Hey.


BAGGAGE HANDLER
Sorry.


LEVIATHAN
Watch it.


The BAGGAGE HANDLER puts a blue case on the ground. The LEVIATHAN points to it and looks at the pilots, then nods and picks up the case. He shakes hands with the pilots.


CUT TO: the LEVIATHAN leaves the airport building and gets into a waiting black vehicle, which then drives away. SAM and DEAN are standing next to the open trunk of their car.


SAM
So now what?


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


The LEVIATHAN carries the case into DICK ROMAN’s office.


DICK ROMAN
I've been looking for this for a very, very long time.


The LEVIATHAN opens the case. Inside is a bottle of Power Clean, hooked up to a bomb.


DICK ROMAN
Now, who could have done that?


The bomb ticks and goes off.


CUT TO: CHARLIE at her desk. The scene alternates between CHARLIE at her desk and DEAN and SAM in the van.


CHARLIE
A courier's set to pick it up.


DEAN
What's the exact landing time?


CHARLIE
42 minutes. Can you make it?


DEAN
We can try. Uh, all right, Charlie, one more favor, and then get the hell out of there.


CHARLIE
What do you need?


DEAN
More time.


CHARLIE
Then let's get you some.


CHARLIE types an email to DICK ROMAN from the travel department.


CHARLIE
Travel department's e-mailing Dick. Suitcase still en route, but diverted by weather and will be 30 minutes late. [She stands up and looks around the office.] I'll finish mopping you guys off the drive and get the hell out of Dodge.


DEAN
Call us when you're clear.


CHARLIE
Text you from the border, bro.



EXT. AIRPORT – NIGHT


A suitcase slides along the ground and one of the pilots picks it up. A BAGGAGE HANDLER pulling a cart full of suitcases almost runs into the LEVIATHAN, who is standing near the plane.


LEVIATHAN
Hey.


BAGGAGE HANDLER
Sorry.


LEVIATHAN
Watch it.


The BAGGAGE HANDLER puts a blue case on the ground. This time we see a close-up of his face: it is SAM.


The scene repeats again:


LEVIATHAN
Hey.


SAM, crouching down and hiding his face, takes a gray case from the plane.


LEVIATHAN
Watch it.


SAM takes a blue case from the baggage cart and puts it on the ground, and puts the gray case on the baggage cart.


The LEVIATHAN picks up the blue case. SAM takes the gray case off the baggage cart and walks away with it. He is joined by DEAN.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE removes the thumb drive from her computer. She gets up to leave, then gasps: DICK ROMAN is standing behind her desk.


DICK ROMAN
Hey, Charlie. I was hoping I'd find you here.


CHARLIE
Um, hey, Mr. Roman.


DICK ROMAN
Please. Dick.


PETE walks up.


DICK ROMAN
Pete, we're good here. Why don't you go grab a bite?


PETE leaves.


DICK ROMAN
Show me what you found.


EXT. AIRPORT – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN are standing next to the open trunk of their car.


SAM
So now what?


DEAN
See what we've won.


DEAN opens the gray case. Inside is something wrapped in cloth, which DEAN uncovers.


SAM
Did we just... steal a – a hunk of red clay?


DEAN
That's a good question. Why don't we answer that a few thousand miles away from here, though? Now where is Charlie?


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE’s phone rings. She looks at it, but doesn’t answer. DICK ROMAN is standing over her as she sits at her desk.


DICK ROMAN
So there's nothing about my company?


CHARLIE shakes her head.


DICK ROMAN
Ah. How about a Sam or a Dean?


CHARLIE
I'm sorry, who?


DICK ROMAN
Sam and Dean Winchester. Give it a little peek, would you?


CHARLIE searches for “SAM + DEAN + WINCHESTER”. BOBBY is standing behind DICK ROMAN.


BOBBY
Dick Roman. Come on. The girl's right there. Worry about her.


DICK ROMAN
Is it me, or did it just drop 10 degrees in here?


CHARLIE
It's a bit nippy, yeah.


DICK ROMAN
I'll have maintenance check the A.C. I can't have you cold, now, can I?


BOBBY
You miserable... Damn it, Bobby, come on.


“NO RESULTS FOUND” flashes up on CHARLIE’s screen.


CHARLIE
Nothing about those Winchesters.


DICK ROMAN
If items were deleted from the drive, would you be able to tell?


CHARLIE
Not if they were deleted properly.


DICK ROMAN
Well, they're crafty. Have all the data sent to me.


CHARLIE
Of course.


DICK ROMAN
So, really, how did you do it?


CHARLIE
Uh, do what?


DICK ROMAN
You broke the unbreakable. What's the thought process? Walk me through it, and ix-nay the jargon.


CHARLIE
Um... nothing's unbreakable, really. Nothing's safe if you poke at it long enough.


DICK ROMAN
Nothing's safe. I like that. But that isn't what I'm asking, Charlie. Your spark – it's one in a million. Believe me, but when you got it, you invent guns and iPads and viruses, and, holy crap, you can be crafty. What is that, Charlie?


CHARLIE
Um –


DICK ROMAN
'Cause I can feed every fact in your brain to someone else, they still wouldn't be able to be you.


CHARLIE
I guess you can't clone me.


DICK ROMAN
Don't think that doesn't piss me off.


DICK ROMAN’s phone rings and he answers it.


DICK ROMAN
Yes. Fantastic. Bring it up to my office. I'll be right there. [He hangs up.] I think we're on to something here. Stay here, will you? I'll be back in two shakes.


CHARLIE grabs her bag and hurries down the stairs.


CUT TO: The LEVIATHAN carrying the case into DICK ROMAN’s office.


CUT TO: CHARLIE hurrying down the stairs.


CUT TO: The LEVIATHAN opening the case. Inside is a bottle of Power Clean, hooked up to a bomb. The bomb ticks and goes off.


CUT TO: CHARLIE sprinting for the door to the building.


CUT TO: The LEVIATHAN lying on the floor with a burned face. DICK ROMAN takes out a handkerchief and uses it to pick up the receiver of the telephone on the desk. His face is also burned.


DICK ROMAN
Nothing is safe, apparently. Lock the building down now!


ACT FOUR
INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


CHARLIE is sprinting for the doors. She reaches them to find them locked. DICK ROMAN, whose face has healed, is riding down in the elevator. BOBBY puts his hands against the doors. DICK ROMAN and PETE continue down in the elevator. The glass of the doors shatters around BOBBY’s hands, but stays in place. DICK ROMAN and PETE reach the ground floor. PETE heads for CHARLIE.


PETE
Hold on there, Charlie.


BOBBY shoves PETE, who crashes into CHARLIE, knocking her into a pillar and then onto the ground. BOBBY pushes DICK ROMAN into a cabinet. CHARLIE lies on the floor holding her arm and groaning. SAM and DEAN crash through the glass doors. The security guard from the foyer approaches.


CHARLIE
Dean, he's one of them!


DEAN tosses borax onto PETE. PETE yells and brown smoke rises from his face. SAM punches the security guard. PETE continues to sizzle and scream. SAM picks up CHARLIE.


DICK ROMAN
That would explain it. You're hanging with the wrong crowd, kiddo.


DICK ROMAN starts forward as SAM and DEAN move towards the door. BOBBY appears in front of DICK ROMAN.


BOBBY
Not so fast, Dick.


BOBBY shoves DICK ROMAN hard. DICK ROMAN flies through the air into a large display picture of the Richard Roman Enterprises building and falls to the ground. DEAN and SAM watch as BOBBY flickers, then reappears and looks back at them before disappearing again. DICK ROMAN growls and sits up.


DICK ROMAN
All right, enough! Show yourself. Let's do this like real monsters.


DICK ROMAN tries to get up, but is shoved back down.


DICK ROMAN
Ha, ha, ha! You got to do that again. That tickled.


SAM
Dean, come on. Come on!


SAM, carrying CHARLIE, and DEAN leave the building. DICK ROMAN stands up.


CAR – NIGHT


DEAN is driving, SAM is in the passenger seat and CHARLIE is in the back seat.


DEAN
Charlie, talk to us. You okay?


CHARLIE
No. Why didn't you kill him?


SAM
'Cause we can't yet. But we will.


CHARLIE
The really evil ones always need a special sword. Oh, okay. I'm gonna pass out now.


BOBBY is now also visible in the back seat.


INT. RICHARD ROMAN ENTERPRISES – NIGHT


DICK ROMAN walks into his office, talking angrily on his cell phone. The LEVIATHAN who picked up the case is getting to his feet.


DICK ROMAN
Because they have it! Now get it back, before they figure the damn thing out!


DICK ROMAN tosses his phone down. The LEVIATHAN’s face is now healed.


LEVIATHAN
Please, sir, d-don't bib me.


DICK ROMAN
Bib you?! Why would I waste a perfectly good meal?


DICK ROMAN puts his hands on the LEVIATHAN’s shoulders. His face transforms and he lunges at the LEVIATHAN’s head.



ACT FIVE
EXT. BUS TERMINAL – DAY


A man entering the terminal holds the door open for CHARLIE, DEAN and SAM, who are coming out. CHARLIE’s arm is in a sling.


CHARLIE
Thank you.


DEAN
Thanks.


CHARLIE
I left your dumb flask on the back seat, by the way. Worst good-luck charm ever.


DEAN hands CHARLIE her bag.


DEAN
Here you go.


CHARLIE
Thanks.


SAM
So listen, um, we can't thank you enough.


CHARLIE
Actually, you can. Never contact me again, like, ever. Deal?


CHARLIE holds out her hand and SAM shakes it.


SAM
Deal.


CHARLIE shakes hands with DEAN.


DEAN
Keep your head down out there, okay?


CHARLIE
This ain't the first time I've disappeared. You think my name is really Charlie Bradbury? Please. So, good luck saving the world. [She raises a hand in a Vulcan salute.] Peace out, bitches.


CHARLIE hands her bag to the bus driver to stow.


CHARLIE
Thanks a lot.


DEAN
She's kind of like the little sister I never wanted.


SAM
We got to talk.


They start to walk.


DEAN
What, you mean before we get back to the car and the flask?


SAM
Exactly. So, what the hell happened back in the lobby, Dean?


DEAN
Man, if I had a free shot, I'd have bitch-slapped the hell out of Dick.


SAM
Yeah, but, I mean [He stops and turns to face DEAN], Charlie got her freaking arm broken.


DEAN
He didn't mean to do it.


SAM
Exactly. He's not in control, not about Dick. That was vengeful-spirit crap.


DEAN
I know. But it's still Bobby.


SAM
But if he really goes there, he won't be anymore, and then we won't be able to pull him back. And then what are we supposed to do?


DEAN
I know. Look, let's just figure out what that thing we stole is, and then we'll figure out what the hell to do with Bobby.


DEAN raises his eyebrows at SAM, then walks off. After a moment, SAM follows him.
