NOW
DAY, MONUMENT, COLORADO.

SAM rushes into a bedroom. DEAN follows and shuts the door. They search the room. DEAN checks the drawers, while SAM checks the safe.

DEAN: Any sign of it?

SAM: Nothing. Are you sure this is Bela’s room?

DEAN: (Holds up two wigs and shows them to SAM) I’d say so.

Suddenly the phone rings and they share a look. DEAN walks to the phone and looks at SAM who shakes his head. DEAN picks up the phone and answers it cautiously. It’s BELA, who is calling from her car.

BELA: Dean? Sweetie, are you there?

DEAN: Where are you?

BELA: Two states away by now.

DEAN: Where?

BELA: Where’s our usual quippy banter? I miss it.

DEAN: I want it back, Bela… now.

BELA: Your little pistol, you mean? (Looks at the Colt on the seat next to her) Sorry, I can’t at the moment.

DEAN: You understand how many people are gonna die if you do this?

BELA: What exactly is it that you think I plan to do with it?

DEAN: Take the only weapon we have against an army of demons and sell it to the highest bidder.

BELA: You know nothing about me.

DEAN: I know I’m gonna stop you.

BELA: Tough words for a guy who can’t even find me.

DEAN: Oh, I’ll find you, sweetheart. You know why? Because I have absolutely nothing better to do than to track you down.

BELA: That’s where you’re wrong. You’re about to be quite occupied. (DEAN looks at SAM) Did you really think I wouldn’t take precautions?

Suddenly police officers burst into BELA’s room and point guns at SAM and DEAN. They both raise their hands above their heads.

POLICE OFFICER 1: Hands in the air!

POLICE OFFICER 2: Down on your knees.

BELA hangs up the phone and sighs in relief.

DEAN: That bitch!

POLICE OFFICER 1: Turn around! Now!

The POLICE OFFICERS force DEAN and SAM to lie down on the floor.

POLICE OFFICER 1: Sam and Dean Winchester, you have the right to remain silent.

SAM and DEAN see feet come closer. They look at each other, then up.

POLICE OFFICER 1: Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney and have an attorney present during any questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you at government expense.

DEAN and SAM look up to see Agent HENRIKSEN.

HENRIKSEN: Hi guys… It’s been a while.

DEAN and SAM look at each other. DEAN closes his eyes and lays his head down on the floor.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
DAY: POLICE STATION. HENRIKSEN talks to the police.

MELVIN: So did you get them?

HENRIKSEN: Where is everyone? I asked for all your men.

MELVIN: And you got them. They want with you on the raid.

HENRIKSEN: Four men? That’s all?

MELVIN: Everyone I could drum up with an hour’s notice. We’re a small town, Agent Henriksen.

HENRIKSEN walks towards the holding cells. He sees a man sleeping in the first one.

HENRIKSEN: What’s he in for?

PHIL: Drunk and disorderly.

HENRIKSEN: Keys. (PHIL and MELVIN look at HENRIKSEN in disbelief) Now.

PHIL reaches for the key in his pocket and gives it to HENRIKSEN.

MELVIN: What are you doing?

HENRIKSEN: (Opens the cell and taps the sleeping man on the back) It is your lucky night, sir. You are free to go.

MELVIN: What the hell are you doing?

HENRIKSEN: (Lifts up the man) This way. (Takes the man out of the cell and gives him to PHIL)

MELVIN: Agent Henriksen, you can’t just release my prisoners. (HENRIKSEN walks away) Agent Henriksen.

HENRIKSEN: Look, I get it… you’re Mayberry P.D.

MELVIN: Excuse me?

HENRIKSEN: And this isn’t how I’d do it if I had my choice. But a tip’s a tip and we had to move fast. (Walks back to the office)

MELVIN: Look, Agent, this ain’t my first rodeo.

HENRIKSEN: You’ve never been to a rodeo like this before. You have any idea who we’re about to bring in here?

MELVIN: Yeah, a couple of fugitives.

HENRIKSEN: The most dangerous criminals you’ve ever laid your eyeballs on. Think Hannibal Lecter and his half-wit little brother. Do you know what these guys do for kicks? Dig up graves and mutilate corpses. They’re not just killers, Sheriff. They’re Satan-worshipping, nutbag killers.

NANCY, the secretary, is silently listening to HENRIKSEN and she holds the cross pendant she wears around her neck.

HENRIKSEN: So work with me here. I’ll get them out your hair and on their way to Supermax and you’ll be home in enough time to watch the farm report.

MELVIN: (Nods) However we can help.

HENRIKSEN: (Comes closer) Those men of yours… post them at the exits.

MELVIN: Yes sir.

HENRIKSEN: (Talks into his walkie) Reidy?

REIDY (V.O.): Yeah, Vic?

HENRIKSEN: Bring them in. (NANCY looks at HENRIKSEN) I guess we’re ready as we’re gonna be.

Doors open. SAM and DEAN are led in, shackled together by a chain and guarded by two officers.

DEAN: Why all the sourpusses? (Smiles)

SAM looks at the name plate on NANCY's desk, which reads "NANCY FITZGERALD, Secretary". NANCY looks afraid and grabs her rosary.

REIDY: I’ll show you to the cells.

REIDY grabs DEAN's arm.

DEAN: Hey! Hey! Watch the merchandise!

NANCY’s eyes follow them, scared.

DEAN: We’re not the ones you should be scared of, Nancy.

NANCY looks at her rosary and holds it.

PRISON CELL: DEAN and SAM are brought to their cell. The police leave them alone. DEAN heads for the bed and SAM to the door. They both almost fall because of the chain.

SAM: Dean, come on!

DEAN: All right, all right. Sit?

SAM: Yeah.

They awkwardly walk around each other and end up sitting on the bed.

DEAN: How we gonna Houdini out of this one?

SAM: Good question.

IN THE OFFICE: HENRIKSEN makes a phone call and loosens his bullet-proof vest.

HENRIKSEN: It’s me. Steven in? (Pause) Well get him out of the meeting. (HENRIKSEN looks at MELVIN who watches him)

FBI OFFICE: Wanted posters for DEAN and SAM are hanging in the wall.

STEVEN: Groves.

HENRIKSEN V.O.: I’ve got them.

STEVEN: Well, I’ll be damned. (He opens his Winchester case file) I was betting on your headstone reading “Couldn’t catch the Winchester boys.”

HENRIKSEN: Well, they’ll be at Supermax by morning.

STEVEN: How?

HENRIKSEN V.O.: Armored bus, loaded with men.

STEVEN: A bus? What, are you trying to give me another ulcer?

HENRIKSEN: Look, we’re taking every precaution.

STEVEN V.O.: Screw that. I’m sending a chopper.

STEVEN: Like the last time? And the time before that?

HENRIKSEN: Whatever you think is best.

STEVEN: Damn right, and I’ll be on it. I can’t take you losing those boys again. They have been a primary thorn in my ass for months. So Victor…

HENRIKSEN V.O.: Yeah?

STEVEN: Glue your eyeballs to them till I get there.

HENRIKSEN: (hangs up the phone and addresses MELVIN) There’s a chopper on its way.

MELVIN: But we don’t have a helicopter pad.

HENRIKSEN: Then clear the damn parking lot.

CELL: DEAN looks at HENRIKSEN. SAM glances at HENRIKSEN, then away.

HENRIKSEN: You know what I’m trying to decide?

DEAN: I don’t know. What? Whether Cialis will help you with your little condition?

HENRIKSEN: What to have for dinner tonight. (SAM looks at him) Steak or lobster, what the hell, surf and turf. (DEAN smirks cynically) I got a lot to celebrate. I mean, after all, seeing you two in chains…

DEAN: You kinky son of a bitch. We don’t swing that way.

HENRIKSEN: Now, that’s funny.

DEAN: You know, I wouldn’t bust out the melted butter just yet. Couldn’t catch us at the bank, couldn’t keep us in that jail.

HENRIKSEN: You’re right. Screwed up. I underestimated you. I didn’t count on you being that smart but now I’m ready.

DEAN: Yeah, ready to lose us again?

HENRIKSEN: Ready like a court order to keep you in a Supermaximum prison in Nevada till trial. Ready like isolation in a soundproof, windowless cell, so that between you and me… probably unconstitutional.

SAM and DEAN realize HENRIKSEN is serious.

HENRIKSEN: How’s that for ready?

DEAN doesn’t say anything.

HENRIKSEN: Take a good look at Sam – you two will never see each other again.

SAM and DEAN look at HENRIKSEN, disconcerted.

HENRIKSEN: Aw. Where’s that smug smile, Dean? I want to see it.

DEAN: (Shakes his head, disbelief) You got the wrong guys.

HENRIKSEN: Oh, yeah. I forgot. You fight monsters. Sorry, Dean. Truth is, your daddy brainwashed you with all that devil talk and no doubt touched you in a bad place. That’s all. That’s reality.

DEAN: Why don’t you shut your mouth?

HENRIKSEN: Well, guess what. Life sucks. Get a helmet. ‘Cause everybody’s got a sob story. But not everybody becomes a killer.

The sound of a helicopter approaching is heard.

HENRIKSEN: And now I have two less to worry about.

HENRIKSEN looks at his watch and smiles.

HENRIKSEN: Mm. (tapping his watch) It’s surf and turf time. (Laughs)

SAM and DEAN watch HENRIKSEN leave. They both look stressed.

OFFICE: Agent STEVEN GROVES comes inside the office and HENRIKSEN holds out his hand.

HENRIKSEN: Steven!

STEVEN: Gentlemen. (Instead of shaking HENRIKSEN's hand, he hands HENRIKSEN some files)

HENRIKSEN: (Confused) What’s all this?

STEVEN: What can I say? The FBI didn’t invent bureaucracy; we perfected it.

HENRIKSEN: You want me to do all this now?

STEVEN: (smiles) Sorry. Now, Victor.

NANCY smiles.

STEVEN: I’m gonna go take a good long gander at our fugitives.

STEVEN leaves HENRIKSEN to finish the paperwork. REIDY gives HENRIKSEN a pen and HENRIKSEN starts to fill out the forms, annoyed.


CELLS
STEVEN enters the holding cell area and closes the main door to the office area. DEAN stands up and looks at STEVEN.

STEVEN: Sam and Dean Winchester. I’m Deputy Director Steven Groves. This is a pleasure.

DEAN: Well, glad one of us feels that way.

STEVEN: I’ve been waiting a long time for you two to come out of the woodwork.

Suddenly STEVEN points his gun and shoots DEAN in his left shoulder. DEAN’s blood sprays to the wall. DEAN grunts and falls back, while SAM jumps up and grapples with STEVEN through the bars. DEAN falls on the bed as STEVEN fires several more shots, narrowly missing DEAN. SAM has a grip on STEVEN, holding his gun arm. STEVEN’s eyes turn black and SAM begins an exorcism in Latin, which causes STEVEN's head to whip from side to side.

STEVEN: Sorry, I've gotta cut this short. It’s gonna be a long night, fellas.

DEAN sits up, clutching his shoulder, as the demon leaves STEVEN's body, screaming, and the black smoke disappears into the ceiling air vent.

OFFICE: HENRIKSEN and REIDY hear STEVEN’s scream.

REIDY: What the hell was that?

Both of them run to the cells.

CELLS: STEVEN falls to the ground. PHIL and MELVIN enter, followed by HENRIKSEN, who points his gun at SAM.

MELVIN: All right, put the gun down!

SAM: Wait. Okay. Wait.

MELVIN: He shot him!

SAM: I didn’t shoot him, okay. I didn’t shoot anyone.

DEAN: He shot me!

HENRIKSEN: Get on your knees, NOW!

SAM: Okay, okay, okay. Don’t shoot. Please. Look. Here. Here. (SAM passes the gun through the bars) Look. We didn’t shoot him. Check the body. There’s no blood. We did not kill him. Go ahead, check him.

REIDY checks STEVEN’s body.

REIDY: Vic, there’s no bullet wound.

DEAN: He’s probably been dead for months.

HENRIKSEN: What did you do to him?

DEAN: We didn’t do anything.

HENRIKSEN: Talk or I shoot.

DEAN: You won’t believe us.

SAM: He was possessed.

HENRIKSEN: Possessed? Right. Fire up the chopper! We’re taking them out of here now.

DEAN: Yeah! Do that!

REIDY: Bill? (static on the other end of the walkie-talkie) Bill, are you there?

There’s no answer from the walkie. HENRIKSEN nods to REIDY to check outside. MELVIN and PHIL continue to point their guns at SAM and DEAN.

NIGHT: OUTSIDE, REIDY discovers two officers whose throats have been cut. He walks to the chopper. The pilot and two more officers are dead.

REIDY: (into walkie) They’re dead. I think they’re all dead.

Suddenly there’s a blast of light. REIDY yells and is flung backwards.

INSIDE: CELL.

HENRIKSEN: What the hell was that? Reidy? Reidy?!

OUTSIDE: The chopper is on fire. REIDY coughs and sits up. HENRIKSEN’s voice is heard from the walkie talkie.

HENRIKSEN V.O.: What the hell was that? Come in? Reidy? Reidy?

REIDY walks toward the burned chopper. He turns to find one of the dead officers on his feet and looking at him with black eyes. The possessed officer crushes REIDY's flesh. REIDY screams.

ACT TWO
OFFICE: MELVIN fills his rifle with bullets while NANCY tries to make a call.

NANCY: Hello? (NANCY keeps trying to get a line.)

MELVIN: My men? Agent Henriksen— (HENRIKSEN doesn’t answer.)

PHIL: What the hell’s happening out there?

NANCY: I can’t get a line. All the phones are out.

MELVIN: Henriksen! Four of my men!

NANCY: The Internet, my cell…. It’s all dead. How can it all be dead?

MELVIN tosses the rifle to PHIL. Suddenly the lights go out.

CELL: SAM and DEAN stand up.

DEAN: Oh, that can’t be good.

BACK TO OFFICE:

NANCY: Oh my God.

MELVIN: No, it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay. We’re gonna go, we’re gonna go… right now. (He loads his gun. HENRIKSEN turns around.)

HENRIKSEN: Nobody’s going anywhere. Everybody calm down.

MELVIN: Your partner is out there! My men are out there!

HENRIKSEN: I know. We go out there, we’re asking to die too. Don’t you get it?

MELVIN: Get what?

HENRIKSEN: They’re out there and they’re coming in here. This is a siege. So this might be a good time for you to lock the doors and the windows (NANCY looks up, panicking), take a breath, and maybe deal with this like trained professionals with some sense in their heads.

PHIL and MELVIN look at each other and calm down. MELVIN nods and leaves. HENRIKSEN walks to NANCY.

HENRIKSEN: You okay?

NACNY nods but then shakes her head.

HENRIKSEN: I wouldn’t think so. Nancy, right? I’m gonna get you through this. You got my word. You got that?

NANCY smiles tearfully and nods.

CUT to CELL: SAM helps DEAN with his wound, while DEAN grunts.

SAM: All right, don’t be such a wuss.

HENRIKSEN: What’s the plan? Kill everyone in the station, bust you two out?

DEAN: What the hell are you talking about?

HENRIKSEN: I’m talking about your psycho friends. I’m talking about a blood bath.

DEAN: Okay, I promise you – whoever’s out there? is not here to help us.

SAM: Look, you got to believe us. Everyone here is in terrible danger.

HENRIKSEN: You think?

DEAN: Why don’t you let us out of here so we can save your asses?

HENRIKSEN: From what? (pause, while Sam and Dean look away) You gonna say “demons”? (Raises his gun, pointed at the ceiling, for emphasis) Don’t you dare say “demons”. Let me tell you something. You should be a lot more scared of me. (He leaves.)

SAM: How’s the shoulder?

DEAN: (Takes away a pad of toilet paper with a large blood stain on it) It’s awesome. (Tosses away the pad) I’ll live. You know, if we get out of here alive. So you got a plan?

SAM checks DEAN’s exit wound on the back of his shoulder as DEAN grimaces in pain. DEAN realizes that NANCY is peeking around a corner outside the bars.

DEAN: (quietly to SAM) Hey.

SAM: Hey…

NANCY backs off, scared.

SAM: Hey, uh, please. Please. We need your help. It’s… it’s Nancy. Nancy, right? (NANCY just looks at SAM) Nancy, my… my brother’s been shot. He’s… He’s bleeding really bad. You think maybe you could get us a towel? Please? Just one clean towel? (NANCY’s not sure and still a bit afraid) Look. Look at us. We’re not the bad guys. I swear.

DEAN gives NANCY a smile and she leaves them. SAM sighs.

DEAN: Nice try.

SAM sighs again, then turns around and sees that NANCY has come back with a clean towel.

SAM: Thank you.

NANCY comes closer to the boys, carefully.

SAM: It's okay. (He holds out his handcuffed hands)

NANCY puts the towel inside the bars while SAM smiles at her. She smiles back. Suddenly SAM grabs NANCY’s arm and drags her against the bars. NANCY screams. PHIL runs in with his rifle.

PHIL: Let her go! Let her go!

SAM lets Nancy go. She backs away, scared.

PHIL: (Point the gun at SAM) You’re okay, Nance? (Looks at SAM) Try something again, get shot. And not in the arm.

SAM: Okay.

PHIL and NANCY walk away. After they leave, DEAN hits SAM in the arm.

DEAN: What the hell was that?

SAM holds up NANCY’s rosary. DEAN chuckles softly.


LATER
DEAN is pressing the towel to his wound, sitting on the bed next to SAM.

SAM: We’re like sitting ducks in here.

DEAN: Yeah, I know. Would it kill these cops to BRING US A SNACK?! (He shouts the last words)

SAM: How many you figure are out there?

DEAN: I don’t know.

SAM: However many they are, they could be possessing anyone. Anyone could just walk right in.

DEAN: It's kind of wild, right? I mean it’s like they’re coming for us. They’ve never done that before. (DEAN smiles) It’s like we got a contract on us. Think it’s because we’re so awesome? I think it’s ‘cause we’re so awesome. (He smiles again, but stops smiling after SAM looks at him, unamused)

MELVIN comes in and unlocks their cell.

DEAN: Well, howdy, there, sheriff.

DEAN and SAM stand up while MELVIN opens the cell door.

SAM: Uh, sheriff?

MELVIN: It’s time to go, boys.

DEAN and SAM step back as MELVIN comes into the cell.

DEAN: Uh… you know what? We’re – we're just comfy right here. But thank you.

HENRIKSEN appears at the door of the cell.

HENRIKSEN: What do you think you’re doing?

MELVIN: We’re not just gonna sit around here and wait to die. We’re gonna make a run for it.

HENRIKSEN: It’s safer here.

MELVIN: There’s a SWAT facility in Boulder.

HENRIKSEN: (Comes inside the cell) We’re not going anywhere.

MELVIN: The hell we’re not.

HENRIKSEN shots MELVIN in the head. DEAN and SAM grapple with HENRIKSEN and SAM pushes HENRIKSEN’s head into the toilet and begins an exorcism. PHIL runs around the corner with his rifle. DEAN points HENRIKSEN’s gun at him.

DEAN: Stay back!

HENRIKSEN lifts his head up out of the water. His face is burning and he yells. SAM shoves him back into the toilet bowl, in which NANCY’s rosary is floating. SAM continues the exorcism. NANCY comes around the corner.

DEAN: (to SAM) Hurry up!

HENRIKSEN lifts his head again. His eyes are black.

HENRIKSEN: It’s too late. I already called them. They’re already coming.

SAM shoves him back into the water and finishes the exorcism. HENRIKSEN screams as black smoke shoots out of his mouth and up to the air vent in the ceiling.

HENRIKSEN falls to the floor as SAM breathes heavily.

NANCY: Is he… is he dead?

HENRIKSEN regains consciousness and coughs.

SAM: Henriksen! Hey. Is that you in there?

HENRIKSEN gets up and sits on the bed.

HENRIKSEN: I… I shot the sheriff.

DEAN: (smiles after a pause) But you didn't shoot the deputy.

SAM glares at DEAN in disbelief.

HENRIKSEN: Five minutes ago, I was fine, and then…

DEAN: Let me guess. Some nasty black smoke jammed itself down your throat?

SAM: You were possessed.

HENRIKSEN: Possessed, like… possessed?

SAM: That’s what it feels like. Now you know.

DEAN: I owe the biggest “I told you so” ever. (He gives HENRIKSEN back his gun.)

HENRIKSEN: Officer Amici. (Stands up and addresses PHIL) Keys...

PHIL gives HENRIKSEN the keys. SAM and DEAN’s chains fall to the floor.

HENRIKSSEN: All right, so how do we survive?

NIGHT – OFFICE: SAM draws a devil’s trap on the floor with spray paint. DEAN looks at the floor plans to the police station, on which two devil’s traps are drawn, while NANCY takes care of his wound. PHIL and HENRIKSEN prepare guns.

DEAN: Well, that’s nice. It’s not gonna do much good.

PHIL: We got an arsenal here.

DEAN: You don’t poke a bear with BB gun. That’s just gonna make them mad.

HENRIKSEN: What do you need?

DEAN: Salt. Lots and lots of salt.

PHIL: Salt?

DEAN: What, is there an echo in here?

NANCY: There’s road salt in the storeroom.

DEAN: Perfect. Perfect. We need salt at every window and every door.

HENRIKSEN and PHIL leave.

DEAN: How you holdin’ up, Nancy?

NANCY: Okay. (pause) When I was little, I would come home from the church and start to talk about the devil. And my parents would tell me to stop being so literal. I guess I showed them, huh? (Adds a last piece of tape to DEAN’s bandage) That should hold.

DEAN: Thank you.

NANCY: Sure.

PHIL comes in with bags of salt.

DEAN: Hey, where's my car?

PHIL: Impound lot out back.

DEAN: Okay.

PHIL: Wait. (DEAN looks at him) You’re not going out there?

DEAN: Yeah, I got to get something out of my trunk.

NIGHT – IMPOUND LOT
DEAN opens the gate to the impound lot, then the trunk of the Impala. He starts putting things into a bag. The lights at a gas station flicker and thick black smoke interspersed with blue lightening races past. The lights in the impound lot flicker and crackle. DEAN grabs some dreamcatcher-like amulets and turns to see the black smoke and blue and pink light coming towards him. He runs back inside as the smoke comes closer.

ACT THREE
INSIDE POLICE STATION: SAM is drawing a devil’s trap on the floor with spray paint while the others line the windows with salt. DEAN rushes inside.

DEAN: They’re coming! Hurry.

Black smoke hits the window that NANCY is at, and she screams. NANCY, SAM and DEAN run to the main office area, where HENRIKSEN is. DEAN tosses a gun to SAM. From the outside, we can see the demon smoke hit the building. From the inside of the building, we see the smoke surround the windows. The lights in the main room flicker and it becomes darker. From the outside, we see the smoke engulfing the building. NANCY clutches the cross she wears around her neck. Dust rains down from the ceiling as the building shakes. Then the smoke seems to disappear and it becomes quiet again.

SAM: Everybody okay?

HENRIKSEN: Define “okay”.

DEAN: All right, everybody needs to put these on. (Gives each of them a protection necklace) They’ll keep you from being possessed. There you go.

NANCY: What about you and Sam?

DEAN and SAM show their matching protection symbol tattoos on their chests.

HENRIKSEN: Smart. How long you had those?

SAM: Not long enough.

CUT TO: HENRIKSEN looks at MELVIN’s name plate, while DEAN watches him. NANCY is organizing some files when she sees a crowd of people outside.

NANCY: Hey, that’s Jenna Rubner.

We see a close-up of a woman with long red hair and black eyes.

SAM: That’s not Jenna anymore.

NANCY: That’s where all that black demon smoke went?

SAM: Looks like.

CUT TO: PHIL is in another room. He grabs a chair and stands on it to look out a window, which he wipes with his hand. When he leaves, we see that the salt line is broken.

BACK TO: MAIN OFFICE.

HENRIKSEN: Shotgun shells full of salt.

DEAN: (Filling his shotgun) Whatever works.

HENRIKSEN: Fighting off monsters with condiments. (He takes off his tie) So. Turns out demons are real. (He starts filling his rifle with salt shells)

DEAN: FYI, ghosts are real too. So are werewolves, vampires, changelings, evil clowns that eat people.

HENRIKSEN: Okay then.

DEAN: If it makes you feel better, Bigfoot’s a hoax. (He smiles)

HENRIKSEN: It doesn’t. How many demons?

DEAN: Total? No clue. A lot.

HENRIKSEN: You know what my job is?

DEAN: You mean besides locking up the good guys? (Walks over to HENRIKSEN) I have no idea.

HENRIKSEN: My job is boring, it’s frustrating. You work three years for one break, and then maybe you can save ... a few people. Maybe. That’s the payoff. I’ve been busting my ass for 15 years to nail a handful of guys and all this while, there’s something off in the corner so big. So yeah… sign me up for that big, frosty mug of wasting my damn life.

DEAN: You didn't know.

HENRIKSEN: Now I do. (Pause) What’s out there? Can you guys beat it? Can you win?

DEAN: Honestly? I think the world’s gonna end bloody. But it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t fight. We do have choices. I choose to go down swingin’.

HENRIKSEN: Plus you got nothing to go home to but your brother.

DEAN: Yeah. (nods) What about you? You rockin’ the white picket fence?

HENRIKSEN: Mmm-mm. Empty apartment, string of angry ex-wives. I’m right where you are. (chuckles)

DEAN: Imagine that.

There is a crash and DEAN and HENRIKSEN run into the office where PHIL broke the salt line, followed by SAM. A woman has broken in.

HENRIKSEN: (pointing his rifle) How do we kill her?

SAM: We don’t. (He lowers HENRIKSEN’s rifle)

HENRIKSEN: She’s a demon.

SAM: She’s here to help us.

PHIL and NANCY are now looking around the corner.

PHIL: Are you kidding?

RUBY is standing near the window, breathing heavily. DEAN sighs in exasperation.

RUBY: Are you gonna let me out?

HENRIKSEN looks at DEAN. SAM scratches the devil’s trap on the floor with his knife so RUBY can get in.

RUBY: And they say chivalry’s dead. Does anyone have a breath mint? Some guts splattered in my mouth while I was killing my way in here.

RUBY walks past everyone into the main office. DEAN and HENRIKSEN follow her, while SAM stays to fix the salt line.

BACK TO: OFFICE

DEAN: How many are out there?

RUBY: 30 at least. That’s so far.

DEAN: Oh, good. 30. 30 hit men all gunning for us. Who sent them?

RUBY looks at SAM, who is now standing in the doorway.

RUBY: You didn’t tell Dean?

DEAN looks at SAM, confused.

RUBY: Oh, I’m surprised.

DEAN: Tell me what?

RUBY: There’s a big new up and corner. Real pied piper.

DEAN: Who is he?

RUBY: Not he. Her. Her name is Lilith.

DEAN: Lilith?

RUBY: And she really, really wants Sam’s intestines on a stick. ‘Cause she sees him as competition.

DEAN: You knew about this? (SAM doesn’t answer) Well, gee, Sam. Is there anything else I should know?!

RUBY: How about the two of you talk about this later? We’ll need the Colt. (RUBY looks at SAM, who doesn’t meet her eyes. She looks at DEAN) Where’s the Colt?

SAM: It got stolen.

RUBY: I’m sorry. I must have blood in my ear. I thought I just heard you say that you were stupid enough to let the Colt get grabbed out of your thick, clumsy, idiotic hands. Fantastic. This is just peachy…

SAM: Ruby…

RUBY: Shut up. (She raises her hand) Fine. Since I don’t see that there’s no other any option. There’s one other way I know how to get you out of here alive.

DEAN: What’s that?

RUBY: I know a spell. It’ll vaporize every demon in a one-mile radius. Myself included. So, you let the Colt out of your sight and now I have to die. So next time, be more careful. How’s that for a dying wish?

DEAN: Okay, what do we need to do?

RUBY: Aww… you can’t do anything. This spell is very specific. It calls for a person of virtue.

DEAN: (Nods) I got virtue.

RUBY: (Chuckles) Nice try. You’re not a virgin.

DEAN: (Laughs) Nobody’s a virgin.

RUBY looks at DEAN, then at NANCY, who looks away.

DEAN: No. No way. You’re kidding me, r–. You’re…

NANCY: What? It’s a choice, okay?

DEAN: So, y-you’ve never… Not even once? I mean not even – Wow.

NANCY: So, this spell. What can I do? (Smiles at RUBY)

RUBY: You can hold still ... while I cut your heart out of your chest.

NANCY: What?

DEAN: What? Are you crazy?

RUBY: I’m offering a solution.

DEAN: You’re offering to kill somebody.

RUBY: And what do you think’s gonna happen to this girl when the demons get in?

HENRIKSEN: We’re gonna protect her. That’s what.

NANCY: Excuse me.

RUBY: Very noble.

NANCY: Ex– excuse me.

RUBY: You’re all gonna die. Look. This is the only way.

DEAN: Yeah, yeah. There’s no way that you’re gonna—

NANCY: Would everybody please shut up?! (DEAN and RUBY look at NANCY) All the people out there… will it save them?

RUBY: It’ll blow the demons out of their bodies. So if their bodies are okay… yeah.

NANCY: (Long pause, then she nods) I’ll do it.

HENRIKSEN: Hell no.

DEAN: No, no.

HENRIKSEN: Hell no.

DEAN:You don’t need to do this.

NANCY: All my friends are out there.

HENRIKSEN: We don't sacrifice people. We do that, we’re no better than them.

RUBY: We don’t have a choice.

DEAN: Yeah, well, your choice is not a choice.

RUBY: Sam, you know I’m right.

DEAN and RUBY look at SAM, who is silent.

DEAN: (He smiles slightly in the expectation that SAM will agree with him) Sam? (SAM says nothing) What the hell is going on? Sam, tell her.

NANCY: It’s my decision.

RUBY: Damn straight, cherry pie.

DEAN: Stop! Stop! Nobody kill any virgins. Sam, I need to talk to you.

DEAN walks into the hallway and SAM follows.

DEAN: Please tell me you’re not actually considering this. We’re talking about holding down a girl and cutting out her heart.

SAM: And we’re also talking about 30 people out there, Dean. Innocent people who are all gonna die, along with everyone in here.

DEAN: It doesn’t mean that we throw away the rule book and stop acting like humans. I’m not gonna let that demon kill some nice, sweet, innocent girl, who hasn’t even been laid. I mean, look, if that’s how you win wars, then I don’t want to win.

SAM: Then what? What do we do, Dean?

DEAN: (Turns away for a moment, then back) I got a plan. I’m not saying it's a good one. I’m not even saying that it’ll work. But it sure as hell beats killing a virgin.

SAM: Okay, so, what’s the plan?

DEAN: Open the doors, let them all in and we fight.

ACT FOUR
OFFICE

SAM walks in.

DEAN: Get the equipment to work?

SAM: Yeah.

DEAN: So?

SAM: So this is insane.

RUBY: You win “understatement of the year.”

DEAN: Look, I get it, you think—

RUBY: I don’t think… I know. It’s not gonna work. (She stands up and starts to leave) So long, boys.

SAM: So, you’re just gonna leave?

RUBY: Hey. I was gonna kill myself to help you win. I’m not gonna stand here and watch you lose. (Walks closer to SAM) And I’m disappointed because I tried. I really did, but clearly I bet on the wrong horse. (SAM says nothing) Do you mind letting me out?

CUT TO: FRONT DOOR. Someone uses a knife to scratch away the paint forming the devil’s trap, and then breaks the salt line across the doorway. RUBY walks outside, where the demons are waiting. She draws her knife.

RUBY: I’m leaving. Who wants to stop me?

The demons make way for RUBY to pass. The demon who possessed JENNA’s body smiles cruelly.


INSIDE OFFICE
SAM, DEAN, and HENRIKSEN ready in their positions at different spots in the building. SAM is in the main office, while DEAN and HENRIKSEN are near outside doors.

DEAN: All set?

SAM: Yeah!

HENRIKSEN: Ready!

DEAN: Let’s do this.

They break the salt lines and devil’s traps protecting the doors. HENRIKSEN throws open an outside door. At first, nothing happens, but then suddenly a demon swings from the doorway and kicks at HENRIKSEN with his feet. Demons run inside and DEAN and SAM shoot. A demon tackles SAM to the ground. One of the demons pins HENRIKSEN against the wall. SAM fights hand-to-hand with the demon who tackled him. HENRIKSEN reaches for a flask from his pocket.

HENRIKSEN: God, I hope this works.

HENRIKSEN opens the flask and splashes holy water on the demon. He grabs his gun and moves further down the hallway. He and DEAN each shoot a demon while back to back.

DEAN: Go! Go! Go!

HENRIKSEN and DEAN move in opposite directions. HENRIKSEN swings at a demon with his rifle in a hallway and SAM fights with the demons in the main office. There are now many demons in the building.

OUTSIDE: NANCY and PHIL are on the roof watching as more demons run into the building.

NANCY: When this is over, I’m gonna have so much sex. (PHIL looks at NANCY) But not with you. We better move.

INSIDE: DEAN fights demons in a hallway.

OUTSIDE: NANCY closes a door to the building and lines it with salt.

INSIDE: SAM flings holy water at demons in the main office.

OUTSIDE: NANCY and PHIL line the door and windows with salt.

INSIDE: SAM and DEAN fling holy water at the demons. When their flasks are empty, the demons gather around them.

OUTSIDE: NANCY and PHIL take their salt bags and run along the building.

INSIDE: JENNA DEMON climbs over a desk and walks towards SAM. She stretches out an arm, which sends SAM and DEAN flying against the wall. They gasp in pain and look at each other.

DEAN: Henriksen, now!

CUT TO: Audio room. HENRIKSEN struggles with a demon as he tries to play a tape. He manages to turn it on and SAM’s voice speaking an exorcism comes from speakers all over the office. The demons cover their ears.

INSIDE: SAM (from recording): Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii...

OUTSIDE: NANCY is lining a door with salt when a demon bursts out the door. NANCY screams and the demon looks at her with black eyes before he flees. PHIL grabs the bag from NANCY and finishes lining the door.

SAM (from recording): Omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica, ergo, draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica, adjuramus te, cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque æternæ perditionìs venenum propinare vade, satana, inventor et magister omnis fallaciæ, hostis humanæ salutis, humiliare sub potenti manu dei...

As the exorcism continues to air over the loudspeakers, demons flail and scream. JENNA reaches up to cover her ears. SAM and DEAN are still pinned to the wall. Demons pound against the outside doors, trying to get out. Black smoke begins to pour from the demons’ mouths. The bodies of the possessed people fall to the ground as the smoke swirls around the ceiling.

SAM (from recording): Contremisce et effuge, invocato a nobis sancto et terribili nomini quem inferi tremunt ab insidiis diaboli, libera nos, domine. exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica ergo, draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica, adjuramus te cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque æternæ perditionìs venenum propinare ut ecclesiam tuam secura tibi facias libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos!

OFFICE: There is an explosion of light on the ceiling, then everything goes still. SAM and DEAN slide down the wall to the floor and look at each other. They get to their feet, groaning. HENRIKSEN walks into the office and chuckles slightly as he wipes blood from his lip. DEAN shrugs. The people who had been possessed start to get up. The electricity flickers back on.


LATER
HENRIKSEN: I better call in. Hell of a story I won’t be telling.

SAM: So what are you gonna tell them?

HENRIKSEN: The least ridiculous lie I can come up with in the next five minutes.

DEAN: Good luck with that. Not to pressure you or anything, but what are you planning to do about us?

HENRIKSEN: I’m gonna kill you. Sam and Dean Winchester were in the chopper when it caught on fire. Nothing left. Can’t even identify them with dental records. (SAM smiles) Rest in peace, guys.

SAM and DEAN shake hands with HENRIKSEN.

HENRIKSEN: Now get out of here.

SAM: Yeah…

SAM and DEAN leave as HENRIKSEN places a call.


LATER
A woman walks into the police station holding a LITTLE GIRL by the hand. The LITTLE GIRL walks up to NANCY, who is sweeping the main office.

NANCY: Well hey there.

LITTLE GIRL: Excuse me. I’m looking for two boys. They’re brothers.

HENRIKSEN is sitting on a desk and PHIL standing nearby looking at a file.

LITTLE GIRL: One’s really tall and one’s really cute.

NANCY: (Laughs) What’s your name, sweetie?

LITTLE GIRL: Lilith. (Her eyes turn white)

PHIL and NANCY realize that the LITTLE GIRL is LILITH THE DEMON. HENRIKSEN tries to react but it’s too late. LILITH raises her hand and white light fills the office. HENRIKSEN, NANCY and PHIL scream.

ACT FIVE
MOTEL: SAM is lying on his back on a bed when there is a knock at the door. SAM sits up and DEAN opens the door. It’s RUBY.

RUBY: (Walks into the room) Turn on the news.

SAM turns on the television.

REPORTER ON TV: The community is still reeling from the tragedy that happened just a few hours ago. Authorities believe a gas main ruptured...

DEAN sits down on the other bed opposite SAM.

REPORTER ON TV: ...causing the massive explosion that ripped apart the police station and claimed the lives of everyone inside. Among the deceased, at least six police officers and staff, including sheriff Melvin Dodd, deputy Phil Amici, and secretary Nancy Fitzgerald as well as three FBI agents, identified as Steven Groves, Calvin Reidy, and Victor Henriksen.

The news shows their pictures.

REPORTER ON TV: Two fugitives in custody were also killed. We’ll continue to follow the story here at the scene, but for now, back to you, Jim.

RUBY turns off the television and looks at SAM and DEAN with an “I-told-you-so” look.

SAM: Must have happened right after we left.

RUBY: Considering the size of the blast (RUBY tosses hex bags to DEAN and SAM) ... smart money’s on Lilith.

DEAN: What’s in these?

RUBY: Something that’ll protect you. Throw Lilith off your trail… for the time being, at least.

SAM: Thanks.

RUBY: Don’t thank me. Lilith killed everyone. She slaughtered your precious little virgin, plus a half a dozen other people. So after your big speech about humanity and war, turns out your plan? was the one with the body count. Do you know how to run a battle? You strike fast and you don’t leave any survivors. So no one can go running to tell the boss. So next time… we go with my plan.

RUBY leaves. DEAN looks at SAM.
