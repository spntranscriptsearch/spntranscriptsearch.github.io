TEASER
TITLE: NOW


INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

A man (JASON) drags a body bag through the house into the bathroom. He unzips the bag to reveal a charred body.


EXT. PARK - DAY

DEAN is lying on a picnic table. Sam sits down next to him.


SAM

So, what, Cas is human?


DEAN

(sitting up)

Ish. I mean, he's got no Grace, no wings, no... harp, whatever the hell else he had.


SAM

Okay. Where'd he crash-land?


DEAN

Called me from a pay phone from Longmont, Colorado. I told him just to make for the bunker.


SAM

Well, you think he can handle a road trip like that?


DEAN

Well, Cas is a big boy. Things go Breaking Bad, he knows our number. Right now we got bigger worries.


SAM

The fallen angels?


DEAN

Yeah. I mean, thanks to Metatron, we now have a couple of thousand confused loose nukes walking around down here.


SAM

What do you think they're gonna do?


DEAN

I got no damn clue.


SAM

What about Crowley? You, uh... [mimes slicing throat]


DEAN

I would've loved nothing better than to ice that limey bitch. But then I thought to myself, what would Sam Winchester do?


SAM

I'd've stabbed him in the brain.


DEAN

Oh. (beat) Well, I figured the King of Hell might know a few things, so why not Zero Dark Thirty his ass?


They get up off the table.


SAM

Wait, so Crowley is... alive?


DEAN opens the Impala's trunk to reveal CROWLEY.


DEAN

Oh yeah. He's the junk in my trunk.


A Devil's Trap has been painted on the inside of the trunk.


SAM

Huh.


INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

Sigils have been drawn on the bathroom's walls in blood. BLACK DEMON SMOKE swirls around just below the ceiling. JASON takes out a knife and flips it open. His eyes turn black. He cuts open his wrist and allows the blood to pour into the bathtub. Bright light starts to emanate from it, and the DEMON SMOKE flies down into the tub. The light pulsates and dies out with a small shockwave.

ABADDON emerges from the bathtub.


TITLE: SUPERNATURAL


ACT ONE
INT. BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

DEAN enters the bunker. An arrow comes flying in his general direction, getting stuck in the handrail a few feet in front.


DEAN

The hell?


KEVIN stands up from behind his barricade of books and a flipped-over table, holding a crossbow.


KEVIN

Dean? You're alive!


DEAN

Yeah, 'cause you're a crappy shot...(DEAN pulls the arrow out of the handrail.)...Katniss.


KEVIN

Sorry. It's been a bad couple of days. I-I haven't slept, or eaten, I...I'm pretty backed up.


DEAN

Okay, overshare.


KEVIN

After we talked, this place went nuts, alright? Th-there was some alarm, and all the machines were freaking out, and the bunker just locked down! I couldn't open the door, my cellphone stopped working, I thought the world was ending!


DEAN

Close. (beat) The angels fell.


KEVIN

The... what does that mean?


DEAN

Nothing good. [he takes the crossbow from KEVIN] Listen, next time the world's ending, grab a gun.


DEAN puts the crossbow down on the table and starts to walk away, taking out his cellphone.


DEAN

I got service.


KEVIN flips a switch on the bunker's control panel. Lights turn on and there's a sound of mechanics whirring into action.


KEVIN

It's back online. Maybe when you opened the door from the outside door, it reset the system.


DEAN

Yeah, okay, let's go with that.


SAM enters with CROWLEY, handcuffed, blindfolded and with earmuffs on.


SAM

Hey. All good?


DEAN

Is it ever. Come on.


SAM and DEAN leave with CROWLEY as KEVIN looks on.


KEVIN

(Whispers) No.


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

CROWLEY has been chained to a chair in the center of a Devil's Trap. DEAN pulls off his hood and tears the duct tape off his mouth.


CROWLEY

Ahh! Hello.


DEAN punches him in the face.


DEAN

Never get tired of doing that.


CROWLEY grunts and looks at the wall full of torture implements.


CROWLEY

Homey. Where did you get this fantastic little treehouse?


SAM

Alright, here's how it's gonna go. You're giving us the name of every demon on earth, and the people they're possessing.


CROWLEY

Am I? Doesn't sound like me.


SAM

I saw you break down, Crowley. When I was trying to cure you, I know a part of you was human again, maybe still is.


CROWLEY

Blah blah, boohoo. Done? Good. 'Cause this is what I know. I'm not giving you anything. Why would I? You have no leverage, darlings. You're not gonna close the gates of Hell, because you didn't, you're not gonna kill me, because you haven't. So what's left?


DEAN

We have a few ideas.


CROWLEY

Torture. Brilliant. Can't wait to see Sam in stilettos and a leather bustier, really putting the S-A-M into S&M. Honestly, boys. What are you gonna do to me that I don't do to myself just for kicks every Friday night?


SAM and DEAN exchange a look, then turn and leave, locking the dungeon's doors behind them.


DEAN

Have fun.


They turn off the lights, leaving CROWLEY alone in the dark.

CROWLEY

(Scoffs) Huh.


INT. BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

KEVIN

What's Crowley doing here?! Why isn't he dead?! Why aren't you stabbing him right now?!


DEAN

Alright, alright, chill out, Kevin, okay? We need him.


KEVIN

What?!


SAM

Kevin, look. If we can get Crowley to give us the name of every demon he's got topside, we can hunt them down. All of 'em.


DEAN

He will break, okay. When he does, we'll hold him down while you knife him. Then we all go out for ice cream and strippers.


SAM

Just stay away from him, alright?


KEVIN

So now what?


DEAN

I gotta make some phone calls. You need to hit the Angel tablet, see if you can find anything on the spell that Metatron used to empty out Heaven.


SAM

Yeah, maybe we can reverse it before the God Squad does too much damage.


DEAN

Yeah, if we're lucky. Alright, check the net for anything angel-y.


SAM

Or demon-y.


DEAN

Or monster-y. Or ghost-y, or... it's gonna be a busy year.


INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

ABADDON addresses JASON plus three other DEMONS.


ABADDON

My name is Abaddon. But enough about me, let's talk you. Jason tells me you're all violent, power-hungry opportunists. So maybe you can tell me what the hell happened to Hell. And demons, I mean, [mocking laughter] you call that a meatsuit?


OLD LADY!DEMON

I closed 72 deals last year. Kids love Grandma.


ABADDON

And that's the problem. Deals. We're paying for what we should be taking. Who put Crowley in charge?! What's the matter, Hellhound got your tongue? You took orders from him!


OLD LADY!DEMON

He's the King!


ABADDON

He's a salesman! A king fights. A king conquers. A king does more than sit around reading contracts. But the King's dead. Long live the Queen. I can train you. I can get you new bodies. And we will march into Hell, where we will be greeted as liberators. And Demonkind will rise up and sweep over the earth! And all the humans, and all the angels with their clipped wings will bow to me! (Whispers) Or they will burn.


OLD LADY!DEMON

What about Crowley?


ABADDON

Crowley's dead.


OLD LADY!DEMON

Uhuh. Well, no offense, honey, but we all thought you were dead until, like, a week ago. And what if Crowley does come back? Look, a lot of us were scared of him, a lot of us still are. Prove that Crowley's really gone, and then maybe this scheme of yours will work. (beat) Or not. Honestly, I always thought you Knights were overrated.


ABADDON grabs her by the throat and smokes her out.


ABADDON

You go to hell... And you tell them... I'm coming.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - DAY

DEAN's on the phone while SAM and KEVIN do research.


DEAN

Yeah, Irv, fallen angels.


IRV (O.S.)

Huh. That's a wrinkle.


DEAN

Well, trust me, they're just monsters with good PR.


EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

IRV sits on the hood of his car.


DEAN (O.S., cont'd)

So, if you run into one, torch his ass with holy oil.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

DEAN (cont'd)

Oh, and if they drop, uh, like, a silver sword, grab it. Those pigstickers come in handy.


EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

IRV

Okay. Criminy.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

Hey, look, I know this is weird, but—


IRV (O.S.)

Well, Dean-o, weird's what we do.


EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

IRV

I remember this case me and Bobby worked up in Saskatoon, had these two—


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

Werewolf siamese twins.


EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

IRV

He told you about that?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

Every time he drank Labatt's.


EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

DEAN (O.S., cont'd)

So if you run into any problems, give a call, okay?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

DEAN (cont'd)

The more hunters that know, the better.


EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

IRV

Roger-Dodger.


EXT. NAVAL BASE - DAY

Three NAVY SOLDIERS leave the base.


SOLDIER #1

So, this is your first weekend pass into town, right? So I set it all up. Jamie's waiting at the bar and has a thing for men in uniform. So, you just start buying shots, then you can thank me in the morning.


SOLDIER #2

Cool.


A bus pulls up and the three get in.


INT. BUS - DAY

The DEMONS from before (minus the one possessing the old lady) are waiting on the bus. Their eyes turn black. The doors snap shut and the DEMONS smoke out, then possess the SOLDIERS. ABADDON, in the driver's seat dressed in a bus driver's uniform, turns to look.


ABADDON

Now that is more like it.


ACT TWO
EXT. ROAD - DAY

A young woman (TRACY) is looking under the hood of her car. A van pulls up.


DRIVER

Need some help?


TRACY

Um, yeah, I-I don't know, I think the thingy broke.


DRIVER

Well, I can give you a lift into town.


TRACY

That would be amazing. Thanks.


She grabs her bag from the car while the van's DRIVER leers at her. He grins wolfishly as she gets in, revealing a set of vampire fangs.


EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

The van rocks up and down. After a few moments, blood splashes against the window from the inside. The van's doors open and the VAMPIRE comes falling out, headless. TRACY jumps out after and comes face to face with the possessed SOLDIERS.


JASON (now in SOLDIER #1)

Nice hunting.


DEMON!SOLDIER #2 grabs her from behind and pulls a bag over her head.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

The bus has been abandoned in a parking lot. The area has been marked off with yellow tape and there are multiple police officers and army personnel present. SAM and DEAN pull up in the Impala.


SAM

Oh, God. This place reeks of sulfur.


DEAN

Between the stink, with the freak thunderstorms, and every cow dead within three miles, I'll take demons for $1000, Alex. [to the SERGEANT that walks up] Hey. Agents Stark and Banner, FBI. Just need to have a look around.


SERGEANT

Why? This is a military case, not a federal one.


SAM

Well, that's not what our supervisor said.


SERGEANT

That so? Then maybe him and I oughta have a chat.


DEAN

Okay.


He takes out his phone and dials.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS


KEVIN is seen trying to read the Angel Tablet.


KEVIN's phone rings.


KEVIN

Hey?


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

Hey, boss, uh... we got a little problem here.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

"Boss"?


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

Yeah, just a local badge needs confirmation we're supposed to be here. How the word came down from FBI headquarters in DC.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

Wait, w-what?


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

Yeah.


He hands his phone to the SERGEANT.


SERGEANT

This is Sargent Miranda Bates, who am I talking to?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

Uh... Kevin. Solo.


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

SERGEANT

How old are you?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

Old enough. And I'm with the FBI, so you have to do what I say, or...


SERGEANT (O.S.)

Listen, kid, I don't have to do anything. And I don't take orders from the Feebs.


KEVIN pulls his laptop towards him and starts typing.


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

SERGEANT (cont'd)

So unless you can give me one good reason you got a couple of pretty-boy agents poking around my crime scene, I'm gonna put them in cuffs and spank your ass raw, understand?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

Cabo, last June.


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

SERGEANT

What?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

That's my reason. My favorite is you in a sombrero doing a body shot off some naked guy in a Luchador mask. Super classy.


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

SERGEANT

How did you find that?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

'Cause I'm Kevin freaking Solo. So unless you want this forwarded to your commanding officer, Major Velasquez...


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN (O.S.)

I suggest you give my guys anything they want. Understand?


SERGEANT

Yes.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

Yes, "sir."


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

SERGEANT

Yes, sir.


She hands the phone back to DEAN and stalks off uncomfortably.


DEAN

Kevin? What the hell did you just do?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

All military computers are linked to the same network.


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

SAM motions "are we good?" to DEAN, who nods. SAM walks off towards the bus.


DEAN

And?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

I hacked it.


EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

Hey, Kevin? Good job, buddy.


He hangs up and joins SAM.


INT. BUS - DAY

DEAN

Hey. Anything?


SAM

Yeah, this guy was shot in the heart.


DEAN

That what killed him?


SAM

Maybe—fifteen, twenty years ago. Every one of these bodies has a fatal wound, or two, or three, but they're all old.


DEAN

So we're looking at meatsuits? The bodies took a licking, and the demons inside kept them ticking.


SAM

Probably. I think they were possessed. And now those soldiers are.


The SERGEANT enters.


SERGEANT

Excuse me, agents? We pulled this off a security camera. You might wanna take a look.


She hands SAM a touchscreen tablet with video footage that shows the possessed soldiers and bus driver exiting the bus. SAM zooms in on the driver. The driver is ABADDON


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

DEAN

Abaddon? Seriously?! I thought you Kentucky fried that meatsuit.


SAM

I did, Dean.


DEAN

You—well, then how'd she get it back? [to the police officer holding up the crime scene tape] Thank you. [to SAM] And why's she playing G.I. Joe?


SAM

No clue. Why don't you ask her when we find her?


DEAN

Oh, I will. And then I'm gonna chop her freaking head off. Again.


EXT. CONTAMINATED GHOST TOWN - NIGHT

The DEMONS are beating up hunter PETE.


JASON

Alright, Pete. The Winchesters, where are they?


PETE

Bite me.


JASON punches him again.


JASON

I said, where are the Winchesters?


PETE

And I said, bite me, crewcut.


JASON punches him again.


ABADDON

Let me show you how it's done, boys.


She grabs a noose and slips it around PETE's neck.


PETE

Help me!


He screams as ABADDON tightens the noose and pulls on the rope to lift him off the ground.


ABADDON

You can scream all you want to. No one's gonna hear you! Now let's talk Sam and Dean.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - NIGHT

A cellphone (in a box full of them) starts ringing. KEVIN picks it up.


KEVIN

Hello?


EXT. CONTAMINATED GHOST TOWN - CONTINUOUS

ABADDON

This is Dean's number, but you're not a Winchester. Who are you?


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

I'm... nobody.


INT. ABANDONED DINER - CONTINUOUS

ABADDON enters the diner.


ABADDON

Well, nobody, I need you to give those boys a message for me.


She walks over to TRACY and IRV, both tied up and gagged.


ABADDON (cont'd)

I have something they might want.


INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

SAM

(on phone)

Kevin, wait wait wait. Slow down.


KEVIN (O.S.)

She gave me these coordinates. 44.053051 by -123.127860, and two names. Irv Franklin and Tracy Bell.


DEAN

Irv's a friend, don't know Tracy.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

Alright, the lady said they were hunters, and that if you didn't go save them, that she would kill them.


INT. IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

Yeah, I've heard that song before.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

Dean, who was she?


INT. IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

She's the bad guy. Alright, new job, dig up everything the Men of Letters have on Knights of Hell.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

KEVIN

"Knights of Hell"? (beat) Sure.


INT. IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

DEAN

You find a way to kill one, I mean permanently, drop a dime.


SAM

Thanks, Kevin. [he hangs up] The numbers point to a spot on the outskirts of Eugene, Oregon. You know this is a trap, right?


DEAN

Yep.


SAM

And we're just gonna walk right into it?


DEAN

Guns blazing. You with me?


SAM

You know it.


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

CROWLEY still sits in the dark, flashing back to the night of the third trial.


SAM

You're the third trial, Crowley.


CROWLEY

Where do I start...


DEAN

You're our bitch.


CROWLEY

...to even look for forgiveness?


DEAN

Your demon ass is going to be a mortal ass pretty damn quick.


CROWLEY

None of this means anything to you?

You're my Marnie, moose.

A-and Hannah, she just, she needs to be loved.


INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

CROWLEY

She deserves it.


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

CROWLEY

She deserves to be loved.


INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

CROWLEY

I deserve to be loved! I just wanna be loved.


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

CROWLEY

I just wanna be loved.


Present-day CROWLEY gasps, distraught. Suddenly, the lights come on.


CROWLEY

Kevin?


INT. BUNKER - ARCHIVES - DAY

CROWLEY (O.S.)

Kevin, I know it's you. I'd recognise the pitter-patter of those little feet anywhere.


KEVIN makes his way to one of the shelves and rifles through a box.


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

CROWLEY

That's right, run. It's what you do.


INT. BUNKER - ARCHIVES - DAY

KEVIN pulls a file from the box and starts to walk away.


CROWLEY (O.S.)

I understand, I do. You're, what's the word?


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

CROWLEY

Weak.


KEVIN yanks open the dungeon's doors.


CROWLEY

Hiya, Kev.


EXT. CONTAMINATED GHOST TOWN - DAY

DEAN

The hell happened here?


SAM

Local chemical plant sprung a leak, years ago. They evacuated three square blocks. Guess it's still contaminated.


DEAN

Wait, so this whole place is poison?


SAM

Yeah.


DEAN shields his crotch with his hand protectively.


SAM

That's not gonna help.


DEAN

Doesn't hurt.


They locate the diner.


INT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

SAM and DEAN enter the diner.


SAM

Dean.


DEAN removes the gag from IRV's mouth.


DEAN

Irv? Hey. Where's Abaddon?


IRV

Abaddon's been torturing hunters. She's trying to get intel on you boys.


SAM

Do you know why?


IRV

I seriously doubt she wants to add you to her Christmas card list. Now, d'you wanna make with the rescue or what?


DEAN

Right after you take a shot of holy water, huh?


SAM and DEAN both unscrew flasks of holy water, and make TRACY and IRV drink some, respectively.


TRACY

Happy?


DEAN

Sorry about that.


IRV

Don't worry about it. Last night you need is us popping black eyes.


SAM

You're Tracy, right? I'm Sam Winchester.


TRACY

Good for you.


IRV

She's new. We did a shifter job in Sacramento together. Smart, but got a mouth on her.


DEAN

Let's gear up.


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

CROWLEY

So, what brings you to my boudoir, handsome?


KEVIN

You're gonna tell me how to kill a Knight of Hell.


CROWLEY

Abaddon giving you trouble, eh? Tell you what, you let me go, and I'll spit-roast the little whore for you. Sound good?


KEVIN

You're bluffing. You don't know.


CROWLEY

Oh, I know plenty. For example, I know she'd love you. Skinny, submissive... you're just her type.


KEVIN

Shut up.


CROWLEY

Fine. That's not what you came for, anyway, not really. What's on your mind, Kevin? You can tell me. We're friends!


KEVIN

You tortured me.


CROWLEY

I torture all my friends. It's how I show love. I was raised in a dysfunctional home environment.


KEVIN

You killed my mom!


CROWLEY

Did I? (beat) I mean, are you sure? Did you ever see her body? I mean, how can you be sure she's dead?


KEVIN screams and punches CROWLEY.


CROWLEY

You can do better than that, little man.


KEVIN glances at the wall full of blades and other equipment. CROWLEY stares at the shelf with content.


CROWLEY

That's right. Let it all out.


KEVIN screams and punches CROWLEY again.


ACT THREE
INT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

DEAN is busy checking their supplies.


DEAN

Alright, we got Jesus juice, guns loaded with Devil's Trapped bullets—shoot a demon, you put 'em on lockdown. The angel blade works...


There's a noise outside and SAM moves over to the window to investigate.


SAM

They're coming.


DEAN

Good.


SAM

And they've got assault rifles.


DEAN

Okay, less good.


IRV

So, what's the play?


EXT. ABANDONED DINER - LATER

The DEMONS approach the diner. DEAN's voice can be heard from inside.


DEAN (O.S.)

Come and get it, you dicks!


INT. ABANDONED DINER - CONTINUOUS

JASON kicks open the door and enters together with DEMON!SOLDIER #2.


JASON

Down, now!


Close-up on DEAN's phone playing a pre-recorded clip on repeat.


DEAN

Come and get it, you dicks!

Come and get it, you dicks!


JASON

Damn it.


EXT. CONTAMINATED GHOST TOWN - DAY

DEAN

Alright. We gotta flank SEAL team douche in there, so, uh, Irv, you and me will go left, and Sam, you and Tracy go right.


SAM

Okay. Let's move.


He lays a hand on TRACY's shoulder, who promptly shoves him away.


TRACY

Don't touch me.


DEAN

Whoa. What's the problem?


TRACY

My family's dead because of him.


SAM

What?


TRACY

I watched a demon slaughter my parents. And the whole time it talked about how it was celebrating. Some dumb kid let Lucifer out of his cage.


DEAN

...okay, alright, we gotta move. Girl's with me, Irv...


IRV

(to SAM)

Okay. Let's go, son.


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

KEVIN drops a bloodied hammer to the ground.


CROWLEY

There. Now that you've felt your feels, maybe we can talk.


KEVIN

No.


CROWLEY

Gonna make this simple, Kevin. Let me go, and I'll give you back your mother.


KEVIN

She's dead.


CROWLEY

Oh, she wishes she was. After what I had my heavies do to her, she's begging for it. But when have you ever known me to let anyone off easy? You think Sam and Dean care about her? Huh? You think they care about you? You are just here to serve their needs. Nothing more. You're gonna lose, Kevin. Everything. It's just a matter of time. When the Winchesters are done with you, they'll toss you aside without a second thought because they can. Because they think they're special. And because, well, there's always another prophet waiting in the wings. I'm the one in chains, but we're both prisoners here. What say, you let me go, and we walk out those doors together? What say we both win?


EXT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

DEAN

Okay, I think they're still inside. We wait till they come out, and we pick them off one by one. (beat) Listen, for the record, Sam's not the only guy who thought he was doing right and watched it all go to crap, okay? That's just part of being—


TRACY

Being a hunter.


DEAN

Being human. Look, you wanna be pissed off at Sam, that's fine, I get it. But if you wanna go after somebody, you make sure that they got black eyes. Gotta know who the real monsters are in this world, kid.


EXT. OTHER SIDE OF ABANDONED DINER - DAY

IRV

Sam, you copacetic?


SAM

Yeah.


IRV

Good. Now, hand me that toothpick and you and Dean and Tracy, you beat feet outta here.


SAM

What?


IRV

I'm going in there alone. I'll buy you as much time as I can.


SAM

Irv, that's death.


IRV

Yeah, well, it's what I've got coming. It's my fault, Sam. I was... in some dive and I was sloppy, and lonely, and I met some girl. And next thing I know, I'm strapped to some bed, and she's twisting things that ain't supposed to be twisted.


SAM

"She" who?


IRV

Abaddon. (starts tearing up) I gave 'em up. Pete, Tracy, I Gave 'em all up. So you hand me that blade, and you let me do what I gotta do, or so help me—


IRV is shot through the heart and drops to the ground, dead. SAM shoots at the SNIPER on the rooftop and makes a break for the diner, diving inside.


INT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

SAM slides in and comes to a stop on the floor in front of JASON, who traps SAM's wrist under his boot.


JASON

Boo.


EXT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

ABADDON emerges and punches DEAN to the floor. TRACY shoots her in the chest repeatedly, but ABADDON barely flinches.


ABADDON

Nice grouping.


She lifts up her shirt to reveal a bulletproof vest.


ABADDON

Kevlar. Beats magic bullets. I love the future.


DEAN flings holy water up at ABADDON, and she staggers backwards, smoke rising from her face. DEAN crawls up and hands TRACY his keys.


DEAN

Listen, my car is three blocks over. Go get more bullets, more holy water, get everything.


TRACY

No, n-no, but what about you?


DEAN

Just go! Go! Now!


TRACY runs off. Behind DEAN, ABADDON has recovered from the holy water attack.


ABADDON

Alone at last.


ACT FOUR
EXT. ABANDONED DINER - CONTINUOUS

DEAN pulls out an angel blade and attempts to stab ABADDON, but she blocks the swing and twists his arm, sending the blade flying.


ABADDON

I missed you. Did you miss me?


She grabs DEAN by the shoulder, dislocating it and forcing him to his knees.


INT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

SAM is fighting both JASON and DEMON!SOLDIER #2, getting thrown over the counter as they overpower him. He scrambles back up as DEMON!SOLDIER #3 enters.


DEMON!SOLDIER #3

Cool, I didn't miss the best part.


EXT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

ABADDON

So appreciate you boys coming when I call. I think that's what I like most about you Winchesters. You're so obedient. And suicidally stupid. I like that, too.


DEAN

Are we gonna fight or make out? 'Cause I'm getting some real mixed signals here.


ABADDON

I want Crowley. Or what's left of him.


DEAN

Yeah? What's in it for me?


ABADDON

I let you die. You give me Crowley's head, and I will snap your neck, quick and clean. You won't feel a thing, trust me.


DEAN

And if I tell you to get bent?


ABADDON

Oh. Well... you know, I've loved this body since the moment I first saw it. You're the perfect vessel, Dean. You give a girl all sorts of nasty ideas. So go ahead and play hard to get, and I'll peel off this "no demons allowed" tattoo and blow smoke up your ass.


DEAN

(Mockingly) Ooh. Well, I gotta tell you, between you and me, it is a horror show up there.


ABADDON

It can get worse. Trust me. 'Cause once I'm on top, I'll make you watch. And I'll use your body. Have you ever felt an infant's blood drip down your chin? Or listened to a girl scream as you rip her guts out? Because you will. It's you and me, lover. We'll have a grand old time.


INT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

SAM gets thrown into a wall and falls down, unconscious.


JASON

And here I thought all you Winchesters were supposed to be tough.


SAM's eyes open and flash blue. ZEKE!SAM sends JASON flying across the diner with a flick of his hand and stands up. He starts radiating white light and on his shadow on the wall behind him, tattered, broken wings unfold.


EXT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

There's a bright flash of white light from within the diner, blasting out all the windows.


ABADDON

An angel?!


DEAN

What, you think we'd roll up to this mouse trap without some backup?


ABADDON grabs DEAN by the throat and throws him aside, then disappears.


INT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

ZEKE!SAM pulls the demon knife out of DEMON!SOLDIER #3's body. DEAN enters.


ZEKE!SAM

They were going to kill him, Dean.


DEAN

Ezekiel? The hell did you do?


ZEKE!SAM

I was protecting your brother. I thought that was what you wanted.


DEAN

Right, yeah, no, I-I... sorry, I'm just still getting used to this whole thing.


ZEKE!SAM

As am I.


DEAN

But Sam's okay?


ZEKE!SAM

He was knocked unconscious. In a way he still is. Sam will not remember any of this.


DEAN

So what the hell am I supposed to tell him when he comes to?


ZEKE!SAM

That's why I used the knife.


DEAN

Right. [he takes the knife back] Smart.


ZEKE!SAM

You are troubled, still.


DEAN

Yeah, it's just that, uh... this is on me. I was the one who talked Sam out of boarding up Hell. Okay? So every demon deal, every kill that they make... well, you're looking at the person who let it happen.


ZEKE!SAM

You were protecting your brother. I am in Sam's head. Everything he knows, I know. And I know that what you did, you did out of love.


DEAN

Yeah, uh, look, Zeke—I'm gonna call you Zeke—I'm not really with the whole, uh, love, and... love.


ZEKE!SAM

But it is why I said yes.


DEAN

Yeah, and if that goes sideways, that's on me too.


ZEKE!SAM

That's not going to happen.


DEAN

This is nuts. I mean, you're Sam, but you're not Sam, and normally he's the one I'm talking to about all this stuff. I'm trusting you, Zeke. I just gotta hope that you're one of the good guys.


ZEKE!SAM

I am. (beat) But I suppose that is what a bad guy would say. (beat) Dean Winchester, you are doing the right thing.


INT. ABANDONED DINER - LATER

DEAN packs their supplies back into the duffel bag. On the other end of the diner, SAM wakes up and groans.


DEAN

Sam? Sammy? Hey, whoa.


SAM

Dean? What the hell happened?


DEAN

You took a shot to the head, and I came in and saved your ass, like usual.


SAM

You killed three demons? Alone?


DEAN

I took 'em by surprise. Got a little messy, I got a little lucky. [he helps SAM up off the floor] Oh, and, uh, I'm awesome, so there's that.


SAM

Jeez. You are pretty damn awesome.


A car pulls up outside, and SAM and DEAN head for the diner's exit.


EXT. ABANDONED DINER - DAY

TRACY pulls up in the Impala.


SAM

Hey. You okay?


TRACY

Yeah. You?


SAM

More or less, yeah.


TRACY

Good. [throws the keys to DEAN] I got everything, but guess I'm late to the party.


DEAN

Lucky you. Let's blow this toxic waste dump. Burgers and Silkwood showers on me.


ACT FIVE
INT. BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

SAM and DEAN enter, DEAN holding a bucket of chicken and a bottle of prune juice.


DEAN

Kevin?!


SAM

Kevin?


The main level of the bunker is deserted. SAM and DEAN exchange a look. DEAN puts down the food and they both run downstairs.


INT. BUNKER - DUNGEON - DAY

DEAN and SAM enter the bunker to find CROWLEY still chained up.

DEAN

Who worked you over?


CROWLEY

Martin Hayward and Brandon Favors.


SAM

They did this to you?


CROWLEY

No. They're demons. You asked for names, I'm giving you names. They're underperformers. Spike them, you'll do me a favor.


DEAN

Wow. You break easy.


CROWLEY

Please. Your little plan to have me stew in my own... delicious... juices... pathetic. You want intel. I want things, too. Maybe we can come to some kind of arrangement. Quid pro quo, gentlemen.


SAM

So these are what, then, freebies?


CROWLEY

Not at all. You can consider them fair trade for the enjoyment that Kevin gave me.


DEAN

What the hell is that supposed to mean?


CROWLEY

He's my new favorite toy. Wind him up, watch him go.


DEAN

(to SAM)

You check the names, I'll go find the kid.


They leave, locking CROWLEY in the dark again.


INT. BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

KEVIN heads towards the exit, carrying a backpack.


DEAN

Where d'you think you're going? [KEVIN walks past, ignoring him] Hey, hey. Hey hey hey, whoa. Talk to me.


KEVIN

You can't keep me locked in here. I'm leaving.


DEAN

Like hell! Man, we told you not to talk to Crowley, okay? He messes with your head.


KEVIN

He said my mom's alive. Crowley said if I let him go, he'd give her back to me.


DEAN

And you believed him.


KEVIN

He's still in there, isn't he?!


DEAN

Crowley's lying.


KEVIN

And if he's not?


DEAN

Well... if she is alive, then she's dead. In every way that matters, she's dead, Kevin, I'm sorry. I know you're dying to bolt, man. I get it. But out that door, it's demons, and it's angels, and they would all love to get their hands on a prophet. So even with Crowley here, this is still the safest place for you. It just is. And we need you, man.


KEVIN

Because I'm useful.


DEAN

Because you're family. (beat) After all the crap we've been through, after all the good that you've done... man, if you don't think that we would die for you... I don't know what to tell you. [KEVIN starts crying] Because you, me, Sam and Cas, we are all we've got. But hey, if none of that matters to you, then I won't stop you.


INT. BUNKER - LIBRARY - DAY

SAM is doing research when DEAN enters.


DEAN

Kevin's passed out in one of the back rooms. He's a tough kid. He'll bounce back. [he pours a drink for SAM and himself] What's up with you?


SAM

Nothing. It's just... what Tracy said about me, she wasn't wrong.


DEAN puts the glasses down on the table and sits down across from SAM.


DEAN

Sam, listen to me. You have helped a hell of a lot more people than you have hurt. So all of that... that was then. Okay? Here's to now.


They clink glasses.


SAM

So, you ready for it?


DEAN

Hmm?


SAM

The fallen angels? Abaddon? Cas losing his halo, Crowley in our basement?


DEAN

Crap. We're living in a freaking sitcom. (beat) What about you, how's the uh, the engine running?


SAM

Honestly, um, I feel better than I have in a long time. I mean, I realize it's crazy out there, and we have trouble coming for us, but I look around and I see friends, and family. I am happy with my life, for the first time in... forever. (beat) I-I am, I really am. It's just, things are... things are good.


DEAN

Never better.


SAM turns back to his research. DEAN's smile falters and he knocks back the remainder of his drink in one gulp.
