TEASER
INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT

Door opens, and a woman and man dressed in formal (JANET and PAUL DUTTON) attire walk in, the man switches on the bedroom light as the woman tosses her purse on the bed.

JANET
That was just a terrible, terrible party.

PAUL
But there was this one really beautiful woman there.

JANET
You should have gone home with her.

PAUL
I did.

They kiss, and he unzips her dress. It falls to the floor.

JANET
I need a few minutes.

PAUL
Alright, there's a bottle of '89 in the fridge.

They kiss and he walks out the door as she crosses the room and enters the bathroom.


INT. AMANDA'S ROOM – NIGHT

A match is struck on the edge of a box as an incantation is being recited which runs through the rest of the action as a voiceover.

END OF TEASER

ACT ONE
INT. DUTTON BEDROOM – DAY
DEAN is questioning PAUL about JANET and SAM is searching the bathroom for clues as to what happened.

PAUL
She was so scared. I couldn't help; I couldn't do anything to stop it. And I've talked to the police, and I've talked to the medical examiner and no one can explain it.

DEAN
Well, that's why they put the call in to us Mr. Dutton.

PAUL
But the CDC, that's disease control, right? What do you think; it's some kind of virus?



INT. BATHROOM – DAY

SAM closes the door to the bathroom and looks more thoroughly through things.

DEAN (V.O.)
We're not ruling out anything yet. Mr. Dutton did Janet have any enemies?

PAUL (V.O.)
I'm sorry?


INT. BEDROOM

DEAN
Anyone that might have a reason to hurt her?

PAUL
Wait, what are you saying? That somebody poisoned her?


INT. BATHROOM

SAM looks under the sink in the bathroom and finds something. The questioning continues in the bedroom.

DEAN (V.O.)
I'm just saying we have to cover every base here.

PAUL (V.O)
Well, I mean, what kind of poison? You think a person could have done this?

DEAN (V.O.)
Would anyone want to?


INT. BEDROOM

PAUL
What?! No, no, there's just no one that could've—

SAM opens the bathroom door.

DEAN
Mr. Dutton?

PAUL
Uh, everyone loved Janet.

SAM nods at DEAN so he knows that SAM is done investigating.

DEAN
Okay. Thank you very much; I think we've got everything we need. We'll get out of your way now.


EXT. DUTTON HOUSE – DAY
It's raining as SAM and DEAN walk out of the house toward the Impala.

DEAN
That dude seem a little evasive to you?

SAM
I don't know I was under a sink, pulling this out.

SAM takes a hex bag out of his pocket and hands it to Dean and they both stop as DEAN takes the bag from SAM and opens it.

SAM
Hex bag.

DEAN
Awww gross.

SAM
Yeah, there are bird bones, rabbit's teeth. This cloth is probably cut from something Janet Dutton owned.

DEAN looks back at the house for a second and turns back handing the bag to SAM and walking towards the IMPALA again.

DEAN
So we're thinking witch?

SAM
Uh, yeah, and not some new age wicked water douser either. This is Old World black magic Dean, I mean, warts and all.


INT. IMPALA – DAY

DEAN gets in and turns to Sam.

DEAN
I hate witches.

SAM chuckles

DEAN
They're always spewing their bodily fluids everywhere.

SAM
Pretty much.

DEAN
It's creepy, you know, it's down right unsanitary.

SAM
Yeah, well someone definitely had it out for Janet Dutton.

DEAN
Yeah, someone who snuck into that house and planted the bag. So what are we thinking, we're uh, looking for some old craggy Blair bitch in the woods.

SAM
No it could be anyone. Neighbor, coworker, man, woman—that's the problem, Dean, they're human, they're like everyone else.

DEAN
Great. How do we find 'em?

SAM
This wasn't random; someone in Janet Dutton's life had an ugly axe to grind. We find the motive—

DEAN
We find the murderer.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN starts the IMPALA and pulls away from the curb, driving off in the rain.



EXT. AMANDA'S HOUSE
ELIZABETH is tending to her garden as AMANDA pulls into her driveway and gets out of the car. ELIZABETH looks up and tries to get AMANDA's attention.

ELIZABETH
Amanda.

AMANDA is distracted and grabs a grocery bag out of the back seat of her car and starts to walk to her door. We see that she has a bandage on her right hand, signifying this is the witch we heard reciting the incantation who cut her hand with the dagger.

ELIZABETH
Hey Amanda!

AMANDA
Oh, Elizabeth hi. Sorry, I've got like a thousand things on my mind.

AMANDA keeps walking toward the door to her house.

ELIZABETH
Are you okay sweetie? You didn't come to book club last night.

AMANDA
Yeah, sorry I was gonna call, I just—I got busy, you know? But I'm fine, really, I am.

AMANDA hurries into her house, waving her hand behind her at ELIZABETH.



INT. AMANDA'S HOUSE
AMANDA walks into the kitchen and sets down the grocery bag on the counter and goes to the oven, opening the door and reaches in to take out a platter with food on it. A buzzing starts in the background and as AMANDA sets the platter on the counter, the food can be seen to be rotten. AMANDA continues to look at the platter as the buzzing intensifies and the camera closes in on the food, showing flies, maggots and worms crawling all over the rooting food.


EXT. STREET – NIGHT

PAUL is sitting in his car pulled over on the side of the street and reaches over and turns on the radio. Every Rose Has its Thorn by Poison starts to play on the radio as he begins to eat a burger.


INT. AMANDA'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The camera pans across the altar in AMANDA's living room showing various occult objects, including a candle, bones and symbols drawn on wood, the same as before. Now she places the platter of rotten food where Janet's toothbrush was and lifts the same dagger she sliced her hand with previously and looks at it.


INT. PAUL DUTTON'S CAR PAUL is chewing the food he has eaten as the song continues. He puts down the burger and goes to check his watch, but his wrist is bare and he looks confused. AMANDA begins the incantation.

AMANDA (V.O.)
Echranmuk madan fiéré marc oh don


INT. AMANDA'S HOUSE

AMANDA places a watch (presumably PAUL's) on the platter with the rotten food and continues her incantation.

AMANDA
Duer kianave kihér tolic einder bolic marc oh don duer kianave. This dinner was cooked for you Paul Arthur Dutton.

AMANDA stabs the dinner with the dagger.

AMANDA
Now you're going to eat it.


INT. PAUL'S CAR

PAUL is chewing and holding his burger as the radio goes static and the song changes to I Put a Spell on You by Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Paul lays down his burger on the passenger seat of his car and maggots fall out onto the wrapper. He reaches and turns off the radio. Picking up his burger again he takes another bite and begins to chew but makes a face and goes to reach in his mouth, lifting his burger and looking down at it. He sees it is covered in maggots.

PAUL
Aah, oh!

PAUL puts down the burger as I Put a Spell on You comes back on the radio and he leans forward starting to choke. He opens the door of his car, falling out onto the pavement hunched over as DEAN and SAM arrive in the Impala. DEAN runs over to PAUL and yells at SAM:

DEAN
Check the car!

SAM searches under the dashboard and steering column as DEAN tries to help PAUL.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM
Got it!

SAM gets up removing the hex bag he found as DEAN pulls Paul up from the pavement.

DEAN
Come on.

SAM lights the hex bag on fire and drops it to the ground as it glows with blue and green flames.


INT. AMANDA'S HOUSE

As she begins to cut her hand with the dagger and continue the ritual, the platter of rotting food bursts into flames.

EXT. STREET

PAUL recovers from choking and leans back against his car.

DEAN
You okay?

PAUL
What the hell is happening to me?!

DEAN
Someone murdered your wife and now they're trying to kill you, that's what's happening to you.

PAUL
That's impossible! There's no way—

DEAN
If we hadn't have been following you, you'd be a doornail right now. Now who wants you dead?

PAUL
I-uh...

DEAN
Come on think.

PAUL
There's a woman—uh—

DEAN
A woman, okay?

PAUL
An affair—a mistake, she was un-balanced, she was blackmailing me and I put an end to it a week ago.

SAM
What's her name?

PAUL
Wha–What could she have to do with—?

DEAN
Paul! What is her name?



INT. AMANDA'S HOUSE
AMANDA is frantically flipping through the pages of a book with occult symbols on it and foreign language written around the symbols. A wind blows through her house blowing out the candles on her altar. AMANDA stares at them warily, then suddenly screams and holds out her left arm where one cut has already been sliced in her wrist vertically. Two more slice down next to that cut with no visible assailant and blood begins to pour out of the wounds.

AMANDA
No! No...aah no!

Three cuts slice into her right wrist vertically, matching those on her left wrist and blood pours out of them despite AMANDA's screams in protest. She falls forward, pushing the altar off the table and lands face down on her glass coffee table, blood from her cut wrists pooling around her arms her eyes shut.

ACT TWO
INT. AMANDA'S HOUSE – NIGHT
DEAN picks the lock and enters AMANDA's house, followed closely by SAM, with their guns drawn. They enter the room and find AMANDA lifeless on the table covered in blood and switch on the light. The flames are still burning, so this is very shortly after she died.

DEAN (staring at the body)
That's a curveball.

SAM
Yeah.

They approach AMANDA's body, and DEAN lifts her right arm with the barrel of his gun then looks at the other as well.

DEAN
Three per wrist, vertical. She wasn't foolin' around.

SAM puts his gun in the back of his jeans and bends down to look at the scattered remnant of the altar holding his nose to the smell of the burnt rotten food.

SAM
Yeah, looks like she was working some heavyweight evil here.

DEAN
Yep.

DEAN turns around, then jumps back, startled – he nearly walked into a rabbit, hanging from the ceiling, dead.

DEAN
Oh god! Freakin' witches! Seriously man, come on!

SAM
Guess we know where she got the rabbit's teeth from.

DEAN
Well, Paul sure knows how to pick 'em huh? It's like Fatal Attraction all over again.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
And why does the rabbit always get screwed in the deal?! The poor little guy.

SAM
You know what I don't get, Dean? If she was so bent on revenge, why do this?

DEAN
Well, she got Janet Dutton, thought she finished off Paul, decided to cap herself and make it a spurned lover's hat-trick.

SAM
Maybe.

SAM starts to look under the glass table that AMANDA is on.

DEAN
I mean, this doesn't exactly look like the TV room of a bright and stable person, you know?

SAM
No, but then...

SAM reaches around and pulls out another hex bag that is tucked under the table and stands up tossing it to DEAN.

SAM
There's this.

DEAN
Another hex bag? Come on!

DEAN opens the bag to find similar contents of the bag they found in JANET's bathroom and he tosses it on the table reaching for his phone.

DEAN
Looks like we got a hit, huh? A little witch-on-witch violence?

SAM
I guess.

DEAN dials the phone and hold it up to his ear.

DEAN
I'd like to report a dead body, 309 Mayfair Circle. My name? Yeah, sure my name is—

DEAN clicks the phone shut, cutting himself off.

DEAN
Why are witches ganking each other?

SAM
I don't know, but I think maybe we got a coven on our hands.



INT. VAN ALLEN HOUSE – NIGHT
Camera pans out from 'Determination' poster on wall to two women sitting on a sofa.

RON is standing in the doorway to the room that the women are in.

RON
All right, all right. I'm going. I'm not fooled by your little book club by the way. I know what you ladies get up to when I'm gone. It's all dish and gossip.

The women laugh as ELIZABETH walks in and joins RON in the doorway.

ELIZABETH
Hi Ron.

RON
Oh, hello Elizabeth. I mean, when's the last time anyone actually brought a book?

TAMMI and RENEE (in unison)
Goodnight Ron.

RON
All right.

RON leaves and as soon as the door closes behind him ELIZABETH goes into the room seemingly upset.

ELIZABETH
He doesn't know? You didn't tell him?

RENEE
About Amanda? Oh, I think that's book club business, don't you?

TAMMI gets a candle holder with three tapers in it and sets it on the coffee table in front of the sofa.

RENEE
Thank you Tammi.

ELIZABETH
The police just took away her body, and what? We're just gonna pretend it didn't happen?

RENEE
We loved Amanda.

TAMMI
It's true.

RENEE
We know that she was a little... unstable.

TAMMI
Also true.

RENEE
And we have to face it, she probably killed Janet Dutton.

TAMMI
People just don't spit out their teeth all of a sudden.

RENEE shakes her head in agreement with TAMMI

ELIZABETH
We have to stop. We have to stop Book Club. This has all gone too far.

RENEE gets up from the sofa.

RENEE
Elizabeth, just take a deep breath. Calm down.

TAMMI
We can't... stop.

ELIZABETH
But people are dying!

RENEE scoffs.

RENEE
Amanda killed herself yes. And yes, she killed Janet. (tsk-tsk clicks her teeth) Awful, awful business of course, but that's all over now. And think about what Book Club has gotten us hmm? Your husband's promotion, that little trip to Hawaii that you won. And what about me? My home pottery business is finally taking off and you wanna just stop? Do you wanna stop?

ELIZABETH shakes her head 'no' and RENEE claps her hands together.

RENEE
'kay, now come on, we don't have much time, Ron gets back from his Fantasy Football in an hour.

The three of them start getting ready for 'Book Club' which is their witches coven meeting by putting a cloth with a demonic symbol on it down on the table, putting the 'Book of Shadows' in the middle of it, and lighting the candles in the candle holder.

TAMMI, RENEE & ELIZABETH
Book of Shadows we kneel before you, let us serve your master as you serve us.
Book of Shadows we kneel before you, let us serve your master—


EXT. ELIZABETH'S GARDEN – DAY
ELIZABETH is turning the soil of her garden with a small trowel when DEAN and SAM walk up her driveway to question her.

SAM
You must have a green thumb.

ELIZABETH
Excuse me?

SAM
Getting these herbs to grow out of season like this, quite impressive. I'm sorry; I should have introduced myself first.

SAM reaches on the pocket of his suit jacket and takes out a badge.

SAM
I'm uh, Detective Bachman, this is Detective Turner.

DEAN takes his own badge out of his jacket pocket and flashes it at ELIZABETH.

DEAN
Hi-ya.

SAM
We're following up on Amanda Burns' death, going around the neighborhood and talking to neighbors and stuff like that.

ELIZABETH
But didn't she— I mean she killed herself right?

SAM
Maybe, maybe.

DEAN
We heard you were friends with the deceased right?

ELIZABETH
Yeah, I guess so.

DEAN
Did you have any idea about her practices?

ELIZABETH
I'm sorry, what kind of practices?

SAM
Well see, her house was littered with Satanic paraphernalia.

DEAN
A regular Black Sabbath.

ELIZABETH
No, the— but she was an Episcopalian.

DEAN
Well, then we're pretty sure she was using the wrong Bible. (chuckles)

RENEE and TAMMI walk up unseen, and RENEE speaks causing the brothers to turn and take notice of their arrival.

RENEE
Elizabeth, you all right?

ELIZABETH
I'm fine uh Renee, these are detectives. They say Amanda was— she was practicing—

RENEE
I'm sorry detectives; you can tell that Elizabeth is a little bit upset.

DEAN
Of course, Miss ... ?

RENEE
Missus. Renee. Van Allen. (She says it slowly and emphatically, like it's significant and she's important.) Would you like me to spell it for you?

DEAN
I'll get by, thanks.

RENEE
This Amanda business has been hard for Liz. For all of us.

TAMMI
Yeah. I mean, you think you know a person.

DEAN
Well, I guess we all have secrets don't we?

SAM
Well, thanks, um, we'll be in touch.

DEAN
Have a nice day.

TAMMI
Bye.

The camera pans across TAMMI, LIZ, and RENEE's faces.



EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

The IMPALA is driving down a country road through fog.
INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN is driving and SAM is in the passenger's seat.

DEAN
Well, I'm already sold on that Elizabeth chick. Did you see that victory garden of hers? Belladonna, wolfsbane, mandrake, not to mention that little flinch she threw when we mentioned the occult.

SAM
Well, she's definitely had a good run lately, gone up a few tax brackets; won almost too many raffles. Kinda thing a little black magic always helps with.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
I don't think she's alone either. Looks like 'MRS. Renee Van Allen' has won almost every craft contest she has entered in the past three months.

DEAN
Yeah, a regular Martha Stewart, huh? Except for the devil worship, I'm thinking that was the coven we met back there, minus one member.

SAM
Amanda was clearly going off the reservation. What do you think, they killed her to keep up appearances?

DEAN
Seems like an appearance kind of crowd, don't you think?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
If they killed the nut-job, should we uh, thank them or what?

SAM
They're working black magic too, Dean. They need to be stopped.

DEAN
'Stopped' like stopped?

SAM gives him a look that says 'of course'.

DEAN
They're human, Sam.

SAM
They're murderers.

DEAN looks at SAM for a second with surprise and then shrugs in agreement.

DEAN
Burn witch, burn.

DEAN continues to drive when the IMPALA stutters and starts to choke up.

DEAN
What the hell?


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT
The head lights of the IMPALA flicker on and then back on again as it slowly comes to a stop in front of a figure sanding in the middle of the road. The view from the inside of the IMPALA shows that it is RUBY. SAM gets out of the car first and DEAN follows.

SAM
Ruby.

RUBY
Sam, listen to me, there's no time.

SAM
For what? What are you talking about?

RUBY
You have to get out of town.

DEAN
So this is Ruby, huh?

DEAN raises the Colt and aims it at her, cocking it.

DEAN
Never had the pleasure.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN
I was hoping you'd show up again.

RUBY
Point that thing somewhere else.

DEAN
Hahahaha! Right.

RUBY
Sam, please. Go. Get in the car and don't look back.

SAM
Why? I don't understand.

DEAN
Hey, hot stuff, we can take care of a few kitchen witches, thanks.

RUBY
I'm not talking about witches, you jackass. Witches are whores. I'm talking about who they serve.

DEAN and SAM both look confused for a second, but then it dawns on SAM.

SAM
Demons. They get their power from demons.

RUBY
Yeah. And there's one here, now.

DEAN
Oh, what, you mean besides you?

RUBY
Sam, it knows you're in town and it's gonna come after you and its way more than you can handle.

DEAN
Oh come on, what is this, huh? Please tell me you're not listening to this crap!

RUBY
Put a leash on your brother, Sam, if you wanna keep him.

SAM
Dean, look, just chill out.

DEAN
No! No! She's messing with your head, God knows why, that's who they are!

RUBY
I'm telling you the truth.

DEAN
And I'm telling you to shut up, bitch.

RUBY
I'm sorry, why are you even a part of this conversation?!

DEAN
Oh, I don't know maybe because he's my brother, you black-eyed skank!

RUBY
Oh, right, right. You care about your brother so much. That's why you're checking out in a few months, leaving him all alone?

DEAN
Shut up.

RUBY
At least let me try and save him, since you won't be here to do it any more.

DEAN
I said shut up!

DEAN moves to fire the Colt at RUBY.

SAM
Dean no!

SAM pushes DEAN's arm away from RUBY as he fires the Colt, and DEAN tries to fight against SAM's hold and they lock arms and both look to where RUBY was standing to see that she has vanished.

DEAN gives SAM a look of disappointment and goes back to get in the Impala, as SAM looks around in vain for RUBY.

ACT THREE
INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT
DEAN walks in first and switches on the light and SAM follows right behind him.

DEAN
What the hell were you thinking?

SAM
What?! What the hell was I thinking?

DEAN
She's a demon, Sam. Period. All right? They want us dead, we want them dead.

SAM
Oh, that's funny; I remember that demon chick in Ohio, Casey? You didn't want her dead.

DEAN
Yeah, well she wasn't stringing me along like a fish on a hook.

SAM
No one's stringing me along! Look, I know it's dangerous, that she is dangerous, but like it or not, she's useful.

DEAN
No! We kill her before she kills us.

SAM
Kill her with what? The gun she fixed for us?

DEAN
Whatever works.

SAM
Dean, if she wants us dead, all she has to do is stop saving our lives.

DEAN turns away from SAM and goes to the sink turning on the water.

SAM
Look, we have to start looking at the big picture Dean, start thinking in strategies and – and moves ahead.

DEAN splashes water on his face.

SAM
It's not so simple, we're not – we're not just hunting anymore. We're at war.

DEAN turns off the water and looks at SAM in the mirror above the sink, grabs a towel to dry off his face and turns back around to SAM.

DEAN
Are you feeling okay?

SAM
(sigh) Why are you always asking me that?

SAM sits on the foot of one of the beds in the room, and DEAN moves back toward SAM.

DEAN
Because you're taking advice from a demon, for starters. And by the way, you seem less and less worried about offing people. You know, it used to eat you up inside.

SAM
Yeah, and what has that gotten me?

DEAN
Nothing, but it's just what you're supposed to do, okay? We're supposed to drive in the freakin' car and freakin' argue about this stuff. You know, you go on about the sanctity of life and all that crap. (DEAN rubs his stomach uncomfortably.)

SAM
Wait, so – so you're mad because I'm starting to agree with you? (DEAN looks at SAM and exhales.)

DEAN
No, I'm not mad, I'm— I'm— I'm worried, Sam— (DEAN moves and sits down on the foot of the other bed in the room.) I'm worried because you're not acting like yourself.

SAM
Yeah, you're right, I'm not. I don't have a choice.

DEAN
What is that supposed to mean?

SAM
Look, Dean, you're leaving – right? And I gotta stay here in this craphole of a world. Alone. So the way I see it, if I'm gonna make it, if I'm gonna fight this war after you're gone, then I gotta change.

DEAN has been looking increasingly uncomfortable during SAM's last speech, and is now clutching his stomach in discomfort and leaning forward slightly.

DEAN
Change into what?

SAM
Into you. I gotta be more like you.

DEAN shakes his head, then tightens his face in pain, and leans further over, still clutching his stomach and side with his left hand.

DEAN
Ah!

SAM
What's going on with you?

DEAN moves around in pain, still clutching his stomach, and he can barely force words out.

DEAN
I don't know. (bends, gasps) Oh— Sam something's wrong— bunch of knives inside of me—

SAM
Dean?

SAM Moves off the bed and kneels in front of DEAN who is now leaning all the way forward with his head almost between his legs.

DEAN
Son of a bitch—

SAM
Dean, hey.

DEAN
The coven man, it's gotta be the coven.

SAM
Don't worry.

SAM gets up and rushes into the bathroom opening the cupboards below the sink looking for the hex bag as DEAN yells in pain and lies back on the bed, his face still twisted in pain. SAM pulls things out of the cupboard throwing them aside.

DEAN leans forward again falling to his knees in front of the foot of the bed, spitting out blood, choking and sputtering. SAM is still looking for the hex bag, in another cupboard pulling out pillows and when he finds nothing, he moves to the bed while DEAN is still choking on blood and spitting it out of his mouth. SAM pulls off the covers to the bed tearing back the sheets and slices the mattress open with his knife and still cannot find the hex bag.

SAM
Dean, I can't find it.

DEAN falls over sideways and looks weak and hurt and still in pain.

SAM
No.

As DEAN continues to cough blood more weakly now, SAM rummages through his bag and pulls out the Colt and opens it to make sure there are bullets in it.

DEAN
Sam, what are you doing?

SAM gets up and moves toward the door.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM leaves closing the door behind him.

DEAN
Sam!

DEAN groans in pain.



EXT. ROAD – NIGHT
The IMPALA speed down a dark country road and the camera pans up to reveal SAM at the wheel with a look of determination on his face.



INT. VAN ALLEN HOUSE – NIGHT
ELIZABETH, RENEE AND TAMMI are around the coffee table again with the altar set up, chanting.

ELIZABETH, RENEE AND TAMMI
Kihér tolic echranmuk, madan fiéré, marc oh don duer kianave-

SAM kicks in the door and the women scream out of fear getting up from the altar raising their hands in surrender. SAM enters the room with the Colt drawn.

SAM
Let him go.

RENEE
Let who go? What are you doing? You're insane, get out!

SAM
Look, if you know about me, then you know about this gun. You're killing my brother. Now let him go. Get away from the altar.

RENEE
What?

SAM
Now!

They all move away from the altar with their hands still up as SAM keeps the Colt trained on them.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT
DEAN is leaning over a pool of blood he has spit out gasping and coughing blood still. There are quick footsteps outside and the door is kicked open and RUBY steps in and finds DEAN who looks up and sees her.

DEAN
You wanna kill me? Get in line bitch.

RUBY goes over to DEAN and pulls him up by the collar tossing him on the bed, leans over him and forces his mouth open with her left hand as DEAN tries to push her away. RUBY sprays a dark brown liquid into his mouth from a bag at her side with her right hand while Dean still struggles under her hold. RUBY stands up as DEAN chokes on the liquid and spits some back out.

RUBY (panting)
Stop ... calling me bitch.


INT. VAN ALLEN HOUSE – NIGHT

SAM is still aiming the gun at ELIZABETH, RENEE and TAMMI.

SAM
Go.

ELIZABETH, RENEE and TAMMI move over in front of the fireplace with their hands still up in the air.

ELIZABETH
What— we— we weren't hurting anyone.

RENEE
Please, we don't even know your brother.

SAM
Stop the spell, or die. Five seconds.

RENEE
What?

SAM cocks the gun and points it back at them.

SAM
Four.

RENEE
No, please, please don't kill us.

ELIZABETH
We were just getting Renee a lower mortgage rate!

SAM looks confused but still holds the gun ready.


INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT
RUBY
Next time you point that gun at me, I'm not gonna just disappear, understand?

RUBY tosses a sawed-off shotgun over to DEAN who is back to sitting on the foot of the bed. His face is somewhat cleaned off from the blood and liquid 'cure' that RUBY gave him.

DEAN
You ... saved my life.

RUBY
Don't mention it.

DEAN
What was that stuff? God, it was ass. It tasted like ass.

RUBY
It's called witchcraft, short bus.

RUBY turns and walks out of the room, closing the door behind her and leaving DEAN on the bed, slightly offended.

DEAN
You're the short bus ... short bus.



INT. HOUSE – NIGHT
SAM
Okay, maybe it's not you—

SAM points the gun at ELIZABETH.

SAM
—or you.

He points the gun at RENEE this time.

SAM
Maybe it's you.

SAM points the gun at TAMMI who sobs, upset and scared.

TAMMI
I don't even know what he's talking about. What a–re you even talking about?

SAM
I mean, all of you, everyone in your little coven, you've all had runs of good fortune. Newsworthy good fortune. Except for you, Tammi. Now tell me, why is that? You didn't want anything for yourself? Or is it because you're already getting what you wanted – like these women's souls.

TAMMI
I can't- I-I'm not- I-I-I don't...

TAMMI sighs and puts her hands down, going from looking frightened to calm and her eyes change to black revealing that she is the demon RUBY warned him about. The other women gasp, looking shocked.

TAMMI
Nice dick work, Magnum.

SAM
Let. My brother. Go.

TAMMI
What's wrong? Couldn't find my hex bag? Sorry, sweetheart, but your brother's lungs should be on the floor by now.

SAM shoots the Colt. The bullet slows as TAMMI lifts up her hand. The bullet loses momentum, slows, stops, and falls to the floor.

ELIZABETH gasps.

TAMMI
You're in a lot of trouble, Sam.

ACT FOUR
TAMMI motions her arm at SAM, and SAM is thrown against the wall behind him, and pinned there.

ELIZABETH
Tammi, what's wrong with your eyes?

TAMMI turns her head and attention on the other two women, making her eyes look human again. SAM is still pinned helplessly to the wall.

RENEE
Tammi, what are you doing?

TAMMI
Renee, shut your painted hole.

RENEE
What? I-I will— You can't— Not in my house, Tammi Fenton.

TAMMI, annoyed, waves her right hand at RENEE and RENEE's head snaps to the right so far it almost turns completely backwards, killing her instantly. Her body falls to the floor as ELIZABETH shrieks in terror, covering her mouth.

SAM
Look. You got me – let the girl go.

TAMMI
Wait your turn, young man.

ELIZABETH makes another scared noise (oh-oh god) bringing TAMMI's attention back to her.

TAMMI
Shhh, Lizzie, it's okay.

ELIZABETH
You're not Tammi.

TAMMI
No, but I'm wearing her meat. I had to break the ice with you girls somehow.

ELIZABETH
You killed Renee.

TAMMI
Renee, Amanda ... That's what happens to witches who get voted off the island.

ELIZABETH
Who are you?

TAMMI
Funny story, actually. You remember all those dark demonic forces you prayed to, when you swore your servitude? Just who did you think you were praying to?

ELIZABETH
This-this isn't – it can't b—

TAMMI
What did you think it was? Make-believe? Positive thinking? The Secret? No, it was me. You sold yourself to me, you pig.

ELIZABETH gasps and continues to stare at TAMMI in horror.

TAMMI
All I had to do was bring one good book to Book Club, and you ladies lined up to kiss my ass.

ELIZABETH
No, no, we didn't know—

TAMMI
Oh, yes you did. You knew every step of the way, and now your ever livin' souls are mine.

TAMMI turns back to SAM who is still pinned to the wall.

TAMMI
Comments? Questions? Hmm, Sammy Winchester, wow! Right here in our little town. You know, my friends and I, we've been looking for you.

SAM
Why? Oh, right, 'cause I'm supposed to lead some piss poor demon army.

TAMMI
No, not at all. You're not our Messiah. We don't believe in you. But, there's a new leader rising in the West – a real leader. That's the horse to bet on, Sam, the one who's gonna tear this world apart. Thing is, this demon? It doesn't like you very much. It doesn't want the competition.

TAMMI raises her hand and SAM slides up the wall, groaning, and is suspended against it.

TAMMI
Nothing personal, it's a P.R. thing, so, buh-bye.

TAMMI keeps her hand raised, and SAM begins to be crushed into the wall, paint and plaster cracking as he is pushed harder into the solid wall. Elizabeth stands there watching, frozen in fear and the front door to the house slams open. DEAN runs in with his shotgun drawn and TAMMI turns around, easily throwing him over the sofa, and when he gets up, she pins him to the wall behind him.

TAMMI
Two for one. Lovely.

RUBY's voice cuts in before TAMMI can finish what she started.

RUBY
Wait.

RUBY walks in with her hands raised in surrender.

RUBY (continues)
Please. I just ... came to talk.

RUBY puts her hands down.

TAMMI
You made it out of the gate. Impressive. That was a bitch of a fight, wasn't it?

RUBY
Doors out of Hell only open for so long.

TAMMI
What do you want, Ruby?

RUBY
I've been lost without you. (she continues to advance) Take me back. That's why I led the Winchesters here.

DEAN looks angry, and mouths "I told you so" to SAM.

RUBY (continuing)
They're for you ... as a gift.

TAMMI
Really.

RUBY
Let me serve you again. I've wanted it – I've wanted you – for so long. (DEAN lifts his eyebrows at this hot-demon-chick on hot-demon-chick flirtation.)

TAMMI
You were one of my best.

RUBY and TAMMI look at each other, and RUBY pulls her knife out and tries to stab TAMMI, but TAMMI catches it in mid-air.

TAMMI
But then again, you always were a lying whore.

The knife is thrown sideways out of their hands across the wood floor. TAMMI and RUBY fight, and TAMMI throws RUBY into the TV, but she gets up and kicks TAMMI and goes to run past her, and TAMMI clotheslines RUBY causing her to fall flat on her back. TAMMI pulls RUBY up and throws her into a bookcase and gets a fireplace poker from the stand on the hearth, looking at ELIZABETH who is still cowering from TAMMI, before she walks back to RUBY with the poker in her hand.

TAMMI
You're really telling me you threw in your chips with Abbott and Costello here?

RUBY, panting, tries to get up, and TAMMI hits her across the face with the fireplace poker. ELIZABETH runs to the altar and dumps a bunch of pins out of a bow onto the cloth with the demonic symbol on it. ELIZABETH is unseen by TAMMI, who is still paying attention to RUBY.

TAMMI
Come on. Get up.

RUBY is panting and not moving, with blood coming out of her nose.

TAMMI
I said, get up!

TAMMI tosses the poker aside and crouches over RUBY, grabbing her by the jacket and pulling her up.

TAMMI
We've been here before, haven't we?

TAMMI chuckles to herself and looks over at SAM.

TAMMI
She didn't tell you?

TAMMI turns back to Ruby and continues.

TAMMI (cotinues)
Pretty mortifying, I guess. She was one of mine. I turned her out a long, long time ago. Ruby here was a witch. Of course, that was when you were human.

DEAN and SAM both look surprised even though they are still both pinned to their respective walls. TAMMI throws RUBY back down onto the debris of the bookcase she crashed through and stands up.

TAMMI
Didn't want your friends to know that all those centuries back, you sold yourself to me? Embarrassing, I guess. But don't worry love, no secrets where you're heading remember?

TAMMI begins to chant and black smoke rises out of RUBY's mouth curling and hovering inches above her mouth.

TAMMI
Monyé valack forsa, ulu iri regatt ruac, fieesh nieesh forthsa lé inmist infirum forthsa por un betest a té un fornalles ecclaisee –

TAMMI begins to cough and ELIZABETH is chanting under her breath at the altar. As TAMMI coughs harder, DEAN is dropped from the wall and he falls forward. SAM also falls from the wall and drops to the floor as TAMMI brings her hand up to her mouth. TAMMI coughs up a handful of long pins into her hand, her mouth bleeding in the process. She looks at the pins and raises her right hand and clenches it into a fist. ELIZABETH'S breath catches and her eyes go wide as her heart stops and she falls onto the altar, dead.

DEAN comes up behind TAMMI and stabs her in the back repeatedly with RUBY's discarded knife. TAMMI dies as well as the demon that was inside of her and she falls to the floor. DEAN looks at RUBY and goes to help SAM up and they both move toward the door and stop to look at RUBY.

RUBY
Go.

RUBY looks at them, slightly embarrassed, and wipes the blood away from her mouth.

RUBY
I'll clean up this mess.

DEAN starts to walk toward the door, helping SAM on his way.

DEAN
Come on.

DEAN and SAM stop and look back at RUBY one more time. RUBY turns her eyes black and glares at them.

RUBY
Go.

DEAN and SAM walk out the door. RUBY leans over TAMMI's body, takes her knife out of TAMMI's back and holds it up. The knife is covered in blood, and is smoking.

ACT FIVE
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

SAM is splashing his face with water and looks in the mirror above the sink with a worried expression etched in his face.



EXT. MOTEL – NIGHT
Motel sign says: "Conquistador Motel"

DEAN is walking outside of the motel. As the lights flicker, he looks around, and then around again to see RUBY standing there in the shadows of the hotel parking lot.

DEAN
So the devil may care after all, is that what I'm supposed to believe?

RUBY
I don't believe in the devil.

DEAN walks toward her.

DEAN
Wacky night. So let me get this straight, you were human once, you died, you went to hell, you became a...

RUBY
Yeah.

RUBY turns to leave.

DEAN
How long ago?

RUBY
Back when the plague was big.

DEAN
So all of 'em – every damn demon – they were all human once?

RUBY
Every one I've ever met.

DEAN
Well, they sure don't act like it.

RUBY
Most of them have forgotten what it means, or even that they were. That's what happens when you go to Hell, Dean. That's what Hell is – forgetting what you are.

DEAN
Philosophy lesson from a demon. I'll pass, thanks.

RUBY
It's not philosophy. It's not a metaphor. There's a real fire in the pit. Agonies you can't even imagine.

DEAN
No, I saw "Hellraiser". I get the gist.

RUBY turns and starts walking away.

RUBY
Actually, they got that pretty close. Except for all the custom leather.

DEAN looks thoughtful and RUBY stops her departure, and turns back to DEAN.

RUBY
The answer is yes, by the way.

DEAN
I'm sorry?

RUBY
Yes, the same thing will happen to you. It might take centuries, but sooner or later Hell will burn away your humanity. Every Hell-bound soul, every one, turns into something else. Turns you into us. So yeah. Yeah, you can count on it.

DEAN
There's no way of saving me from the Pit, is there?

RUBY
(sighs) No.

DEAN
Then why'd you tell Sam that you could?

RUBY
So he would talk to me. You Winchesters can be pretty bigoted. I needed something to help him get past the–

DEAN
The demon thing? It's pretty hard to get past.

RUBY
(laughs) Look at you. Tryin' to be all stoic. My god, it's heartbreaking.

DEAN
Why are you telling me all this?

RUBY
I need your help.

DEAN
Help with what?

RUBY
With Sam. The way you stuck that demon tonight – it was pretty tough. Sam's almost there, but not quite. You need to help me get him ready – for life without you. To fight this war on his own.

RUBY turns and walks away again.

DEAN
Ruby! (She pauses) Why do you want us to win?

RUBY turns back around to face DEAN.

RUBY
Isn't it obvious? I'm not like them. I don't know why. I – I wish I was, but ... I'm not. I remember what it's like.

DEAN
What what's like?

RUBY
Being human.

DEAN looks down lost in his thoughts, and when he looks up RUBY has disappeared leaving DEAN alone in the parking lot.
