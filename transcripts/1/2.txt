Blackwater Ridge
Lost Creek, Colorado

EXT. FOREST – NIGHT

Two tents are set up near a fire ring. Crickets chirp. Inside one tent, two YOUNG MEN, BRAD and GARY, are playing head-to-head handheld video games.

BRAD
Dude, you're cheating.

GARY
No, you just suck.

Something growls outside. In the other tent, a third YOUNG MAN, TOM COLLINS, records a video message on his cell phone.

TOM
Hey Haley, day six, we're still out near Blackwater Ridge.

Something dark flicks behind the tent wall behind TOM, too fast to be identifiable as more than 'something dark'; the screen on TOM's phone, displaying the video as TOM records it, caught it.

TOM
We're fine, keeping safe, so don't worry, okay? Talk to you tomorrow.

TOM stops recording and sends the message.

BRAD closes his game system and tosses it aside. GARY stares at his system for a moment, then turns to look at BRAD, who is getting up and unzipping the tent.

GARY
Hey, where ya goin'? My moment of victory.

BRAD
Nature calls.

BRAD goes outside and zips up the tent behind him. He goes to stand against the tree to relieve himself. The fire crackles. Something snaps a stick. BRAD looks towards the sound and sees the trees rustling. BRAD shakes his head and returns his attention downward, then looks up sharply. Something growls.

Inside TOM's tent, TOM, who is reading Joseph Campbell's The Hero With A Thousand Faces, hears BRAD scream. Inside GARY's tent, GARY hears the same and rolls over.

GARY
Brad?

TOM sits up.

TOM
Gary, what's goin' on?

GARY opens the tent and sticks his head out to look around. He sees nothing. Growling. He looks up. Something pulls GARY out of the tent. He screams.

TOM turns out the lantern he had on. Shadows move very quickly around the outside of TOM's tent. TOM looks around, his eyes following the shadows and growling. Silence falls. Something slashes open TOM's tent. TOM screams.

ACT ONE
CEMETERY
Palo Alto, California

EXT. CEMETERY – DAY

Birds chirp. SAM, wearing a suit and tie and carrying a bouquet of various flowers excluding roses, walks through an otherwise deserted cemetery.

Starring
JARED PADALECKI

JENSEN ACKLES

SAM sighs and stops next to a gravestone. It reads "JESSICA LEE MOORE", "Beloved Daughter", "January 24th 1984 – November 2nd 2005". There is a small picture of a grinning JESS set into the stone above her name, a black-and-white picture of her leaning against the stone between a white teddy bear and a wooden box with a crucifix leaning on the picture, a small American flag next to the box, and three candles standing on the gravestone; one is of the Virgin de Guadalupe.

Guest Starring
CALLUM KEITH RENNIE

SAM looks between the gravestone and the flowers.

SAM
I, uh...

GINA HOLDEN

SAM laughs.

SAM
You always said roses were, were lame, so I brought you, uh...

ALDEN EHRENREICH

SAM looks at the picture set into the gravestone, then looks away, choking back tears. He steps closer to the gravestone.

SAM
Jess...oh God...

SAM kneels to set down the flowers.

Supervising Producer
PHIL SGRICCIA

SAM
I should have protected you. I should have told you the truth.

SAM leans the flowers in front of the crucifix. An arm covered in dirt shoots out of the ground and grabs SAM by the wrist.

IMPALA
INT. IMPALA – DAY

SAM jerks awake. It is 10 Nov 2005, he is riding shotgun next to DEAN, Foreigner's "Hot-Blooded" is playing, and the cemetery visit is days behind them if it ever occurred.

MUSIC
I'm hot-blooded, check it and see

SAM laughs.

DEAN
Just thought you might want to. Never mind.

MUSIC
Now you move so fine

SAM
Look, man, you're worried about me.

MUSIC
Let me lay it on the line

SAM
I get it, and thank you, but I'm perfectly okay.

SAM folds down the map, which is of Colorado and has a large red X labeled 35-111.

SAM
You know what?

MUSIC
Just me and you

SAM
Maybe we shouldn't have left Stanford so soon.

MUSIC
I'll show you lovin' like you never knew

DEAN
Sam, we dug around there for a week. We came up with nothing. If you wanna find the thing that killed Jessica—

Come on, baby, do you do more than dance?

DEAN
Dad will have answers. He'll know what to do.

SAM
It's weird, man.

MUSIC
I'm hot-blooded

SAM
These coordinates he left us.

MUSIC
Hot-blooded

SAM
This Blackwater Ridge.

DEAN
What about it?

SAM
There's nothing there. It's just woods.

SAM puts down the map.

SAM
Why is he sending us to the middle of nowhere?

They drive past the National Forest sign that says, "Welcome to LOST CREEK COLORADO National Forest".

RANGER STATION
EXT. RANGER STATION – DAY

The Impala is parked next to a sign that says "RANGER STATION Lost Creek Trail, Lost Creek National Forest".

SAM (voiceover)
So Blackwater Ridge is pretty remote.

INT. RANGER STATION – DAY

SAM looks at a 3D map of the national forest, paying particular attention to the ridge labeled "BLACKWATER RIDGE". DEAN looks at the decorations.

SAM
It's cut off by these canyons here, rough terrain, dense forest, abandoned silver and gold mines all over the place.

DEAN
Dude, check out the size of this freaking bear.

SAM looks over. DEAN is looking at a framed photo of a man standing behind a much larger bear. SAM comes to stand next to DEAN.

SAM
And a dozen or more grizzlies in the area. It's no nature hike, that's for sure.

A forest ranger, RANGER WILKINSON, walks up behind them; when he speaks, DEAN and SAM whip around, startled.

RANGER
You boys aren't planning on going out near Blackwater Ridge by any chance?

SAM
Oh, no, sir, we're environmental study majors from UC Boulder, just working on a paper.

SAM laughs a little. DEAN grins and raises a fist.

DEAN
Recycle, man.

RANGER
Bull.

SAM's eyes flick to DEAN, who doesn't move.

RANGER
You're friends with that Haley girl, right?

DEAN considers.

DEAN
Yes. Yes, we are, Ranger—

DEAN checks the RANGER's nametag.

DEAN
Wilkinson.

RANGER
Well I will tell you exactly what we told her. Her brother filled out a backcountry permit saying he wouldn't be back from Blackwater until the twenty-fourth, so it's not exactly a missing persons now, is it?

DEAN shakes his head.

RANGER
You tell that girl to quit worrying, I'm sure her brother's just fine.

DEAN
We will. Well that Haley girl's quite a pistol, huh?

RANGER
That is putting it mildly.

DEAN
Actually you know what would help is if I could show her a copy of that backcountry permit. You know, so she could see her brother's return date.

The RANGER eyes DEAN. DEAN raises his eyebrows.

EXT. RANGER STATION – DAY

DEAN and SAM leave the ranger station. DEAN is holding a piece of paper and laughing.

SAM
What, are you cruising for a hookup or something?

DEAN
What do you mean?

SAM
The coordinates point to Blackwater Ridge, so what are we waiting for? Let's just go find Dad. I mean, why even talk to this girl?

DEAN and SAM stop on opposite sides of the Impala.

DEAN
I don't know, maybe we should know what we're walking into before we actually walk into it?

A pause.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Since when are you all shoot first ask questions later, anyway?

SAM
Since now.

SAM turns away; the sound of the car door opening is heard.

DEAN
Really?

DEAN goes around the car.

COLLINS HOUSE
EXT. COLLINS HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and SAM are standing at the door to a house. The door opens to reveal HALEY COLLINS.

DEAN
You must be Haley Collins. I'm Dean, this is Sam, we're, ah, we're rangers with the Park Service. Ranger Wilkinson sent us over. He wanted us to ask a few questions about your brother Tommy.

HALEY hesitates.

HALEY
Lemme see some ID.

DEAN pulls out a fake ID with the name 'Samuel Cole' and holds it up against the screen. HALEY looks at it, then at DEAN, who smiles. HALEY opens the door.

HALEY
Come on in.

DEAN
Thanks.

The door swings open; HALEY catches sight of the Impala.

HALEY
That yours?

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM is looking back at the Impala.

HALEY
Nice car.

HALEY turns to lead DEAN and SAM into the kitchen, where BEN COLLINS is sitting at the table on a laptop. DEAN turns his head to mouth something to SAM, who rolls his eyes.

INT. KITCHEN – DAY

SAM
So if Tommy's not due back for a while, how do you know something's wrong?

HALEY comes back into the room with a bowl she places on the table.

HALEY
He checks in every day by cell. He emails, photos, stupid little videos—we haven't heard anything in over three days now.

SAM
Well, maybe he can't get cell reception.

HALEY
He's got a satellite phone, too.

DEAN
Could it be he's just having fun and forgot to check in?

BEN
He wouldn't do that.

DEAN eyes BEN. BEN looks away. HALEY puts more food on the table.

HALEY
Our parents are gone. It's just my two brothers and me. We all keep pretty close tabs on each other.

SAM
Can I see the pictures he sent you?

HALEY
Yeah.

On a laptop, HALEY pulls up pictures.

HALEY
That's Tommy.

HALEY clicks twice and another picture comes up, then the still frame opening the latest video.

TOM
Hey Haley, day six, we're still out near Blackwater Ridge. We're fine, keeping safe, so don't worry, okay? Talk to you tomorrow.

SAM spots the shadow flicking past.

DEAN
Well, we'll find your brother. We're heading out to Blackwater Ridge first thing.

HALEY
Then maybe I'll see you there. Look, I can't sit around here anymore. So I hired a guy. I'm heading out in the morning, and I'm gonna find Tommy myself.

DEAN
I think I know how you feel.

SAM
Hey, do you mind forwarding these to me?

HALEY
Sure.

BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

Someone breaks a game of pool. A waitress goes past carrying beer. SAM and DEAN sit down at a table.

SAM
So, Blackwater Ridge doesn't get a lot of traffic. Local campers, mostly. But still, this past April, two hikers went missing out there. They were never found.

SAM opens John's journal.

DEAN
Any before that?

SAM pulls out newspaper articles to show DEAN.

SAM
Yeah, in 1982, eight different people all vanished in the same year. Authorities said it was a grizzly attack.

DEAN reads the headline in The Lost Creek Gazette.

GRIZZLY BEAR ATTACKS!
UP TO EIGHT HIKERS VANISH IN LOST CREEK AREA
HIKERS DISAPPEARANCE BAFFLE AUTHORITIES'
Families continue search and rescue efforts in spite of disappointing [...]

SAM pulls out his laptop.

SAM
And again in 1959 and again before that in 1936.

SAM opens the laptop, which already has a window open to TOM's video.

SAM
Every twenty-three years, just like clockwork. Okay. Watch this. Here's a clincher. I downloaded that guy Tommy's video to the laptop. Check this out.

SAM pulls up the video and goes through three frames of the video one at a time. A shadow crosses the screen.

DEAN
Do it again.

SAM repeats the frames.

SAM
That's three frames. That's a fraction of a second. Whatever that thing is, it can move.

DEAN hits SAM. SAM looks up.

DEAN
Told you something weird was going on.

SAM
Yeah.

SAM closes the laptop.

SAM
I got one more thing.

SAM hands over another newspaper article.

SAM
In 'fifty-nine one camper survived this supposed grizzly attack. Just a kid. Barely crawled out of the woods alive.

DEAN looks at The Lost Creek Gazette.

DEAN
Is there a name?

SHAW HOUSE
INT. HOUSE – NIGHT

An OLD MAN, MR. SHAW, talks to SAM and DEAN while leading them inside his house. SHAW has a cigarette in his mouth.

SHAW
Look, ranger, I don't know why you're asking me about this. It's public record. I was a kid. My parents got mauled by a—

SAM interrupts.

SAM
Grizzly? That's what attacked them?

SHAW takes a puff of his cigarette, takes it out, and nods.

DEAN
The other people that went missing that year, those bear attacks too?

A pause.

DEAN
What about all the people that went missing this year? Same thing?

A pause.

DEAN
We knew what we were dealing with, we might be able to stop it.

SHAW
I seriously doubt that. Anyways, I don't see what difference it would make.

SHAW sits down.

SHAW
You wouldn't believe me. Nobody ever did.

SAM sits down across from SHAW.

SAM
Mr. Shaw, what did you see?

SHAW pauses.

SHAW
Nothing. It moved too fast to see. It hid too well. I heard it, though. A roar. Like...no man or animal I ever heard.

SAM
It came at night?

SHAW nods.

SAM
Got inside your tent?

SHAW
It got inside our cabin. I was sleeping in front of the fireplace when it came in. It didn't smash a window or break the door. It unlocked it. Do you know of a bear that could do something like that? I didn't even wake up till I heard my parents screaming.

SAM
It killed them?

SHAW
Dragged them off into the night.

SHAW shakes his head.

SHAW
Why it left me alive...been asking myself that ever since.

A pause. SHAW's hands go to his collar.

SHAW
Did leave me this, though.

SHAW opens his collar to reveal three long scars. Claw marks. SAM and DEAN look at them.

SHAW
There's something evil in those woods. It was some sort of a demon.

LATER
INT. MOTEL? – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM walk the length of a corridor with rooms on either side.

DEAN
Spirits and demons don't have to unlock doors. If they want inside, they just go through the walls.

SAM
So it's probably something else, something corporeal.

DEAN
Corporeal? Excuse me, professor.

SAM
Shut up. So what do you think?

DEAN
The claws, the speed that it moves...could be a skinwalker, maybe a black dog. Whatever we're talking about, we're talking about a creature, and it's corporeal. Which means we can kill it.

EXT. PARKING LOT – NIGHT

DEAN opens the trunk of the Impala, then the weapons box, and props it open with a shotgun. He puts some guns in a duffel bag. SAM leans in.

SAM
We cannot let that Haley girl go out there.

DEAN
Oh yeah? What are we gonna tell her? That she can't go into the woods because of a big scary monster?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN looks at SAM.

DEAN
Her brother's missing, Sam. She's not gonna just sit this out. Now we go with her, we protect her, and we keep our eyes peeled for our fuzzy predator friend.

DEAN picks up the duffel.

SAM
Finding Dad's not enough?

SAM slams the weapons box shut, then the trunk.

SAM
Now we gotta babysit too?

DEAN stares at SAM.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Nothing.

He throws the duffel bag at SAM and walks off. SAM stares after him.

FOREST
EXT. FOREST – DAY

A MAN, ROY, talks to HALEY (who is wearing shorts) and BEN while checking a shotgun. They're all carrying full backpacks.

ROY
I'll tell you again, I don't think Ben should come.

HALEY
Roy—

ROY
Look, you're paying me good money to keep everybody safe. I think Ben's safest at home.

The Impala pulls up. ROY, HALEY, and BEN stare. HALEY shakes her head. SAM and DEAN get out of the car. SAM opens the back door of the Impala and pulls out the duffel bag.

DEAN
You guys got room for two more?

HALEY
Wait, you want to come with us?

ROY
Who are these guys?

HALEY
Apparently this is all the park service could muster up for the search and rescue.

SAM heads past everyone.

ROY
You're rangers?

DEAN
That's right.

HALEY
And you're hiking out in biker boots and jeans?

DEAN looks down at himself.

DEAN
Well, sweetheart, I don't do shorts.

DEAN heads past HALEY.

ROY
What, you think this is funny? It's dangerous back country out there. Her brother might be hurt.

SAM turns back.

DEAN
Believe me, I know how dangerous it can be. We just wanna help them find their brother, that's all.

DEAN heads past SAM.

MINE
INT. MINE – DAY

A mine shaft lets in light. TOM and GARY are hanging by their wrists from the ceiling. There are assorted corpses with them. Growling. GARY spots a tall skinny shape and starts yelling. TOMMY does his best to turn away and does close his eyes tightly as GARY yells.

ACT TWO
FOREST
EXT. FOREST – DAY

The group hikes through the forest, ROY in the lead, then DEAN, HALEY, BEN, and SAM bringing up the rear.

DEAN
Roy, you said you did a little hunting.

ROY
Yeah, more than a little.

DEAN
Uh-huh. What kind of furry critters do you hunt?

ROY
Mostly buck, sometimes bear.

DEAN passes ROY.

DEAN
Tell me, uh, Bambi or Yogi ever hunt you back?

ROY grabs DEAN. SAM looks on.

DEAN
Whatcha doing, Roy?

ROY grabs a stick and pokes the bear trap DEAN had almost stepped in. HALEY looks annoyed.

ROY
You should watch where you're stepping. Ranger.

ROY drops the stick and retakes the lead.

DEAN
It's a bear trap.

They hike on. HALEY catches up to DEAN.

HALEY
You didn't pack any provisions. You guys are carrying a duffel bag. You're not rangers.

HALEY grabs DEAN's arm.

HALEY
So who the hell are you?

BEN goes past HALEY and DEAN. SAM looks at DEAN, who indicates with his expression that SAM's to go on by; SAM obeys. DEAN watches him go for a moment.

DEAN
Sam and I are brothers, and we're looking for our father. He might be here, we don't know. I just figured that you and me, we're in the same boat.

HALEY
Why didn't you just tell me that from the start?

DEAN
I'm telling you now. 'sides, it's probably the most honest I've ever been with a woman. ...ever. So we okay?

A pause.

HALEY
Yeah, okay.

DEAN
And what do you mean I didn't pack provisions?

DEAN pulls out a big bag of peanut M&Ms and sticks his hand in the bag as he hikes on. HALEY waits a moment, then follows.

LATER
EXT. FOREST – DAY

ROY leads the way, followed by SAM, BEN, HALEY, and DEAN.

ROY
This is it. Blackwater Ridge.

SAM heads past ROY.

SAM
What coordinates are we at?

ROY pulls out a GPS, which reads N 35o 45.383, W 111o 00.55.

ROY
Thirty-five and minus one-eleven.

DEAN comes up to SAM. They listen.

DEAN
You hear that?

SAM
Yeah. Not even crickets.

ROY
I'm gonna go take a look around.

SAM
You shouldn't go off by yourself.

ROY
That's sweet. Don't worry about me.

ROY waves his gun and pushes between DEAN and SAM to retake the lead. DEAN turns back to the others as BEN and HALEY catch up.

DEAN
All right, everybody stays together. Let's go.

CAMPSITE
EXT. FOREST – DAY

SAM, DEAN, BEN, and HALEY are looking around near a large rock.

ROY
Haley! Over here!

HALEY runs towards ROY's voice, followed closely by the others. They come to a halt.

HALEY
Oh my God.

The tents are torn open and bloody and all the supplies are scattered.

ROY
Looks like a grizzly.

DEAN and HALEY look around.

HALEY
Tommy?

HALEY takes off her backpack and goes through the campsite.

HALEY
Tommy!

SAM moves to catch up with HALEY.

SAM
Shh.

HALEY
Tommy!

SAM
Shh-hh-hh!

HALEY
Why?

SAM
Something might still be out there.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM goes over to DEAN, snapping a stick, and crouches next to him.

DEAN
The bodies were dragged from the campsite. But here, the tracks just vanish. That's weird.

DEAN and SAM stand up.

DEAN
I'll tell you what, that's no skinwalker or black dog.

DEAN goes back to the campsite and SAM follows. HALEY picks up TOM's cell phone; it's bloody. She cries. She turns the phone over and the back is open. DEAN crouches next to her.

DEAN
Hey, he could still be alive.

HALEY gives DEAN a Look.

SOMEONE
Help! Help!

ROY leads the way as everyone runs to the aid of the shouter.

SOMEONE
Help! Somebody!

They find no one.

HALEY
It seemed like it was coming from around here, didn't it?

They listen.

SAM
Everybody back to camp.

Back at the campsite, all the supplies are missing.

HALEY
Our packs!

ROY
So much for my GPS and my satellite phone.

HALEY
What the hell is going on?

SAM
It's smart. It wants to cut us off so we can't call for help.

ROY
You mean someone, some nutjob out there just stole all our gear.

SAM goes to DEAN.

SAM
I need to speak with you. In private.

SAM and DEAN head a little ways away from the group.

SAM
Good. Let me see Dad's journal.

DEAN hands it over. SAM opens it and flips through until he finds a particular page.

SAM
All right, check that out.

SAM points to a First Nations–style drawing of a figure.

DEAN
Oh come on, wendigos are in the Minnesota woods or, or northern Michigan. I've never even heard of one this far west.

SAM
Think about it, Dean, the claws, the way it can mimic a human voice.

DEAN
Great.

DEAN takes out his pistol.

DEAN
Well then this is useless.

SAM gives DEAN back John's journal and heads past DEAN, stopping for a moment.

SAM
We gotta get these people to safety.

Back at the campsite, SAM addresses the group.

SAM
All right, listen up, it's time to go. Things have gotten...more complicated.

HALEY
What?

ROY
Kid, don't worry. Whatever's out there, I think I can handle it.

SAM
It's not me I'm worried about. If you shoot this thing, you're just gonna make it mad. We have to leave. Now.

ROY
One, you're talking nonsense. Two, you're in no position to give anybody orders.

DEAN
Relax.

SAM
We never should have let you come out here in the first place, all right? I'm trying to protect you.

ROY steps right into SAM's space.

ROY
You protect me? I was hunting these woods when your mommy was still kissing you good night.

SAM
Yeah? It's a damn near perfect hunter. It's smarter than you, and it's gonna hunt you down and eat you alive unless we get your stupid sorry ass out of here.

ROY laughs.

ROY
You know you're crazy, right?

SAM
Yeah? You ever hunt a wen—

DEAN pushes SAM.

HALEY
Roy!

DEAN

DEAN
Chill out.

HALEY
Stop. Stop it. Everybody just stop. Look. Tommy might still be alive. And I'm not leaving here without him.

A long pause.

DEAN
It's getting late. This thing is a good hunter in the day, but an unbelievable hunter at night. We'll never beat it, not in the dark. We need to settle in and protect ourselves.

HALEY
How?

ACT THREE
CAMPSITE
EXT. FOREST – NIGHT

The group has built a campfire, and DEAN draws something in the dirt around the campsite while HALEY pokes at the fire.

HALEY
One more time, that's—

DEAN
Anasazi symbols. It's for protection. The wendigo can't cross over them.

ROY laughs, gun over his shoulder.

DEAN
Nobody likes a skeptic, Roy.

DEAN heads over to sit next to SAM, who is at the edge of the campsite.

DEAN
You wanna tell me what's going on in that freaky head of yours?

SAM
Dean—

DEAN
No, you're not fine. You're like a powder keg, man, it's not like you. I'm supposed to be the belligerent one, remember?

A pause.

SAM
Dad's not here. I mean, that much we know for sure, right? He would have left us a message, a sign, right?

DEAN
Yeah, you're probably right. Tell you the truth, I don't think Dad's ever been to Lost Creek.

SAM
Then let's get these people back to town and let's hit the road. Go find Dad. I mean, why are we still even here?

DEAN
This is why.

DEAN comes around to SAM's front and holds up John's journal.

DEAN
This book. This is Dad's single most valuable possession—everything he knows about every evil thing is in here. And he's passed it on to us. I think he wants us to pick up where he left off. You know, saving people, hunting things. The family business.

SAM shakes his head.

SAM
That makes no sense. Why doesn't he just—call us? Why doesn't he—tell us what he wants, tell us where he is?

DEAN
I dunno. But the way I see it, Dad's giving us a job to do, and I intend to do it.

SAM
Dean...no. I gotta find Dad. I gotta find Jessica's killer. It's the only thing I can think about.

DEAN
Okay, all right, Sam, we'll find them, I promise. Listen to me. You've gotta prepare yourself. I mean, this search could take a while, and all that anger, you can't keep it burning over the long haul. It's gonna kill you. You gotta have patience, man.

SAM looks down, then up.

SAM
How do you do it? How does Dad do it?

DEAN looks over at HALEY and BEN.

DEAN
Well for one, them.

SAM looks over at HALEY and BEN.

DEAN
I mean, I figure our family's so screwed to hell, maybe we can help some others. Makes things a little bit more bearable.

A pause.

DEAN
I'll tell you what else helps.

SAM looks back at DEAN.

DEAN
Killing as many evil sons of bitches as I possibly can.

SAM smiles. A twig snaps.

SOMEONE, presumably the WENDIGO
Help me! Please!

DEAN stands and readies his gun.

WENDIGO
Help!

SAM shines a flashlight about.

DEAN
He's trying to draw us out. Just stay cool, stay put.

ROY
Inside the magic circle?

WENDIGO
Help! Help me!

Growling.

ROY points his gun at the sound.

ROY
Okay, that's no grizzly.

HALEY talks to BEN.

HALEY
It's okay. You'll be all right, I promise.

Something rushes past. HALEY shrieks.

SAM
It's here.

ROY shoots at the rustling, then again.

ROY
I hit it!

ROY goes to see what he hit.

DEAN
Roy, no! Roy!

DEAN turns to HALEY and BEN.

DEAN
Don't move.

HALEY's holding a stick, burning at one end, as a weapon. DEAN and SAM run after ROY.

ROY
It's over here! It's in the tree!

The WENDIGO reaches down from the tree and snaps ROY's neck.

DEAN
Roy!

SAM shines the flashlight around, then directly into the camera.

ACT FOUR
CAMPSITE
EXT. FOREST – DAY

SAM is sitting against a hollow tree stump, holding John's journal and playing with a lanyard attached to same. DEAN and HALEY and BEN are among the tents.

HALEY
I don't...I mean, these types of things, they aren't supposed to be real.

DEAN
I wish I could tell you different.

HALEY
How do we know it's not out there watching us?

DEAN
We don't. But we're safe for now.

HALEY
How do you know about this stuff?

A pause while DEAN considers.

DEAN
Kind of runs in the family.

SAM comes over.

SAM
Hey.

HALEY stands up.

SAM
So we've got half a chance in the daylight. And I for one want to kill this evil son of a bitch.

DEAN
Well, hell, you know I'm in.

SAM shows the wendigo page of John's journal to HALEY and BEN.

SAM
'Wendigo' is a Cree Indian word. It means 'evil that devours'.

DEAN
They're hundreds of years old. Each one was once a man. Sometimes an Indian, or other times a frontiersman or a miner or hunter.

HALEY
How's a man turn into one of those things?

DEAN picks a couple things up off the ground.

DEAN
Well, it's always the same. During some harsh winter a guy finds himself starving, cut off from supplies or help. Becomes a cannibal to survive, eating other members of his tribe or camp.

BEN
Like the Donner Party.

SAM
Cultures all over the world believe that eating human flesh gives a person certain abilities. Speed, strength, immortality.

DEAN
If you eat enough of it, over years, you become this less than human thing. You're always hungry.

HALEY
So if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive?

DEAN
You're not gonna like it.

DEAN glances at SAM, then back to HALEY.

HALEY
Tell me.

DEAN
More than anything, a wendigo knows how to last long winters without food. It hibernates for years at a time, but when it's awake it keeps its victims alive. It, uh, it stores them, so it can feed whenever it wants. If your brother's alive, it's keeping him somewhere dark, hidden, and safe. We gotta track it back there.

HALEY
And then how do we stop it?

DEAN
Well, guns are useless, so are knives. Basically—

DEAN holds up the can of lighter fluid, the beer bottle, and the white cloth he'd picked up.

DEAN
We gotta torch the sucker.

FOREST
EXT. FOREST – DAY

DEAN leads the way through the woods, Molotov cocktail in hand. HALEY follows, then BEN, then SAM. They pass trees with claw marks and blood.

EXT. FOREST – DAY, LATER

SAM is leading the group now.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN catches up.

DEAN
What is it?

SAM and DEAN look around at the trees. There are bloody claw marks and broken branches everywhere.

SAM
You know, I was thinking, those claw prints, so clear and distinct. They were almost too easy to follow.

Growling. SAM and DEAN whip around. Trees rustle.

HALEY is standing under a tree. Blood drips on her shirt. She notices and looks up, then leaps out of the way; ROY's corpse lands where she'd stood.

DEAN examines ROY as SAM goes over to HALEY.

SAM
You okay? You got it?

DEAN
His neck's broke.

SAM helps HALEY up. More growling.

DEAN
Okay, run, run, run, run, go, go, go!

Everybody takes off.

BEN falls and SAM hurries back to help him up, dividing the group two and two.

SAM
Come on, I gotcha, I gotcha.

DEAN and HALEY stop short: the wendigo is in front of them. HALEY screams.

BEN
Haley?

SAM stops running and picks up Dean's Molotov cocktail, the bottle broken.

SAM
Dean!

ACT FIVE
FOREST
EXT. FOREST – DAY

BEN
If it keeps its victims alive, why would it kill Roy?

SAM
Honestly? I think because Roy shot at it, pissed it off.

BEN finds a trail of peanut M&Ms and picks one up.

BEN
They went this way.

SAM catches up to BEN, who hands over the M&M. SAM laughs.

SAM
It's better than breadcrumbs.

SAM tosses the M&M away.

SAM and BEN follow the trail. They come to a mine entrance marked with a sign that says WARNING! DANGER! DO NOT ENTER EXTREMELY TOXIC MATERIAL. SAM looks at BEN, shrugs, and goes inside. BEN follows. Above the entrance is a larger sign that says KEEP OUT NO ADMITTANCE.

MINE
INT. MINE – DAY

SAM shines the flashlight ahead of them. Growling; SAM shuts off the light and pulls BEN against the wall. The WENDIGO comes towards them. SAM covers BEN's mouth before he can scream. The WENDIGO takes a different tunnel at the crossing. SAM and BEN keep going. The floorboards creak and BEN and SAM fall through the floor; they land in a pile of bones. There is another pile nearby of skulls. BEN spots them and leaps backward.

SAM
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

SAM and BEN look up; DEAN and HALEY are hanging by their wrists from the ceiling. SAM runs to DEAN, BEN to HALEY.

SAM
Dean!

BEN
Haley, wake up!

SAM grabs DEAN and shakes him.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN opens his eyes.

SAM
Hey, you okay?

DEAN winces.

DEAN
Yeah.

BEN
Haley, Haley, wake up, wake up!

SAM cuts DEAN down and BEN takes care of HALEY. They help them over to an empty patch of floor and get them sat down. DEAN makes pained noises.

SAM
You sure you're all right?

DEAN grimaces.

DEAN
Yeah. Yep. Where is he?

SAM
He's gone for now.

HALEY divests herself of rope. She stands up and spots TOM still hanging and starts crying.

HALEY
Tommy...

HALEY touches TOM's cheek. TOM's head jerks up. HALEY jumps back and shrieks. She turns to SAM.

HALEY
Cut him down!

SAM cuts TOM down.

HALEY
We're gonna get you home.

The stolen supplies are piled in the corner. DEAN picks up flare guns.

DEAN
Check it out.

SAM
Flare guns. Those'll work.

SAM grins. DEAN laughs and twirls the guns.

They head down a tunnel, DEAN and SAM in the lead with the flare guns and HALEY and BEN supporting TOM, who is limping.

Growling.

DEAN
Looks like someone's home for supper.

HALEY
We'll never outrun it.

DEAN looks back at the others.

DEAN
You thinking what I'm thinking?

SAM
Yeah, I think so.

DEAN
All right, listen to me. Stay with Sam. He's gonna get you out of here.

HALEY
What are you gonna do?

DEAN winks and starts walking and yelling.

DEAN
Chow time, you freaky bastard! Yeah, that's right, bring it on, baby, I taste good.

The rest of DEAN's words are indistinct.

SAM waits until DEAN is a safe distance away.

SAM
All right, come on! Hurry!

The Collinses follow SAM down the tunnel.

INT. MINE – DAY

DEAN
Hey, you want some white meat, bitch! I'm right here!

INT. MINE – DAY

SAM, HALEY, BEN, and TOM hurry down a tunnel.

Growling. SAM points the gun at it, then lowers the gun and turns to the Collinses.

SAM
Get him outta here.

HALEY
Sam, no.

SAM
Go! Go! Go!

BEN
Come on, Haley!

HALEY and BEN help TOM along the mine tunnel.

SAM holds the flare gun ready to shoot, looking down the tunnel.

SAM
Come on. Come on.

Growling. SAM turns: the WENDIGO is right in his face. SAM shoots and misses, then runs after the Collinses.

HALEY
Sam!

SAM catches up.

SAM
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry.

They run to the end of the tunnel, the WENDIGO right behind.

SAM
Get behind me.

SAM is large enough to hide all three Collinses.

The WENDIGO approaches, taking its time.

DEAN comes up behind the WENDIGO.

DEAN
Hey!

The WENDIGO turns. DEAN shoots it in the stomach. The flare goes off and the WENDIGO goes up in flames.

DEAN
Not bad, huh?

SAM grins.

EPILOGUE
EXT. RANGER STATION – NIGHT

An ambulance loads up TOM. Two POLICE OFFICERS interview BEN; SAM stands behind BEN.

OFFICER
And the bear came back again after you yelled at it?

BEN
That's when it circled the campsite. I mean, this grizzly must have weighed eight hundred, nine hundred pounds.

SAM nods.

OFFICER
All right, we'll go after it first thing.

HALEY talks to DEAN; both have already been patched up.

HALEY
So I don't know how to thank you.

DEAN smirks lasciviously. HALEY smiles despite herself.

HALEY
Must you cheapen the moment?

DEAN
Yeah.

A PARAMEDIC comes up to HALEY.

PARAMEDIC
You riding with your brother?

HALEY
Yeah.

The PARAMEDIC heads back to the ambulance. HALEY turns to BEN.

HALEY
Let's go.

SAM and BEN nod at each other. HALEY kisses DEAN on the cheek.

HALEY
I hope you find your father.

HALEY and BEN head for the ambulance.

HALEY
Thanks, Sam.

HALEY and BEN climb in the ambulance with TOM, who is shirtless and bandaged.

SAM sits on the Impala's hood with DEAN.

PARAMEDIC 2
Close her up.

A third PARAMEDIC closes the ambulance doors.

DEAN
Man, I hate camping.

SAM
Me too.

Noises of the ambulance driving away, sirens on.

DEAN
Sam, you know we're gonna find Dad, right?

SAM
Yeah, I know. But in the meantime? I'm driving.

DEAN tosses SAM the keys.

"Fly By Night" by Rush begins to play.

SAM and DEAN get in the car, slamming the doors almost in sync.

MUSIC
Why try? I know why

The car starts and drives off.

EXT. ROAD – DAY

The Impala drives along.

MUSIC
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
