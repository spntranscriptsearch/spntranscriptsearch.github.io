TEASER
[The episode opens with SAM and DEAN in the Bunker. They are in the library. SAM is researching Cain and Abel on the computer and DEAN is pacing looking like he is calling CROWLEY for the thousandth time.]


DEAN [into the phone]

Come on, Crowley. Pick up! Where the hell is he? It's not like he's got a social life.


SAM [looking up from the computer]

Uh, are you actually worried?


[DEAN gets CROWLEY's voicemail.]


CROWLEY's message

Too busy inflicting pain to answer. Leave a message.


DEAN [annoyed]

Guy's got one job -- find the First Blade, bring it back. How hard is that?


SAM

It's Crowley. He's not exactly a team player.


DEAN

Yeah, but his ass is on the line, too. He goes missing for weeks on end without a peep? Well, not one that makes sense, anyway. Listen to this.


[DEAN sets his phone on the table and plays a voicemail on speaker]


CROWLEY

Dean. Um... [indecipherable ramblings]


SAM

Wait a second. Did he...Drunk-dial you?


DEAN [calling CROWLEY's phone again]

Come on.


[CROWLEY's phone rings as the scene changes. CROWLEY's caller ID reads "Not Moose" The camera pans across clothes scattered on the floor to CROWLEY in bed with a young, gorgeous woman. They are both breathing hard and then we see CROWLEY fall on his back on the pillow.]


CROWLEY

Lola?


LOLA

My King?


CROWLEY

My après-consummation treat.


LOLA

On it, sire.


[LOLA move to the closet and opens the door to reveal a man tied and hanging from the hanger rod. LOLA pulls out a syringe and sticks the needle in his neck and fills it with his blood. The man struggles weakly and then passes out. LOLA turns back to CROWLEY]


LOLA [handing the syringe to him]

Pantry's almost empty. We'll need another volunteer.


CROWLEY

You should add that to your "to do" list.


[CROWLEY pressed the needle into his arm and shoots up all the human blood]


CROWLEY

Ahh.

Lola, pet? I do believe I'm ravenous.


[LOLA does a small bow and leaves.]


[Later LOLA returns with pizza and wine. She sees CROWLEY watching Casablanca and crying openly. She smirks to herself as she watches CROWLEY wipe his eyes]


TITLE CARD


ACT ONE
[Scene begins in a shipping warehouse. LOLA is waiting for someone. A stunt demon walks up to her and she looks up.]


ALDO

My name is Aldo.


LOLA

My intel is for Abaddon...Minion.


ALDO

And she appreciates the work you've been doing.


LOLA

At great peril.


ALDO

But she is tied up securing her place as new leader of the Kingdom. She assures you that all relevant information can be conveyed to me. So...Update?


LOLA

The King is off his game. Except for sex, pizza, and human blood, he has no interests. He can't function without me.


ALDO

Well played.


LOLA

I should mention he keeps getting phone calls from those Winchesters. They leave voicemails for him.


ALDO

Saying?


LOLA

Mostly, they're rude. One mentioned something called the First Blade.


ALDO

Interesting. Follow how this develops and report in.


LOLA

Oh, I will. And when I do, I expect to report directly to the next Queen of Hell. Capisce?


[Scene changes to SAM, DEAN and the IMPALA at a crossroads and SAM is busy burying a container of ritual items while DEAN finishes spray-painting a giant Devil's Trap.]


DEAN

All right, do it.


SAM

Daemon, esto subiecto voluntati meae.


[They look around as SNOOKI appears behind them in the Devil's Trap.]


SNOOKI [with red eyes]

Winchesters.


SAM [startled]

I-is that, uh...?


DEAN

Well, that explains a lot.


SAM

Okay, uh, look...Snooki -- can I call you "Snooki"?


SNOOKI

No. It's Nicole now.


SAM

Okay, then. Nicole... We can do this one of two ways. The easy way -- you talk. Or the easier way -- [he takes out Ruby's knife] you still talk.


DEAN

I vote for number two.


SAM

We just want some basic information on Crowley. That's it.


SNOOKI

Google him. Are we done? [SAM advances at her with the knife raised] Whoa! Not the face! Are you crazy? Listen, guys, what happens in Hell stays in Hell. I got nothin'.


DEAN

But you do have a pretty sweet deal with Crowley in charge. If Abaddon wins, you can kiss all that goodbye --


SAM

all the fancy cars, the book deals.


DEAN

Show biz can be tough.


SNOOKI

I'm doing fine. Thanks.


DEAN

Oh. Well, good luck landing your next gig inside a Devil's Trap.


SNOOKI [sighing]

What do you want to know?


SAM

Where is Crowley?


SNOOKI

Last time I heard, he was somewhere in the western Pacific.


SAM

Makes sense.


SNOOKI

Really? Floating around in the ocean while his kingdom goes up in flames?


DEAN

Meaning?


SNOOKI

Hell's gettin' crazy. Even the loyalists want to sign on with Abaddon. She's gonna make her move. Are we done? I got a thing.


[SAM and DEAN exchange looks]


SAM

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus...


SNOOKI

Seriously? An exorcism? We had a deal!


DEAN

See ya, Snooks.


[SAM continues the exorcism, much to SNOOKI's dismay.]


[Scene changes to CROWLEY's room. LOLA walks in the door with a handful of shopping bags.]


LOLA

Honey, I'm home.


CROWLEY

Hello, pumpkin. Did you have a nice day?


LOLA

Lola did some shopping.


CROWLEY

Looks like Lola did a lot of shopping.


LOLA

But not all of it's for me. Looky, looky.


[She pulls out a blood bag filled with O Negitive]


CROWLEY

I hope it's a good vintage.


LOLA

Well, you look like you could use a little pick-me-up. I just love what it does for you.


CROWLEY

Do you?


[CROWLEY flicks his hand and sends LOLA flying into the next room and hitting the floor at the foot of the bed]


CROWLEY

You tried to play me? I play the tune! Everyone else dances to it. Got it?


LOLA

Yes! I -- I'm your slave.


CROWLEY

You're my rodent -- my little rodent who went scurrying off to Abaddon to rat on me.


LOLA

No! No.


CROWLEY

Do you really think some other lowlife wouldn't sell you out? I thought you were a smart girl -- a girl I could've helped.


LOLA

You're joking, right? You help me? Look at yourself. You couldn't help anyone.


CROWLEY

Hmm.


[He drops an angel blade into his hand from his sleeve and stabs and kills LOLA. He walks into the other room and shoots up another syringe of blood. Then he catches a look at himself in the mirror. He gets emotional as he takes in his bloodshot eyes and unkempt look.]

ACT TWO
[SAM is in the Bunker library reading a entry on the computer about the Mariana Trench. DEAN enters]


SAM

Hey. So...Cain said the First Blade was tossed in the deepest ocean, right? That's the Mariana Trench. Maybe Crowley found it, and it's a double-cross.


DEAN

That doesn't make sense. He wants me to power it up and kill the ginger. He set it up.


SAM

Okay. A-assuming he does show up with it, Crowley is only useful to us until we have the Blade.


DEAN

Yeah. So?


SAM

So...There's nothing stopping us from using it on him, right?


DEAN

Nothing at all.

[DEAN's phone rings and he looks at the caller ID]

Speak of the devil.

[he answers]

Did you find the First Blade?


CROWLEY

Not exactly.


DEAN

Well, then, what, exactly?


CROWLEY

I'm in... a jam of sorts. Thought you might help.


[The IMPALA cruses down the road. CROWLEY unlocks his door and enters, carrying a paper bag with something inside it. He starts when he sees SAM and DEAN already inside.]


CROWLEY

Hello, boys.


DEAN [kicking a foot of a dead body on the floor]

And what do you call this?


CROWLEY

Refreshments?


SAM

What's in the bag, Crowley?


CROWLEY

Nothing.


SAM

Really? Maybe I can, uh...

[SAM reaches for the bag and tears it open revealing a blood bag filled with AB Negitive]

What, are you knocking over blood banks?


[SAM grabs CROWLEY's arm and DEAN swings a chair around. They shove him into the chair and handcuff him to the arm.]


CROWLEY

Come on, guys.


DEAN

Look at you. You're a mess. You know, we were counting on you. You let us down.


SAM

Your slimy followers were counting on you to kill Abaddon, and you let them down.


DEAN

The man with all the mojo -- Captain Evil.


SAM

Oh, it's pathetic.


CROWLEY

What is this? An intervention?


SAM

You need to focus, Crowley. Get a grip!


DEAN

What, you just gonna let Hell go to Hell?


CROWLEY

You don't know what it's like to be human!


[DEAN just stares at him]


CROWLEY

It's your DNA. It's my addiction, my cross, my burden!


DEAN

All right, take it easy.


CROWLEY

I see the darkness of it now, the Anthony Weiner of it. It makes you needy. I needed her. Lola used me. She reported everything I did back to Abaddon.


SAM

Crowley... Did you tell her about the First Blade?


CROWLEY

I don't know. Things get a trifle blurry when I'm medicated.


SAM

Great. If he told Lola, she definitely told Abaddon.


DEAN

Which means that Abaddon's in the hunt for this thing, too. All right, you know what? This crap ends now. You're cut off. Okay? Kicking it. Cold turkey.


[Scene changes to CROWLEY being tied up in the Bunker dungeon. Again.]


CROWLEY

Back in this fetid pit. Could at least have added some throw pillows.


SAM [sitting by with his laptop]

Focus.

Okay. You swept the Mariana Trench. And...?


CROWLEY

And the First Blade was not, as hoped, in the Trench. It had, in fact, been scooped up by an unmanned sub, from whom it was stolen by a research assistant, who reportedly sold it to Portuguese smugglers who, in turn, lost it to Moroccan pirates in a poker game.


SAM [confused]

What?


CROWLEY

Poor moose. It's always a little tricky keeping up, isn't it?


SAM [looking up to find CROWLEY staring at him]

What are you doing?


CROWLEY

I'm still a little tainted by humanity. Makes me sentimental.


SAM

Well, stop.


CROWLEY

You and I both know we shared a mo back in that church. And on some level, we are bonded.


SAM

Crowley, the only reason you are alive is that we need your help to deal with Abaddon 'cause she is an even worse pile of crap than you are. And that is the extent of my concern for you. Got it?

Okay. What happened after the pirates?


[Scene changes to SAM and DEAN sitting on a bench outside in a park. They look to be waiting for someone. SAM looks around and sees CROWLEY digging in a vending machine a few yards off.]


SAM [exasperated]

What is Crowley doing?


DEAN looks around

Stealing candy.


SAM

He is -- he's -- he's stealing candy.


DEAN

You know, at least when Cas was human, he was an okay guy. Should've known Crowley would be a douche version.

[DEAN gets up and shouts at CROWLEY]

Hey. Hey! Cut it out, man! Image! You're the king of rotten. Act like it.

[CROWLEY gets pouty and moves to sit down at another bench.]


DEAN

You really think this guy's gonna show up? I mean, this isn't exactly a place where million-dollar deals go down.


SAM

Look, word is, this André Develin character bought the Blade from the pirates, and he's been shopping it around. That's all I know.

[A figure approaches]

Hey, heads up.


SAM

Mr. Develin, we spoke on the phone.


DEVELIN

You said you represent a serious collector with an interest in a private transaction.


DEAN

Did he? Oh. Well, what he meant to say was, is that we are with... The FBI.


DEVELIN

Then good evening.


SAM

Wait a second. We just want some answers.

DEVELIN

Read Sartre. Jean-Paul Sartre. I'm merely a facilitator between the buyer and the seller -- a conduit. So, unless I'm being detained --


[CROWLEY is overhearing the conversation and suddenly decides to take matters into his own hands. CROWLEY's red smoke rushes out of his mouth and across the park and into DEVELIN's mouth. A moment later it rushes out again and back into CROWLEY's meat suit. SAM and DEAN are startled]


DEVELIN

So, am I? Being detained?


DEAN [flustered]

Not at the...moment. No, but we've got our eyes on you.


CROWLEY [walking over to the Winchesters]

National Institute of Antiquities.


[Scene changes to an outside shot of the National Institute of Antiquities in Kansas City, Missouri. Inside two security guards are playing the card game Gin.]


SECURITY GUARD #1

Gin. Again.


[They hear a noise but before they can check it out two columns of demon smoke come under the door and force their way down their throats. The guards eye's turn black. SECURITY GUARD #1 goes to unlock a vault while SECURITY GUARD #2 stands guard. Suddenly a girl walks in with a bag of takeout.]


GIRL

Brought you guys something for your shift.


[SECURITY GUARD #2 grabs a knife from a table and cuts her throat. She falls to the ground dead.]


[Scene changes to a few hours later when the room is a crime scene. The two SECURITY GUARDs and the girl are all dead on the floor. Police are taking pictures and cataloging evidence. The HEAD DETECTIVE on the case is talking to SAM and DEAN who are there as FBI]



HEAD DETECTIVE

I don't have much for you guys. The guards were good men. They'd been here for years -- vetted, honest. But...


DEAN

But?


HEAD DETECTIVE

Security camera shows a research assistant caught them breaking into vault number one.


DEAN [pointing to the girl on the ground]

That's her?


HEAD DETECTIVE

Gets weirder.


[He shows them the security footage and it shows one security guard shooting the other one. Then the one that was just shot gets up and shoots the first guard. Then one guard shoots out the camera.]


Like I said.


SAM

Anything special about the particular vault they opened?


HEAD DETECTIVE

Vault number one is where they keep rare, new acquisitions while they're being examined.


DEAN

So what was stolen?


HEAD DETECTIVE

That's the kicker -- nothing. The curator, Dr. McElroy, said the vault's been empty for weeks.


[The HEAD DETECTIVE gets called away]


DEAN

Okay, so, just connecting the dots here -- the Blade was likely put in there when it first got here.


SAM

The guards were obviously demons, so... What? When the vault turned out to be empty, they killed

their guard meat-suits and smoked out?


DEAN

And reported back to who? Abaddon?


SAM

She's closing in.

ACT THREE
[SAM and DEAN are talking to the curator as the last body is rolled out.]


SAM

So, the First Blade was never on display?


DR. MCELROY

No authenticated item by that name was ever on these premises.


DEAN

"Authenticated." Dr. McElroy, this Blade was stolen and smuggled into the U.S. in violation of treaties with several governments. We can compel you to speak.


DR. MCELROY

"Compel"? And what might that involve?


[DEAN is slightly taken aback by her implication. SAM looks on ]


All right, look, I did acquire the so-called First Blade. And carbon dating did peg it to biblical times, but the authentication proved unreliable.


DEAN

So it was in the vault.


DR. MCELROY

I removed it myself. The guards didn't know.


SAM

And where is it now?


DR. MCELROY

Several weeks ago, a confidential offer was made to purchase it. I was afraid we would never authenticate the thing, so --


DEAN

Who was the buyer?


DR. MCELROY

Sorry. The buyer insisted on absolute secrecy.


DEAN

Well...federal statutes trump your little deal. So...the buyer?


DR. MCELROY [more flirty this time]

And you'll get it out of me one way or another, won't you, Agent?


[DEAN is starting to respond to the flirting and smirks a little]


DR. MCELROY

Hmm. I never did know his real identity. He called himself "Magnus." Don't ask me where he lives. I have no idea. But I do have a meeting. So, here is my number, should you need anything else.


[She hold out her card and SAM goes to take it. DR. MCELROY pulls it back and hand it over again, this time only for DEAN. DEAN takes the card. DR. MCELROY leaves and SAM gives him a "Really?" look]


DEAN

What?


SAM [chuckles and shakes his head]

Did you catch that? "Magnus"? "Albert Magnus"? The name the Men of Letters used when they want to be incognito?


DEAN

Yeah, but we know that all of the Men of Letters are dead.


SAM

Do we?


[Next scene is SAM and DEAN entering the Bunker's dungeon. CROWLEY is still sitting there trussed up.]


CROWLEY

Turndown service? I'd like a mint on my pillow.


SAM

What do you know about the Men of Letters massacre of 1958?


DEAN

We know Abaddon missed our grandfather and Larry Ganem. Was there anybody else?


CROWLEY

Let me get this straight. You keep me locked up in this closet, ignore my suffering, and then come barging in here and demand my help?


DEAN

More or less, yeah.


CROWLEY

Did I or did I not keep my end of the bargain the other night? Quite brilliantly, I might add. We are partners! And you owe me!


SAM

"Owe" you?


CROWLEY

I wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for you two. You shoot me up. You make me a junkie. You keep me stashed away for months while my kingdom falls apart?!


DEAN

What do you want?


[CROWLEY is sitting in the Bunker library drinking a scotch while SAM and DEAN rifle through boxes of Men of Letter's files.]


CROWLEY

It's not a very good scotch, is it?


SAM

Okay, Crowley, we have gone through the records for the entire membership in 1958. Every single name matches the men who were killed.


[CROWLEY is only half paying attention as he finds a Busty Asian Beauties magazine and starts looking through it]


CROWLEY

That would be the active membership, correct?


[SAM looks up and rolls his eyes]


CROWLEY

Were you two dropped on your heads a great deal? Like I told you, rumor has it that a rogue member was tossed out on his arse. Does that make him "active"? Seriously, boys, how did you ever function without me?

Well, hello, Miss Ichigatsu.


DEAN [picks up a file box and reads the label]

"Infamati et obliterati."


CROWLEY

"Dishonored and forgotten."


[Later SAM and DEAN are sitting across from each other at the table, still pouring over the files.]


DEAN

Wow. This guy was something.

[Hands a paper over to SAM]


SAM

Tough name.


DEAN

Yeah, Cuthbert Sinclair. I'd have just gone with "Magnus."


SAM

Looks like he designed most of the warding that keeps the bunker safe.


DEAN

Says here he was named "Master of Spell", right after he initiated.


SAM

I guess his work got a little crazy. The leadership called it "eccentric" and "irresponsible""


DEAN

K, so these are the projects that he proposed the last two years he was here. Look at this -- "rejected." "Rejected." "Rejected""


CROWLEY

So difficult -- brilliant, ahead of your time, despised for it. Trust me, I know.


DEAN

"Formal separation from Men of Letters -- April 1956."


SAM

He missed the massacre.


CROWLEY

I never knew his name, but I heard someone was out. Did my damndest to find him. Thought he might be my way inside this joint.


SAM

So where'd you look?


[Scene changes to the Winchesters and CROWLEY walking through a forest of tree and into a clearing.]


DEAN

So this is where your demons tracked him to?


CROWLEY

Exact spot. My boys never could find him. I'm sensing nothing, so if he's here, he's warded up to the gills.


SAM

Well, he was a genius at it, right? Sure as hell ain't gonna be found by a bunch of demons.


CROWLEY

Oh, like he's gonna open his heart to you lot, because you're such prizes?


DEAN

Better -- we're legacies.

All right, if he's so bent on hiding, maybe he's watching. Give it a shot.


SAM [speaking into the air]

Cuthbert Sinclair -- uh, Magnus -- whatever. We're Sam and Dean Winchester, Henry Winchester's grandsons.


DEAN

And Men of Letters, ourselves.


SAM

We know what happened back in the day. We don't necessarily agree with it. We figured...Maybe you want to tell your side of the story.


[There is nothing and so the boys turn back and look at CROWLEY but he puts behind them and there is a smoky doorway that rises from the ground. SAM and DEAN exchange looks and then walk through it. They are immediately in a hallway in a beautiful mansion.]


SAM

Which way?


[DEAN motions to the right and they walk down the hall. We when round the corner they are attacked y two vampires. They fight them off and behind both of them. Then over the intercom they hear clapping and a voice.]


VOICE

Bravo! Well done.


[Scene changes to SAM and DEAN sitting on a couch while a man, MAGNUS, pours himself a drink.]


MAGNUS

Sorry about all the theatricality. I just wanted to see what you two were made of.


DEAN

So, what, are we underground?


MAGNUS

No. No, my fortress is right where you were standing. But it's invisible.


SAM

Then you must be Cuthbert Sinclair.


MAGNUS

Ugh. I haven't gone by that moniker in, oh...57 years now.


DEAN

Well, you're looking good for a guy pushing...90?


MAGNUS

Well, thanks, sport. There's a spell for damn near everything. I am impressed, though. You did exactly

what you should've done. Though I am gonna miss those two from my zoo.


SAM

Your zoo?


MAGNUS

Oh, gentlemen, you are in the midst of the greatest collection of supernatural rarities and antiquities on the planet. I'm sorry. Did you say that you were Men of Letters? I thought that whole thing died out after '58.


SAM

Well, we are -- we are legacies. But actually, uh... We're hunters.


MAGNUS

Hunters? Wow! Hunters. With the key to the kingdom! The boys must be spinning in their graves. Damn snobs. Bunch of librarians, if you ask me. Although I was always fond of Henry. I was his mentor, you know? Yeah, till the squares gave me the boot. Yeah. 'Course, he came here to visit me, in secret. Called out to me, same as you did. Oh, yes. Quite the wild hair, your grandfather was.


DEAN

Listen, Magnus, uh... We got ourselves a little situation. Abaddon, the last Knight of Hell, is looking to up her pay grade and take over the place.


MAGNUS

Things never change, do they? I kept telling the boys over and over again -- I would say, "we could stop all this. We could rid the world of monsters once and for all if we just put our minds to it", but, "oh, no," they said. "No, no, no. It's not our place. We're here to study. We're here to catalog""


DEAN

Yeah, yeah, no, we get it. They're, uh...geeks.


MAGNUS

Mm.


DEAN

But she can be stopped. But we need something that we hear you have -- the First Blade.


MAGNUS

Hmm. I see. Interesting. But if you'd really done your homework, you would know that it's absolutely useless, unless, of course, you're possessing the Mark --


DEAN [pulling up his right sleeve to reveal the Mark in his arm]

...the Mark of Cain.


MAGNUS

Oh, my. How did you come by that?


SAM

Listen, if Abaddon takes over, the one thing she wants more than anything is to make hell on earth. Not even you can escape that.


MAGNUS

And they say all hunters are morons. It's right there behind you, gentlemen.


[SAM and DEAN turn around and the camera pulls back to show the First Blade on display. The Winchesters stand up.]


DEAN

Listen, if you're serious about taking action, this -- this is taking action. You loan us that Blade, and we will stop the bitch.


MAGNUS

Hmm. Let me think about it.

[He turns around and pinches some green powder from a tray on the end table.]

All right, I've thought about it.

[He blows the powder at SAM and recites a spell]

Abi, ab oculis meis!


[SAM disappears in a puff of smoke.]


ACT FOUR
[Scene opens with SAM rushing through the woods back to the IMPALA and CROWLEY.]


SAM [to CROWLEY]

Magnus has Dean.


[Back in MAGNUS' house DEAN is pissed.]


DEAN

What did you do with my brother?!


MAGNUS

Don't worry. He's fine. But I did what any good collector would do -- I separated the ordinary from the extraordinary. I had the First Blade. And now I have the Mark of Cain to complete the set.


DEAN

Yeah, well, problem is, it's attached. So how about you loan me the Blade and I take care of business?


MAGNUS

Dean, I am offering you the moon here -- to be part of the greatest collection of all time, to be young forever. Let me teach you my secrets. Hmm? Be my companion. I have to be honest with you, it has gotten lonely here over the years.


DEAN

When you were saying any of that, did it feel at all creepy? Yeah. I'm just gonna grab the Blade and go.


MAGNUS

One little design flaw to the place -- no windows, no doors.


DEAN [drawing a machete]

Well, in that case... I'll just make my own.


MAGNUS

Shen ti rán shao!


[DEAN's machete burns white hot and DEAN drops it as it burns his hand.]


DEAN

Aah!


MAGNUS

Eh? Tricky little spell, that first one, right? Chinese.

[DEAN goes for his gun but MAGNUS is holding it up]

Ah. Cheap magician's trick on that one -- picked your pocket. Nice gun.

Welcome to the collection, Dean.


[SAM is digging through the IMPALA's trunk to find anything to help him get back inside. CROWLEY takes a small peek and SAM draws Ruby's knife on him.]


SAM

You mind?


CROWLEY [backing off]

Who would have thunk it, eh, moose -- you and me, same team, in the trenches. When this is over, we can get matching tattoos.


SAM [takes the file box from the trunk and goes and sits in the passenger seat to look through it]

Just to be clear, Crowley, we are not on the same anything. By the way, since the place is warded, your powers are useless, which means you are useless, even more so than usual.



CROWLEY

You're gonna need another set of hands when you get in there, unless you have other volunteers in mind.


SAM

Thanks. Pass.


CROWLEY

If memory serves me, I'm the one who helped your brother find Cain so that we could find the Blade, so that Dean could receive the Mark. I'm the one who flushed that lout Gadreel out of your noggin. So, lately, big boy, I've seen more playing time than you.


SAM [exasperated]

Crowley, will you please shut the hell up?


[Back in MAGNUS' house, he has DEAN tied up to a post with chance around his ankles and upper arms.]


DEAN

Oh, you're a really sorry piece of work. You know that? Holed up in here, doing nothing. You bitch about the Men of Letters. You're way worse.


MAGNUS [holding the First Blade]

Should we fire it up? What do you say?


DEAN

Go to hell.


MAGNUS

Oh, come on, Dean. This is the object of your quest. Tell me Henry Winchester's grandson isn't curious to see if it works. Give me your hand.

[DEAN doesn't move so MAGNUS grabs his right hand and shoves the First Bland's handle into it.]

Give me...your hand.


[The Mark of CAIN glows red and DEAN instantly go rigid and his hand clutching the Blade starts to shake. He looks like he is fighting a strong power. He closes his eyes with the effort but then opens them again as he gets a faraway look in his eyes. The veins on his arm, next to the Mark, start turning red. MANGUS looks on with fascination. Suddenly the shaking in his hand gets worse and DEAN drops the Blade. He is breathing heavily and his right hand is still shaking.]


MANGUS [picking up the Blade]

That's it. Good. Next time, it'll be easier. You'll get used to the feelings, even welcome them.


[Outside it has turned dark, SAM is still going through the files by lantern light.]


SAM

Here's something. Apparently, he wanted to make the entire Men of Letters bunker invisible. All physical points of entry were to be eliminated, "and entrance would only be gained by spell."

Oh. We're gonna need some things. You actually might turn out to be useful, Crowley.


[Back inside]


MAGNUS

You'll come to understand, Dean -- nothing can stop us. Anything, anyone we want to own or destroy is ours.


DEAN

Well, how about this, Magnus? How about I take a knee? Then what are you gonna do? Huh? You gonna kill me? 'Cause without this thing on my arm, that Blade's nothing but a hunk of bone with teeth.


MAGNUS

Hmm. Well, I'm not asking you for your cooperation. I'm just taking it.

[MAGNUS grasps DEAN's head and recites a spell]

Mentem tuam ac voluntatem adsumo.

[DEAN eyes drain of all attitude or emotion]

Interesting effect, huh? All thought, all will just...drained out of you. I do this enough, you'll be ready for whatever I have in mind.


[Outside SAM is mixing a spell in a bowl as CROWLEY looks on]


CROWLEY

I did good, eh, moose? Everything on the list. You're welcome.


SAM [ignoring the plea, stands up and holds the bowl out]

Remember -- stay close, do what I say, and shut the hell up.


CROWLEY

I'm growing on you, aren't I?


SAM

Ingressum domi dona mihi.


[A smoky door rises from the ground and SAM an CROWLEY walk through it into MAGNUS' hallway.]


CROWLEY

Love what he's done with the place.


[They hear footsteps coming down the hallway and they duck around a corner. MAGNUS appears and goes to put a map in a drawer. When he turns his back, SAM leaps at him putting a knife to his throat.]


SAM

Take me to my brother.


[SAM enters the room where DEAN is tied up. DEAN sees him leading MAGNUS with a knife to his throat but calls out in a panic]


DEAN

Sam! No!


[MAGNUS turns into someone else and he grabs the knife from SAM and goes to stab him. SAM recovers quickly and manages to stab him first. The real MAGNUS is seen in the room with DEAN.]


MAGNUS [drawing DEAN's gun on SAM]

Shape-shifter. You see? There are benefits to keeping a zoo.


[A few minutes later, MAGNUS has tied SAM up just like DEAN on another post. He draws a blade from a display and walks over to the younger brother.]


MAGNUS

You know, I discarded you far too quickly, Sam. You're way more valuable than I thought you were. [To DEAN] Why would I knock myself out trying to sap your will? I think Sam here will get you to see things my way.


DEAN [comprehends that MAGNUS is going to torture SAM to get DEAN to say yes]

Magnus, I swear to God...


MAGNUS

What? What are you gonna do?

[Turning to SAM]

What is he gonna do? Huh?


[MAGNUS gashes open SAM's right cheek with his blade]


SAM

Unh!


[DEAN thrashes in his bonds in a panic.]

MAGNUS

Yeah, look, look, Sam, I'm not gonna kill you. Of course not.


[MAGNUS takes another slice in SAM's neck. SAM groans. DEAN in his terror suddenly notices CROWLEY peeking in through a doorway]


MAGNUS

But I am gonna make you suffer unimaginably, all right?


[There is a sound of dropping chains and both SAM and MAGNUS look over to where DEAN was. He is gone. But before MAGNUS can recover, DEAN dives at him with the First Blade and the Mark of Cain glowing red hot. MAGNUS is beheaded before he even knows what hit him.


DEAN is still holding the Blade in his shaking right hand. His eyes are barely human as he watches CROWLEY. SAM gently starts to call his name.]


SAM

Dean? Dean. Hey, it's over. He's dead.


[DEAN turns his eyes to the Blade and his arm that is still glowing hot. DEAN's lips starts to turn in a snarl with an almost animal like look. SAM starts to get more urgent.]


SAM

Drop the Blade, Dean.

[DEAN shows no indication that he has heard his brother]

Dean!!

[Suddenly a spark of humanity flashes in DEAN's eyes and they flicker to his brothers face. SAM holds his gaze.]

Drop the Blade.


[DEAN lets go and drops the Blade as he draws his shaking hand to his chest.]


ACT FIVE
[The Winchesters and CROWLEY walk back to the IMPALA]


CROWLEY

Brilliant, I must say. I'm speaking of myself, of course. All you two managed to do was get trussed up. Combine a little derring-do on my part, a little dumb muscle from squirrel, a little bleeding from moose...

[SAM and DEAN both step out of the woods and shock is written on their faces. CROWLEY is still talking]

Happy ending. Roll credits.


DEAN

No, no! Come on. What the hell?


[The IMPALA's doors are open and the car looks like it has been tossed in a search of something. DEAN runs to her and starts to check to make sure everything is okay.]


SAM

That's sulfur -- demons.


DEAN

Abaddon's. Well, she's just one jump behind us. Guess she couldn't find Magnus' joint, either. What about the trunk?


SAM

Safe. Warding kept them out.


DEAN [thoroughly pissed]

Demon mitts all over my baby.

[He shuts the back door and when he does sees that someone has keyed the whole side of the car with writing]

Oh, come on!! Oh, now they're keying cars?!


SAM [asking as DEAN kneels to get a better looks]

What language is that?


CROWLEY

It's Enochian. The message isn't for you. It's for me. "Be afraid. Your Queen." Abaddon's getting more brazen. She thinks I'm losing my grip.


SAM [turns to his brother his is just on his knees next to his car, anger emanating from him.

Dean. Dean.


[DEAN gets up, still very angry but listening to his brother.]


SAM

Listen, you said Crowley was only useful till we got the Blade. We got the Blade.


[DEAN's eye flicker to CROWLEY and that is when CROWLEY makes his move. He flings the Winchesters to the side of the car and holds them there. The First Blade falls from SAM's hand to the ground.]


CROWLEY

You know, boys, I'm in debt to you. You forced sobriety on me, and now I can see the situation for what it is. Dean, you are quite the killing machine. And it occurs to me that Abaddon is not the only name on your list. My name must be up there, as well.


DEAN

It's no good to you without me.


CROWLEY

Yes, but as long as I have it, it's no good to you.

[CROWLEY draws the Blade to him and holds it in his hand.]

Now, this is the way it's going to go -- I'll hang on to old donkey teeth here until such time as you locate Abaddon. Then you'll destroy her. You're right, moose. You can't trust me. But, sadly, I can't trust you, either.


[CROWLEY disappears and the boys are released from the side of the car. They stand there looking around in frustration.]
