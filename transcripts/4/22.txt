St. Mary's Convent
Ilchester, Maryland
1972

FLASHBACK - INT. ST. MARY'S CONVENT, ILCHESTER, MD - NIGHT

Through the dark and silent corridors of the convent, an unseen presence creeps along. A lone priest is extinguishing candles in the sanctuary. The presence rushes towards him: It is demon smoke. It pours into his mouth, possessing him. He screams.

CUT TO:

INT. ST. MARY'S CONVENT - DAY

The priest is standing at the altar, giving mass; seated in the pews behind him are eight nuns.

POSSESSED PRIEST
Our Father, who art in... heaven. Thy kingdom come, blah, blah, blah. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us... from evil.
(he turns and walks down the aisle during the following)
Truer words never spoken, sisters. But sometimes it seems as if it's difficult to know the Creator. Sometimes I feel, in a very literal sense, that I have been wandering the desert for years. Looking for our Father.
(he has reached the door and bolts it, then turns back)
Well, not our Father, my Father. See, he's in jail. Your dad put him there.
(the nuns begin to look nervous)
I almost gave up hope. But, ye of little faith, because I finally found him -- or at least, you know, a spot where his cage door opens. It's right here. In a damn convent, for God's sake. Life is funny.

NUN
Um, Father?

POSSESSED PRIEST
Shut your friggin' piehole, you little slut!
(he grins)
Then again, I suppose it makes sense. Folks forget my Daddy is an angel, after all. Or was. I mean, I suppose some dumb bastard stood here, felt a jolt of his holy juice and thought, I'm gonna build me a nun factory. You know? It's the right idea. Wrong angel.
(he blinks, and his eyes turn the familiar swirling yellow of Azazel. He draws a large knife.)
So, uh, if any of you guys are the praying type, now would be a good time to start.

The camera pulls back from the scene so that we only hear the terrified dying screams of the nuns, and focuses on an angel statue lit from behind.

TITLE CARD: SUPERNATURAL


ACT ONE

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Beginning in blurry focus, we sharpen into an extreme close-up of SAM's brooding face. Cut to a wide shot of a country house, with SAM and RUBY standing by an orange car out front. The episode title appears:

"Lucifer Rising"

RUBY
Sam? Your head in the game here?

SAM
(after a pause)
I'm good. Let's go.

RUBY
You okay?

SAM
I just said I was.

RUBY
Look, I know hand-holding really isn’t my thing... but still, Dean was wrong, saying what he said to you.

SAM
No, he was right to say it. I mean, I don't blame him after what I did.

RUBY
Well, after we're done, you guys will patch things up. I mean, you always do.

SAM
You're talking like I've got an 'after'.

RUBY
Don't say that.

SAM
I can feel it inside me, Ruby. I've changed... for good. And there's no going back now.

RUBY
Sam --

SAM
Look, I know what I gotta do. It's okay, I'm just saying, Dean's better off as far away from me as possible. Anyways. Doesn't matter, let's just get this done with.

They get in the car.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - DAY

Beginning in blurry focus, we sharpen into an extreme close-up of DEAN's brooding face. He is staring out the window; BOBBY is behind him.

BOBBY
Dean? Dean! You listen to a word I said?

DEAN
Yeah, I heard you. I'm not calling him.

BOBBY
Don't make me get my gun, boy.

DEAN
(turning to face him)
We are damn near kickoff for Armageddon, don't you think we got bigger fish at the moment?

BOBBY
I know you're pissed. And I'm not making apologies for what he's done, but he's your--

DEAN
Blood? He's my blood, is that what you were gonna say?

BOBBY
He's your brother. And he's drowning.

DEAN
Bobby, I tried to help him, I did. Look what happened.

BOBBY
So try again.

DEAN
It's too late.

BOBBY
There's no such thing.

DEAN
No, damnit! No. I gotta face the facts. Sam never wanted part of this family. He hated this life growing up. Ran away to Stanford first chance he got. Now it's like déjà vu all over again.
(he sits)
Well, I am sick and tired of chasing him. Screw him, he can do what he wants.

BOBBY
You don't mean that.

DEAN
Yes I do, Bobby. Sam's gone. He's gone. I'm not even sure if he's still my brother anymore. If he ever was.

BOBBY turns and leans on the table, fuming. After a moment he makes a big angry sweep with his hands, tossing books and papers to the ground. He advances on DEAN, who stands.

BOBBY
You stupid, stupid son of a bitch! Well, boo hoo, I am so sorry your feelings are hurt, princess! Are you under the impression that family's supposed to make you feel good?! Bake you an apple pie, maybe? They're supposed to make you miserable! That's why they're family!

DEAN
I told him, "you walk out that door, don't come back" and he walked out anyway! That was his choice!

BOBBY
You sound like a whiny brat. No, you sound like your dad. Well, let me tell you something. Your dad was a coward.

DEAN
My dad was a lot of things, Bobby, but a coward?

BOBBY
He'd rather push Sam away than reach out to him. Well, that don't strike me as brave. You are a better man than your daddy ever was. So you do both of us a favor. Don't be him.

DEAN turns back to staring out the window. We see a close-up of his face; he turns slowly, looking around in confusion at something we can't see until we pull back to reveal that the scene has shifted to:

INT. ANGELIC GREEN ROOM

DEAN finds himself in a large, lavishly appointed room. The walls are painted white with gold trim and accents, and a marble table stands in the center. CASTIEL is there.

CASTIEL
Hello, Dean. It's almost time.


INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The possessed nurse we met at the end of the previous episode is wheeling an infant out of a patient's room.

DEMONIC NURSE
We're gonna take you to the nursery, sugar -- Let mommy and daddy get some sleep. He's a beautiful child. Absolutely scrumptious.
(singing to the baby)
Patty-cake, patty-cake, baker's man bake me a cake as fast as you can.
(she pushes the bassinette through a door and into an abandoned corridor.)
Pat it and roll it
(her eyes turn black)
and mark it with a "b"
and put it in the oven --

She is suddenly dragged backwards by an unseen force and hurled against the far wall. SAM approaches her calmly, RUBY behind him.

SAM
So. We need to talk.


INT. ANGELIC GREENROOM

DEAN pokes around the room, looking at the magnificent pastoral paintings on the walls. He turns back to the table and finds that it now holds a silver bowl packed with ice and full of beer bottles, and a large platter of hamburgers. He picks up a beer bottle and looks at it.

ZACHARIAH
Hello, Dean. You're looking fit.

DEAN
(replaces the beer bottle) Well, how 'bout this? ""The suite life of Zach and Cas."
(off their blank looks)
It's a... never mind. So, what is this? Where the hell am I?

ZACHARIAH
Call it a Green room. We're closing in on the grand finale, here. We want to keep you safe before showtime.
(indicating the food on the table)
Try a burger. They're your favorite. From that seaside shack in Delaware. You were 11, I think.

DEAN
I'm not hungry.

ZACHARIAH
No? How about Ginger from season 2 of "Gilligan's Island"? You do have a thing for her, don't you?

DEAN
Tempting. Weird.

ZACHARIAH
We'll throw in Mary Ann for free.

DEAN
No, no. Let's... bail on the holodeck, okay? I want to know what the game plan is.

ZACHARIAH
Let us worry about that. We want you... focused, relaxed.

DEAN
Well, I'm about to be pissed and leaving, so start talking, Chuckles.

ZACHARIAH
(sighs)
All the seals have fallen. Except one.

DEAN
That's an impressive score. That's... that's right up there with the Washington Generals.

ZACHARIAH
You think sarcasm's appropriate, do you? Considering... you started all this? But the final seal... it'll be different.

DEAN
Why?

ZACHARIAH
Lilith has to break it. She's the only one who can. Tomorrow night -- midnight.

DEAN
Where?

ZACHARIAH
We're working on it.

DEAN
Well, work harder.

ZACHARIAH
we'll do our job. You just make sure you do yours.

DEAN
Yeah, and what is that, exactly? If I'm supposed to be the one that stops her, how? With the knife?

ZACHARIAH
All in good time.

DEAN
Isn't now a good time?

ZACHARIAH
Have faith.

DEAN
What, in you? Give me one good reason why I should.

ZACHARIAH
(getting in DEAN'S face)
Because you swore your obedience. So obey.

DEAN looks past him at CASTIEL, who looks down guiltily.


INT. CELLAR - NIGHT

There is a flickering wood fire in the corner that provides the only light for the room. The DEMONIC NURSE is laid out on the table; SAM and RUBY stand above her.

DEMONIC NURSE
(struggling)
What, no devil's trap?

SAM
I don't need one.

DEMONIC NURSE
Look at you -- all 'roided up. It's like A-Rod and Madonna over here.

SAM
Where's Lilith?

DEMONIC NURSE
I'm not scared of you.

SAM
Yeah, you are, actually. And with good reason.

DEMONIC NURSE
Look... what's my upside? Okay, I tell you, you kill me. I don't tell you, you still kill me. I get away somehow, Lilith will definitely kill me. So where's my carrot?

SAM
I think what you should be worrying about is what happens before you die.

SAM reaches out a hand and concentrates. She begins to scream in agony.


INT. ANGELIC GREENROOM

DEAN is now alone in the room, pacing. He's holding his phone and considers it.

DEAN
Ah, screw it.
(opens the phone and dials)

SAM'S VOICE (RECORDED)
It's Sam. Leave me a message.
(beep)

DEAN
Hey, it's me. Uh...
(clears throat)
Look, I'll just get right to it. I'm still pissed... and I owe you a serious beatdown. But... I shouldn't have said what I said. You know, I'm not Dad. We're brothers. You know, we're family. And, uh... no matter how bad it gets, that doesn't change. Sammy, I'm sorry.
(beep)

He hangs up.


INT. CELLAR - NIGHT

DEMONIC NURSE
(still screaming in agony)
Stop! Stop! Please!

SAM
You'll tell me where she is?

DEMONIC NURSE
Fine. Fine. Just... let me die.

SAM
(drops his hand)
Deal.

DEMONIC NURSE
(breathing heavily)
Tomorrow night, midnight. She's gonna be at a convent -- St. Mary's, Ilchester, Maryland.

SAM
A convent?

DEMONIC NURSE
Lilith... She's gonna break the final seal.

SAM
And what is the final seal?

DEMONIC NURSE
I don't know.
(SAM begins to torture her again)
Aaaah! I don't know! I don't know!
(sobbing)
I don't know! I swear! Please! I'm begging you. Kill me, please!

SAM
Fine.

He reaches out a hand to kill her; RUBY grabs his arm and stops him.

RUBY
Wait. You can't.

SAM
Why not?

RUBY
Because we've got to take her with us. It's the final run on the Death Star, and you need more juice than I got.

DEMONIC NURSE
You promised.

RUBY
Sorry, sister. You're a walking, talking can of whup-ass.

DEMONIC NURSE
You bitch!

RUBY
I know. Just can't trust anyone these days.

DEMONIC NURSE
(settles back)
Well, least you won't be able to crack me open that easy.

RUBY
That so?

DEMONIC NURSE
Don't forget -- it's not just me you're bleeding. In fact, I think I'm gonna take a little... siesta in the subconscious -- hand over the wheel for a little bit.

SAM
What are you talking about?

DEMONIC NURSE
Cindy McClellan, R.N., come on down!

She shuts her eyes and relaxes; the host wakes up with a gasp.

CINDY
What...
(groans)
Where am I?
(struggles)
Oh, my god, I can't move. What's going on? Help! Help me, please.

RUBY
(annoyed)
Great.

END ACT ONE


ACT TWO

FLASHBACK
INT. ST. MARY'S CONVENT - 1972

AZAZEL kneels before the altar, the bloody bodies of the nuns sprawled around him. One is splayed out on the altar, facing him in a reverse-crucifixion pose. He speaks towards this one during the following.

AZAZEL
Father, look... I'm not exactly the praying type, but still... I made the sacrifice. I got you a bagful of nuns. So, uh... can you hear me? Can you whisper through the door?

DEAD NUN CHANNELING LUCIFER
(in distorted gender-ambiguous voice)
I'm here, my son.

AZAZEL
It's so good to hear your voice, Padre. I have been searching for you for so long. You have no idea. The others have lost faith. Dickless heathens. But not me.

LUCIFER
You've done well.

AZAZEL
So, uh... how do I bust you out?

LUCIFER
Lilith.

AZAZEL
Lilith? Father, she's... trapped neck-deep in the pit. It won't be easy.

LUCIFER
Lilith. Lilith can break the seals.

AZAZEL
Yeah, okay. But what do I do?

LUCIFER
You must find me a child. A very special child.

AZAZEL
(Eyes flash yellow)
What do you mean? What child?


INT. MOTEL ROOM

SAM is doing research on his laptop. RUBY stands in the background.

SAM
You got to be kidding me.

RUBY
What?

SAM
Get this.
(reading from his laptop screen)
St. Mary's -- abandoned in '72 after a priest disemboweled eight nuns.

RUBY
(smirking)
What's black and white and red all over?

SAM
That's not funny.
(continuing to read)
The priest said it wasn't his fault. He said a demon made him do it. And that he even remembered the demon's name.

RUBY
Yeah?

SAM
Azazel.

RUBY
Wow. So, Lilith, Yellow-Eyes -- all the A-listers are paying visits. Certainly gives the joint credibility.

SAM
As a place where the final seal goes down.

RUBY
Well, it's good enough for me. Let's pack up Nurse Betty and hit the road.

SAM
Hey, maybe, um... look.

RUBY
What?

SAM
M-maybe we can find another demon.

RUBY
Sam, no. That blubbery "don't hurt me" crap -- it's just an act. She's playing you.

SAM
I'm not so sure.

RUBY
Even if she's not, there's still a hell-bitch snoozing in there. I mean, come on. It's not like you haven't done this before, right?


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

SAM manhandles CINDY down the steps and out to the car. She's struggling, pleading with him. He's trying very hard to ignore this.

CINDY
No. Please don’t. Just listen to me, okay? My name is Cindy McClellan. I'm a nurse in the NICU over at Enfield Memorial. I have a husband named Matthew, okay? We've been married six years. He's got to be worried sick about me. And I don't even know who you are, and I'm not gonna tell anybody anything. Please just let me go.
(SAM opens the trunk; she starts screaming)
No! No! Please, no! Please --
(he shoves her in the trunk and shuts it)
(muffled)
Help!
(SAM leans on the trunk breathing heavily)


INT. ANGELIC GREENROOM

DEAN is frustrated. He pokes at one of the numerous figurines on one of the many mantlepieces and tips it deliberately to the ground. It shatters with a crash just as CASTIEL appears behind him. He turns around, looking slightly guilty.

CASTIEL
You asked to see me?

DEAN
(clears throat)
Yeah, listen, I, uh, I-I need something.

CASTIEL
Anything you wish.

DEAN
I need you to take me to see Sam.

CASTIEL
Why?

DEAN
There's something I got to talk to him about.

CASTIEL
What's that?

DEAN
(sarcastic)
The B.M. I took this morning. What's it to you? Just make it snappy.

CASTIEL
I don't think that's wise.

DEAN
Well, I didn't ask you for your opinion.

CASTIEL
Have you forgotten what happened the last time you met?

DEAN
No. That's the whole point. Listen, I'm gonna do whatever you mooks want, okay? I just need to tie up this one thing. Five minutes -- that's all I need.

CASTIEL
No.

DEAN
What do you mean, no? Are you saying that I'm trapped here?

CASTIEL
You can go wherever you want.

DEAN
Super. I want to go see Sam.

CASTIEL
Except there.

DEAN
I want to take a walk.

CASTIEL
Fine. I'll go with you.

DEAN
Alone.

CASTIEL
No.

DEAN
You know what? Screw this noise. I'm out of here.

He heads for the door.

CASTIEL
Through what door?

DEAN turns to face him, frowning. When he turns back, the door has been replaced by a smooth wall. He turns back to face CASTIEL, who has also disappeared.

DEAN
Damn it.


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

RUBY is driving. SAM is in the passenger seat staring at his cell phone, which displays "1 new voicemail from: Dean". He isn't playing it. CINDY screams in the trunk.

RUBY
What are you -- a 12-year-old girl? Just play it already.

SAM
Mind your own business.

CINDY
Let me out! Let me out! (thumping on the roof of the trunk)

SAM
God, I wish she would just shut up.

RUBY
Well, that can be arranged.
(off SAM's glare)
I don't get it. All the demons you cut with the knife -- what do you think happens to the host? How is this any different?

SAM
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

RUBY
I know that you're having a tough time here, Sam, but we're in the final lap here. Now is not the time to grow a persqueeter.

SAM
Would you drop the friggin' attitude? I'm about to bleed and drink an innocent woman. While she watches.

RUBY
And save the world as a result.

SAM
I don't know. I-I just... I'm starting to think... maybe Dean was right.

RUBY
About what?

SAM
About everything.

RUBY
We're gonna see this through, right, Sam? Sam?

CINDY
Let me out! Let me out! (screaming and thumping on the roof of the trunk)


INT. ANGELIC GREENROOM

DEAN is attempting to break through a wall with a pedestal. He has smashed through to the foundations, but when he pauses, the wall repairs itself. He throws the pedestal to the floor.

DEAN
Son of a bitch.

ZACHARIAH
(Appearing suddenly)
Quit hurling feces like a howler monkey, would you? It's unbecoming.

DEAN
Let me out of here.

ZACHARIAH
Like I told you: too dangerous out there. Demons on the prowl.

DEAN
I've been getting my ass kicked all year. Now you're sweating my safety? You're lying. I want to see my brother.

ZACHARIAH
That's... ill-advised.

DEAN
You know, I am so sick of your crap riddles and your smug, fat face. What the hell is going on, huh? Why can't I see Sam? And how am I gonna ice Lilith?

ZACHARIAH
(sighs)
You're not. ...Going to ice Lilith.

DEAN
What?

ZACHARIAH
Lilith's going to break the final seal. Fait accompli at this point. Train's left the station.

DEAN
But me and Sam, we can stop...
(he cuts off, having an epiphany)
You don't want to stop it, do you?

ZACHARIAH
Nope. Never did. The end is nigh. The apocalypse is coming, kiddo, to a theater near you.

DEAN
What was all that crap about saving seals?

ZACHARIAH
Our grunts on the ground -- we couldn't just tell them the whole truth. We'd have a full-scale rebellion on our hands. I mean, think about it. Would we really let 65 seals get broken unless senior management wanted it that way?

DEAN
But why?

ZACHARIAH
Why not? The apocalypse? Poor name, bad marketing -- puts people off. When all it is is Ali/Foreman. On a... slightly larger scale. And we like our chances. When our side wins -- and we will -- it's paradise on earth. Now, what's not to like about that?

DEAN
What happens to all the people during your little pissing contest?

ZACHARIAH
Well... you can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs. In this case... truckloads of eggs, but you get the picture. Look... it happens. This isn't the first planetary enema we've delivered.
(he notices DEAN eyeing a statue on a mantelpiece)
Uh, no, Dean. Probably shouldn't try to bash my skull in with that thing. Wouldn't end up too pleasant for you.

DEAN
What about Sam? He won't go quietly. He'll stop Lilith.

ZACHARIAH
(inhales deeply)
Sam... has a part to play. A very important part. He may need a little nudging in the right direction, but I'll make sure he plays it.

DEAN
What does that mean? What are you gonna do to him?

ZACHARIAH
Sam, Sam, Sam. Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. Forget about him, would you? You have larger concerns. Why do you think I'm confiding in you? You're still vital, Dean. We weren't lying about your destiny. Just... omitted a few pertinent details. But nothing's changed. You are chosen. You will stop it. Just... not Lilith, or the apocalypse. That's all.

DEAN
Which means?

ZACHARIAH
(gesturing to a painting on the wall: Saint Michel terrassant le Dragon by Josse Lieferinxe) Lucifer. You're going to stop Lucifer. You're our own little Russell Crowe, complete with surly attitude. And when it's over... and when you've won... your rewards will be... unimaginable. Peace, happiness... two virgins and seventy sluts.
(chuckles)
Trust me -- one day, we'll look back on this and laugh.

DEAN
Tell me something. Where's God in all this?

ZACHARIAH
God? God has left the building.


END ACT TWO


ACT THREE

INT. ST. MARYS - NIGHT

A night guard is patrolling the abandoned corridors, seemingly alone; LILITH, wearing a white sleeveless gown and the same host we saw in her last appearance, is suddenly behind him. She smiles innocently.

LILITH
Howdy.

GUARD
Lady, this is private property. You're not supposed to be here.

LIITH
But I'm here for mass. And so are you.

Her eyes go white; the GUARD screams as we cut away.


INT. ANGELIC GREENROOM

DEAN is attempting to call SAM again. He dials the phone, but hears only static. CASTIEL appears behind him.

CASTIEL
You can't reach him, Dean. You're outside your coverage zone.

DEAN
What are you gonna do to Sam?

CASTIEL
Nothing. He's gonna do it to himself.

DEAN
What's that supposed to mean?
(CASTIEL looks down)
Oh, right, right. Got to toe the company line. Why are you here, Cas?

CASTIEL
We've been through much together, you and I. And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry it ended like this.

DEAN
"Sorry"?
(he punches CASTIEL, who hardly flinches. DEAN flexes his hand in pain.)
It's Armageddon, Cas. You need a bigger word than "sorry."

CASTIEL
Try to understand -- this is long foretold. This is your...

DEAN
Destiny? Don't give me that "holy" crap. Destiny, God's plan... It's all a bunch of lies, you poor, stupid son of a bitch! It's just a way for your bosses to keep me and keep you in line! You know what's real? People, families -- that's real. And you're gonna watch them all burn?

CASTIEL
What is so worth saving? I see nothing but pain here. I see inside you. I see your guilt, your anger, confusion. In paradise, all is forgiven. You'll be at peace. Even with Sam.

DEAN
You can take your peace... and shove it up your lily-white ass. 'Cause I'll take the pain and the guilt. I'll even take Sam as is. It's a lot better than being some Stepford bitch in paradise. This is simple, Cas! No more crap about being a good soldier. There is a right and there is a wrong here, and you know it.
(CASTIEL turns away)
Look at me!
(DEAN grabs CASTIEL’s shoulder and turns CASTIEL back to face him)
You know it! You were gonna help me once, weren't you? You were gonna warn me about all this, before they dragged you back to Bible camp. Help me -- now. Please.

CASTIEL
What would you have me do?

DEAN
Get me to Sam. We can stop this before it's too late.

CASTIEL
I do that, we will all be hunted. We'll all be killed.

DEAN
If there is anything worth dying for... this is it.
(CASTIEL shakes his head and looks down)
You spineless...
(DEAN turns and walks away)
…soulless son of a bitch. What do you care about dying? You're already dead. We're done.

CASTIEL
Dean --

DEAN
We're done!

DEAN turns to look behind him, but CASTIEL has disappeared.


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

SAM stands before a sign that reads: ST. MARY'S CONVENT - 2 miles. RUBY is a few paces behind him, by the car. We can still faintly hear CINDY pounding and screaming in the trunk.

RUBY
Sam, it's time. Are we doing this or not?

SAM
Give me a minute to think.

RUBY
Sam --

SAM
Give me a damn minute, Ruby!

RUBY
Better think fast.

SAM surreptitiously pulls his cell phone from his pocket and presses a button.

VOICE ON PHONE
First unheard message.

DEAN'S VOICE
Listen to me, you bloodsucking freak. Dad always said I'd either have to save you or kill you. Well, I'm giving you fair warning. I'm done trying to save you. You're a monster, Sam -- a vampire. You're not you anymore. And there's no going back.
(beep)

RUBY smirks behind his back. Close to tears, SAM slowly lowers the phone and shuts it off.

SAM
Do it.

RUBY
Thank god.
(she opens the trunk)

CINDY
No!
(screams and struggles)


INT. ANGELIC GREEN ROOM

DEAN is pacing. He pauses in front of the platter of hamburgers and considers. He takes one. Suddenly CASTIEL appears behind him, grabs him by the shoulder, and shoves him against the wall, pressing a hand over his mouth and drawing the knife. A moment passes while they stare at each other, then DEAN nods slightly. CASTIEL lets him go. He draws the knife across his forearm and takes the blood with his other hand, smearing it on the wall to form the angel banishing sigil. ZACHARIAH appears.

ZACHARIAH
Castiel! Would you mind explaining just what the hell you're doing?

CASTIEL finishes drawing and slams his hand in the center of the sigil. In a violent flash of white light, ZACHARIAH vanishes.

CASTIEL
He won't be gone long. We have to find Sam now.

DEAN
Where is he?

CASTIEL
I don't know. But I know who does. We have to stop him, Dean, from killing Lilith.

DEAN
But Lilith's gonna break the final seal.

CASTIEL
Lilith is the final seal. She dies, the end begins.

END ACT THREE


ACT FOUR

INT. CHUCK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CHUCK is on the phone with what appears to be an escort service. He is pacing in his kitchen. The document on his computer screen reads “Supernatural – Lucifer Rising by Carver Edlund”.

CHUCK
Oh, yeah? Really? At the same time? Really? Wow. T-that sounds... moist.

WOMAN (on the phone)
(laughs) Well, it can be.

CHUCK
Uh, what are your rates?

WOMAN (on the phone)
We can get you one girl, one hour -- $1,000.

CHUCK
Okay. Then, uh, I'll take 20 girls for the whole night.

WOMAN
I'm not sure you can afford that.

CHUCK
Lady, sometimes you got to live like there's no tomorrow.

CASTIEL and DEAN appear suddenly. CHUCK looks up in shock.

CHUCK
Wait. T-t-this isn't supposed to happen.

WOMAN
Sir?

CHUCK
(into the phone)
No, lady, this is definitely supposed to happen, but I just got to call you back.
(he hangs up)
I...


INT. ST. MARY'S CONVENT - NIGHT

LILITH has acquired a number of demonic minions and is setting up something ritual-like at the altar. A minion approaches her nervously, holding a chalice full of blood. He hands it to her and looks down. She smiles at him.

LILITH
Don't be afraid. We're going to save the world.

He walks away and she turns her back. There is a sudden deep rumbling noise. When she turns back, all of the minions that had been lining the hallway have collapsed to the ground. Around the corner, SAM appears. He stalks forward deliberately. LILITH raises a hand; the door between her and SAM slams shut.


INT. CHUCK'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

DEAN
St. Mary's? What is that, a convent?

CHUCK
Yeah, but you guys aren't supposed to be there. You're not in this story.

CASTIEL
Yeah, well...
(he glances at DEAN)
We're making it up as we go.

CHUCK’s computer screen flickers as a great rumbling begins, accompanied by a blinding white light.

CHUCK
Aw, man! Not again! No!

CASTIEL
It's the Archangel!
(to DEAN)
I'll hold him off! I'll hold them all off! Just stop Sam!

CASTIEL claps DEAN on the forehead, transporting him away.


INT. ST. MARY'S - NIGHT

DEAN appears in an empty part of the convent, looks around and walks down a hallway.


INT. CHUCK'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

CASTIEL and CHUCK stand side by side to face what comes. CHUCK places a hand on CASTIEL'S shoulder; CASTIEL gives him a look, and CHUCK drops his hand in embarrassment.


INT. ST. MARY'S - NIGHT

SAM enters the sanctuary and flings out a hand. LILITH is flung across the room, slamming into the altar and falling to the ground. SAM, with RUBY behind him, advances on LILITH and flings out his hand again. LILITH is forced back against the altar. DEAN comes around a corner and sees what is happening in the sanctuary. RUBY looks back at DEAN and smiles. She puts out a hand and the doors to the sanctuary close.

SAM walks towards LILITH. We can hear a loud, gradually quickening heartbeat.

SAM
I've been waiting for this... for a very long time.

LILITH
Then give me your best shot.

SAM reaches out a hand, throwing his power at her. White light shines on LILITH and she cries out in pain. SAM lowers his hand, the light fades and the heartbeat slows.

DEAN
(from the other side of the bolted door)
Sam!

SAM turns to look at the door.

DEAN
Sam!
(he bangs on the door)
Sam!

From SAM'S POV, the sound of the heartbeat takes over almost all other sound. DEAN'S voice and pounding are distant and faint, but he turns in confusion anyway.

SAM
Dean?

RUBY
(to SAM's ears, she is even more faint than DEAN)
What are you waiting for?! Now! Sam, now!

LILITH
(laughing)
You turned yourself into a freak. A monster. And now you're not gonna bite? I'm sorry, but that is honestly adorable.

The heartbeat quickens; SAM faces LILITH and raises his hand again. His eyes turn black as he concentrates his power and hurls it at LILITH. She convulses several times, her body glowing and flickering. At last she goes limp. SAM's eyes turn back to normal.

The sound of the heartbeat slows.


END ACT FOUR


EPILOGUE

Blood is pouring out of LILITH'S body in a steady stream; the stream is flowing in what looks like a very deliberate direction.

SAM
What the hell?

RUBY
I can’t believe it.

SAM
Ruby, what’s going on?

RUBY
You did it. I mean, it was a little touch-and-go there for a while, but... you did it.

SAM
What? What -- what did I do?

RUBY
You opened the door. And now he's free at last. He's free at last!

SAM
(in denial)
No, no, no. No, he -- Lilith -- I stopped her. I killed her!

RUBY
(fervently)
And it is written that the first demon shall be the last seal. And you bust her open.
(SAM puts his hands to his head)
Now guess who's coming to dinner.

SAM
Oh, my god.

RUBY
Guess again.

DEAN pounds at the door with a large candelabra.

RUBY
You don't even know how hard this was! All the demons out for my head. No one knew. I was the best of those sons of bitches! The most loyal! Not even Alastair knew! Only Lilith! Yeah, I'm sure you're a little angry right now, but, I mean, come on, Sam! Even you have to admit -- I'm -- I'm awesome!

SAM
You bitch. You lying bitch!
(He thrusts his hands at her, trying to use his powers, but he drops, clutching his head instead.)

RUBY
Don't hurt yourself, Sammy. It's useless. You shot your payload on the boss.

SAM
The blood... You poisoned me.

RUBY
(kneeling in front of him)
No. It wasn't the blood. It was you... and your choices. I just gave you the options, and you chose the right path every time. You didn't need the feather to fly, you had it in you the whole time, Dumbo! I know it's hard to see it now... but this is a miracle. So long coming. Everything Azazel did, and Lilith did. Just to get you here. And you were the only one who could do it.

SAM
Why? W-why me?

RUBY
Because... because it had to be you, Sammy. It always had to be you. You saved us. You set him free. And he's gonna be grateful. He's gonna repay you in ways that you can't even imagine.

DEAN finally breaks in and draws the knife. RUBY stands to confront him.

RUBY
You're too late.

DEAN
I don't care.

DEAN advances on RUBY. SAM stands and grabs her from behind, holding her in place as DEAN stabs her. She flickers with light, then crumples to the floor, dead.

SAM
(to DEAN, brokenly)
I'm sorry.

The blood pouring out of LILITH has finished its pattern on the floor. A brilliant white light shoots up from the central point of the pattern and the convent begins to tremble.

DEAN
Sammy, let's go.

SAM
(clutching at DEAN's shirt as DEAN grabs SAM’s jacket, and staring at the light)
Dean... he's coming.

Another flash of white, and we cut to black.
