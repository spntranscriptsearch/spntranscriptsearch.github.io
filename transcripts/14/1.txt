TEASER
[“SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES” by AC/DC is playing]
[EXT. ROAD – NIGHT]
[We see the IMPALA speeding down the highway.]
[INT. IMPALA – NIGHT]
[SAM is driving. He turns the stereo off. The music stops. He keeps driving in the night.]
[INT. ROOM – MORNING]
[A man, JAMIL, is resting on his bed. He wakes up, stops the music on his phone and lazily throws it away.]
[INT. ROOM – LATER]
[Jamil is getting ready to pray. He speaks Arabic.]
JAMIL
(in Arabic)
Glorified be you, all praise is yours, perfect is your name, most high is your majesty and greatness. None has the right to be worshipped but you, the only one God.
[He places his knees, hands and hands on the floor.]
JAMIL
(in Arabic)
Glorified be my God, the highest. Glorified be my God, the highest. Glorified be my God, the highest.
[Jamil looks up. In front of him, MICHAEL is sitting on a chair and staring down at him, wearing DEAN’s vessel. Jamil falls back, scared.]
MICHAEL
Hello, Jamil.
JAMIL
Who are you?
MICHAEL
Oh, we’ve never met. But you’ve read all about me. How does it go?
(in Arabic)
Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel and Michael then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.
[Michal’s eyes glow BLUE.]
JAMIL
You’re… God?
MICHAEL
Close, but… not quite.
JAMIL
Gabriel?
MICHAEL
The other one. The better one.
JAMIL
Michael.
MICHAEL
There we go.
JAMIL
No, no, no, no. Why are you here?
MICHAEL
Well, that is the question, isn’t it?
[Michael stands up.]
MICHAEL
Why are we here. I know why I’m here to ask you a question.
JAMIL
What question?
MICHAEL
The same question I’ve spent weeks traveling around this world asking all sorts of people. Holy men, leaders, killers. And now I come to you, Jamil Hamed. (pause) What do you want?
JAMIL
What?
MICHAEL
Do you want? Exactly. If you could have anything, name it.
JAMIL
Peace. And love.
MICHAEL
If you cared about peace, you never would have left Syria. You never would have ran and abandoned your friends to die – and they did die.
JAMIL
No.
MICHAEL
And if you cared about love, you never would have gone into that broom closet with – What was her name?
JAMIL
(breathing shakily)
No.
MICHAEL
Darlene? Your wife would have never left and you wouldn’t be living in this... rat hole.
[Jamil tries to attack Michael, who throws him on the floor without even moving.]
MICHAEL
And that’s the problem with you. You’re lost... And not worth saving.
JAMIL
Wha—what—what do you want?
MICHAEL
What I always wanted... a better world.
[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE
[EXT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER – NIGHT]
[Establishing shot.]
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER – NIGHT]
[Survivors from the AU are preparing their weapons. MARY approaches one of them.]
MARY
Hi.
MAN
(pointing at various bullets)
You got silver. Devil’s trap. Holy Oil.
(he grabs a gun)
And these here, they’re dipped in Dean Man’s blood.
[Mary takes the gun and loads it.]
MAN
Basically, you need some freak dead? I got you.
[Mary checks the gun. In front of her a girl, MAGGIE, is helping another survivor with his wounds.]
MAGGIE
A rawhead did this?
MAN #2
Yeah. Outside Phoenix. They’re faster than they look.
[Maggie extracts a fang from the wound.]
MAN #2
Meaner, too.
MAGGIE
So, so gross.
[The door creaks open. A man walks in.]
MAN #3
Soup’s on. Who’s eating?
MAN #2
Right here.
WOMAN
Yeah, I’ll –
[Sam enters the bunker. He walks down the stairs.]
MAN
Yeah, right here. How about you guys?
MAN #2
I’ll have soup.
MARY
Sam.
SAM
Hey, Mom.
[Sam and Mary hug.]
MARY
How was Atlanta?
SAM
It was, uh... It was a bust. The woman who claims she saw an “angel”... was... (he snorts) Let’s just say I think she had one too many hits of the brown acid, you know?
MARY
Sam, we’re gonna find him. Ketch is working that thing in London. Castiel is in Detroit. I know it’s been three weeks since Dean... (pause) Something will break. It has to.
SAM
Yeah. Yeah, you keep saying that.
[Sam yawns.]
MARY
Have you slept? At all. Sam, you need to rest. Go and lay down.
SAM
Mom –
MAN
Chief.
SAM
Hey.
MAN
Good to have you back.
[The man hands Sam a bowl of soup.]
SAM
Thanks.
MAN
Don’t thank me yet. Word is we got some vamps heading East on I-90. Gipsy types. Pickin’ off truckers mostly.
MAN #2
Last body got drained and dropped just outside La Crosse six hours ago.
SAM
Okay. Um... All right. Get me teams of two. I want watch points every 50 miles. If you see something, say something. Maggie, can you hack the traffic cams on the freeway?
MAGGIE
Um... no.
SAM
Right. Right. Of course. Sorry. Um, I got it. Thank you.
[He gives his soup to Mary.]
SAM
Uh, please. Would you call in Sharon and her crew? We’re gonna need all hands on deck here.
MAN #3
Yes, sir.
SAM
Thank you.
[Sam sits down, starts typing on his laptop. Mary approaches him again.]
MARY
Sam --
SAM
I’m good.
[Mary puts a hand on his. Sam looks at her.]
SAM
I’m good. I am. Hey, how’s Jack?
[INT. JACK’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS]
[JACK falls on his back, groaning. He’s wearing boxing gloves. BOBBY is staring down at him. They are boxing.]
BOBBY
Watch for that left.
JACK
I never had to fight before.
BOBBY
Mm-hmm. Life’s a little different when you can’t just zap people around, huh?
JACK
A lot different. Yeah.
[Bobby helps him get back on his feet.]
BOBBY
You’ll get used to it. Truth be told, this stuff didn’t come all that easy for me, either. Had my ass handed to me more times than I can count.
JACK
But you kept fighting.
BOBBY
You got to. As a wise man once said, “It ain’t how hard ya hit. It’s how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.”
JACK
Was that Gandhi?
BOBBY
Probably. Yeah, somethin’ like that. Yeah. So, what are you gonna do?
JACK
Watch the left.
BOBBY
Attaboy. Attaboy.
[They resume their training. Jack takes Bobby’s hits.]
BOBBY
Ah, that’s it.
[EXT. MOTOWN’S BBQ MEATS - NIGHT]
[Establishing shot.]
[INT. MOTOWN’S BBQ MEATS - NIGHT]
[COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS]
[The door creaks open. We see a pair of elegant Oxford shoes making their way in, belonging to a man wearing sunglasses and dressed in an elegant way.]
KIPLING
Castiel, darling.
[He walks towards CASTIEL, who is waiting at a table.]
CASTIEL
Oh, God.
[Kipling addresses the BARTENDER.]
KIPLING
Sweetie, fix me a coffee, black, and a Texas Trinity, necked, with some bark.
BARTENDER
Sure.
KIPLING
And for my friend...
CASTIEL
Water.
KIPLING
Water.
BARTENDER
All right.
[Kipling sits down.]
CASTIEL
What did you just order?
KIPLING
Oh, sausage and brisket, pork ribs, no sauce, well done. My apologies for the lingo, but when in Rome...
CASTIEL
I was surprised you wanted to meet here.
KIPLING
I’m surprised you wanted to meet at all. Didn’t think that you consorted with... my kind.
[Kipling removes his sunglasses. His eyes turn black.]
CASTIEL
Yes, well... I need information.
KIPLING
Of course you do.
CASTIEL
Does any demon know where Dean Winchester is?
KIPLING
I’m sorry, did you just say you lost a Winchester? Because, one -- that’s... interesting. And, two, how is that you lost Dean? I thought the two of you were joined at the...
[Kipling glances down in a suggestive way.]
...you know, everything.
[The bartender brings them their orders.]
KIPLING
Thank you, darling.
CASTIEL
Just answer the question.
KIPLING
You see, I could... (sips his drink) ...except, not to be crass, but what’s in it for moi?
CASTIEL
Your life.
KIPLING
Come again?
CASTIEL
I’ll speak slower...
KIPLING
Mm.
CASTIEL
...and you will tell me everything you know, or I will burn you to ash right here and right now.
KIPLING
I think we can do better.
CASTIEL
We?
[Kipling raises a finger. All the people in the bar stand up. They’re all DEMONS. Castiel stands up.]
KIPLING
We.
[Castiel gets his angel blade out. He tries to fight, but he’s outnumbered.]

ACT TWO
[EXT. ST. ANTHONY’S HOLY PARYS OF DULUTH - DAY]
[Establishing shot. Camera pans down to a sign: St. Anthony’s Holy Parish of Duluth. WELCOME SISTER JO.]
[Devotees are leaving the Church. A couple stops to talk to SISTER JO.]
MAN
You saved me, Sister.
SISTER JO
Thank you.
WOMAN
God bless you.
SISTER JO
He does, every day.
[EXT. STREET - NIGHT]
[Sister Jo is walking, counting the money she made. Suddenly, a flutter of WINGS.]
MICHAEL
Hey, Jo.
[Sister Jo stops in her tracks. She turns -- it’s Michael.]
SISTER JO
Who are you?
MICHAEL
You don't recognize me with this pretty face?
SISTER JO
You're not -- You're not Dean Winchester. You're...
[Sister Jo sees Michael’s true form.]
SISTER JO
(Inhales sharply) Oh, God.
MICHAEL
People keep calling me that.
[Sister Jo turns to walk away.]
MICHAEL
Ah, ah. We need to talk.
SISTER JO
You're the Archangel Michael, from another world, and you're possessing Dean Winchester.
MICHAEL
Sounds more complicated than it is.
SISTER JO
Why would he say “yes” to you?
MICHAEL
Love.
[Michael walks towards Sister Jo.]
SISTER JO
Really? (chuckles) That's very Hallmark Channel. So, I'm just gonna go now.
MICHAEL
No, you're not. Not until I ask you... what do you want?
SISTER JO
I don't know. Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton.
MICHAEL
You think this is a joke?
SISTER JO
I don't know what this is. You asked, I answered. We done?
MICHAEL
No. I asked, and you lied.
SISTER JO
I didn't.
MICHAEL
I know about you, Jo. Because he knew about you. You're the rebel, the angel who doesn't like playing by Heaven's rules or whatever. You pretend to care about these things -- pretty things. But that's all it is -- pretending.
These trinkets, they don't make you happy. They just pass the time. They're not what you really want.
SISTER JO
And if you're so smart, what do I really want?
MICHAEL
Love. To belong, to have a place -- a home, a family. It's very very human of you. And so, so disappointing.
I can sense how many angels are in this world. There aren't many left. I thought... maybe I could help. But if they're all these sad, lost, fallen things -- things like you -- maybe they're not worth saving, either.
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - JACK’S ROOM - DAY]
[Jack is sitting on his bed. A knock comes from the door. It’s Sam. He opens the door.]
SAM
Hey.
JACK
Hey.
SAM
I, uh... chatted with Bobby.
[Sam sits on the bed.]
SAM
He said you may have had a rough day today.
JACK
It was fine.
SAM
Okay. (pause) Jack I know this must be so hard. Without your grace, without your powers, it's a lot, I'm sure. But you can get past this. I know you will. I have faith in you, Jack. And I believe in you.
And --
[Mary walks in, interrupting them.]
MARY
Hey. Sam, um... he's awake.
SAM
(to Jack)
I have to, uh --
JACK
I know.
SAM
We'll talk later, all right?
[Jack nods. Sam pats the bed, stands up and leaves with Mary.]
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS]
[Sam and Mary head towards one of the rooms.]
SAM
Did he say anything?
MARY
I didn't talk to him. I can barely look at him.
SAM
Thanks.
[Mary leaves him alone. Sam slowly opens the door.]
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - NICK’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS]
[A MAN is sitting on the bed, his face mostly in shadow. Sam stares at his back for a while, takes a deep and shaky breath, and turns on the lights.]
[The man turns. It’s NICK, Lucifer’s vessel.]
NICK
Oh, hey, Sam.
SAM
Hey... Nick.
[FLASHBACK MONTAGE: Nick in his house right before he was possessed for the first time.]
SARAH/LUCIFER (O.S.)
Nick... Nick... I'm an angel. My name is Lucifer.
[FLASHBACK MONTAGE: we see scenes of Lucifer in Nick’s vessel.]
SARAH/LUCIFER (O.S.)
I need to take control of your mind and your body. Nick, I need you to say yes.
NICK
Then yes.
[END FLASHBACK]
SAM
How'd you sleep?
NICK
Uh, yeah. Um... Okay. I didn't wake up screaming, so that's a plus.
SAM
Yeah. So, no more nightmares?
NICK
They're getting better.
SAM
Good.
[Nick looks at Sam.]
SAM
May I, uh -- May I see it?
[Nick stands up. He unbuttons his shirt. He has a wound where Dean stabbed him. Sam prepares his tools to medicate it.]
SAM
Oh, look at that. Looks like it's healing.
[Nick scratches his wound.]
NICK
Yeah, it itches a lot. Doesn't really, uh --
[Sam disinfects the wound.]
NICK
-- hurt! Aah!
SAM
Sorry.
NICK
Ow. Ow. I don't get it. I don't understand how Lucifer could die and I could live.
SAM
Yeah, um... I think that maybe it's because the archangel blades were made to kill the archangel inside a-and not the person they, uh --
NICK
Possesses and uses to almost end the world twice?
SAM
Yeah. That.
NICK
It must be weird, you looking at me and seeing him.
SAM
Yeah. (pause) But... I'm really glad it's you. I'm glad Lucifer is dead.
NICK
Me, too.
SAM
You still, uh -- Y-You still remember --
NICK
Oh, I mean, just little bits and pieces here and there. Nothing -- Nothing about your brother.
SAM
Okay. And, uh, Michael? Did he tell Lucifer anything? Anything about his plan?
NICK
I mean, I remember him saying... he wanted to do it right this time.
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - CORRIDOR - LATER]
[Sam leaves Nick’s room. He closes the door, brings a hand to his forehead. His phone starts buzzing. Sam replies.]
SAM
Hey, Cas.
KIPLING (V.O.)
Hello, Sam.
[INT. MOTOWN’S BBQ MEATS - DAY]
[Kipling is holding Castiel captive and chained to a chair.]
SAM (V.O.)
Who is this?
KIPLING
Oh. I'm the boy who's got your angel. And if you want to see him again, you know, alive, we should probably chat.

ACT THREE
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - WAR ROOM - DAY]
[Sam is preparing some weapons to rescue Castiel, along with Bobby, Jack, Maggie and Mary.]
MARY
It's a trap.
SAM
Yep.
BOBBY
This guy's a --
SAM
Demon.
JACK
He just told you he was a demon?
SAM
Yeah. He seemed pretty proud of it, too.
BOBBY
Yeah, they ain't a real humble bunch.
MAGGIE
So, what do we do?
[Sam loads his gun.]
SAM
We get Cas back. All right, grab holy water, Devil's Trap bullets, angel blades, because whatever we're walking into --
BOBBY
It's gonna suck.
SAM
Exactly. Maggie, you're with Bobby. Mom, you're with me.
JACK
I'm coming, too. I know I'm not as strong as I used to be, but... I can help. (pause) I have to.
BOBBY
Listen, kid --
SAM
Okay. Grab your gear.
[Jack smiles at him and hurriedly leaves to prepare.]
BOBBY
Sam, I mean -- Jack's a worker, but he ain't ready for a full-on demon smackdown.
SAM
So... we keep an eye on him. He needs this, Bobby.
[Bobby leaves.]
[INT. MOTOWN’S BBQ MEATS - DAY]
[Kipling grabs a cup of coffee from the bar. Castiel is still chained to the chair, bloody from his previous fight with the demons.]
KIPLING
(to the bartender)
And danke, sweetie.
[Kipling sits next to Castiel.]
KIPLING
Castiel, you sure I can't get you anything hot and black?
CASTIEL
Coffee has no effect on me.
KIPLING
Hm. Me either. (sips his coffee) You know, not anymore, but it's like saltwater taffy or infants -- you know, I just like the taste.
CASTIEL
Why are you doing this?
KIPLING
I'm just trying to be a good host like Mother would have wanted.
CASTIEL
No, w--
[Castiel rattles his chains.]
Why are you using me as bait?
KIPLING
I mean, it's kind of what you're for, isn't it? And I need something... from Sam Winchester.
CASTIEL
You really think that he's gonna make a deal with you?
KIPLING
Oh, he's dealt with worse. You see, recently, I had a revelation.
You know, somebody asked me what it was that I wanted, and I realized that after 600 years as a demon walking the planet, destroying, drinking, defiling -- you know, the Three D's -- I didn't know.
So, I sat back, and I gave it a good think, and I realized exactly what I wanted.
CASTIEL
And what is it?
KIPLING
Everything.
[EXT. ROAD - NIGHT]
[We see the IMPALA speed down the road, followed by another car.]
[INT. IMPALA - NIGHT]
[Sam is driving. Mary is sitting shotgun.]
MARY
Sam, it's gonna be fine.
SAM
(scoffs)
Stop saying that, please.
MARY
What?
SAM
“It's gonna be fine,” that everything's gonna be fine, we're gonna find Dean, and --
MARY
We are.
SAM
You don't know that. (pause) Dean's gone, and we have no idea where he is or -- or if he's even still alive. You know, Michael could have... burned him out or... worse, and... (sighs)
MARY
I know. I know he's out there, scared and alone. I know. I know he might never come back. Never think I don't know that.
But -- I can't -- I have to think about the good, Sam, because, if I don't, I will drown in the bad. For Dean's sake, I can't do that. We can't do that.
[INT. BOBBY’S CAR - NIGHT]
[Bobby, Maggie and Jack are following right behind the Impala. Bobby glances at Jack.]
BOBBY
Listen, Jack. On the other side, you saved me and mine a dozen times.
Now, things may have changed, but... whatever happened -- whatever happens -- we got your back.
[EXT. MOTOWN’S BBQ MEATS - DAY]
[Sam, Mary, Bobby, Maggie and Jack arrive in the location where Castiel is being held captive. They get out of their cars. Sam hands Mary RUBY’S KNIFE.]
SAM
Here.
MARY
The Demon Killing Knife. Are you sure?
SAM
Yeah. They'll search me. It's safer with you. All right. You know what to do.
[Sam heads to the bar’s entrance.]
[INT. MOTOWN’S BBQ MEATS - CONTINUOUS]
[Sam cautiously walks into the local. Kipling smiles at him.]
KIPLING
Ladies and gentlemen, the great... Sam Winchester.
[A DEMON searches Sam. Kipling puts his drink down.]
KIPLING
I have heard so much about you. You are a damn legend, Sam -- a-an icon.
Th-The shoulders, the -- the hair. Mm-mm! You are my Beyoncé.
[Sam looks at Castiel.]
SAM
Cas, you okay?
KIPLING
Of course he is. I don't damage the merchandise.
CASTIEL
I'm more embarrassed than I am hurt.
SAM
(to Kipling)
And you are?
KIPLING
Kipling. Uh, “Kip” for short.
SAM
Cool. Kip. I'm here like you asked, so --
KIPLING
Yeah, you're here, but not exactly as I asked. You see, I told you to come alone. But...
[A group of demons have captured Jack and Maggie. They bring them in.]
DEMON
Found them outside. They didn't even put up a fight.
JACK
I'm sorry, Sam.
[One of the demons punches Jack in the stomach.]
KIPLING
It's fine. You... tried. But I'm gonna need a little bit more now, you know, not to... eat them. I-It's just, you know, late capitalism. You understand. So, Sam, let's make a deal.

ACT FOUR
[INT. MOTOWN’S BBQ MEATS - DAY]
SAM
You're looking to make a deal?
KIPLING
I'm a demon. That's how we do.
[Sam glances at Maggie and Jack.]
KIPLING
Please.
[Kipling sternly taps a stool next to him.]
Sit. No? Suit yourself, barbarian.
SAM
What do you want?
KIPLING
That is a very good question. What do I want? You know, I don't know if you're aware or not, Sam, but Hell's in a bit of a pickle, you know, with Crowley dead and Asmodeus Kentucky fried, which means --
SAM
I don't care.
KIPLING
Yes, you do. Or you will. You see, for the first time in a very long time, Hell is without a King. And that -- that's just not right.
So, I --
SAM
So, you volunteer.
KIPLING
Exactly.
SAM
Why are you telling me all this?
KIPLING
Because I want to work with you, Sam, not against you.
CASTIEL
And is that why you took me hostage?
KIPLING
It's exactly why you're still breathing. It gives me a chance to show Sam and friends that I can hurt them but choose not to.
You see, I want the Crowley Deal. I give you information, a spot of help every now and again, and in return, you choose to turn a blind eye to the crossroads deals, the demon-on-demon violence, et cetera.
SAM
We never gave Crowley that deal.
KIPLING
How exciting. Then I would be breaking new ground.
SAM
All right. You got some good lines, I'll give you that much, but you're no Crowley. I know that. And so do they.
KIPLING
Ouch! (laughs) Owie! I know that I'm not that ponce-y son of a bitch. You see, in life, I rode with Genghis Khan, and I burned half the world.
So, please, do you think that I like prancing around like this? Please.
[He menacingly approaches Sam.]
KIPLING
If I had it my way, I would eat your heart. But a King has an image to maintain. And I'm not afraid of you. But, they are.
[Kipling glances at the other demons.]
KIPLING
So, take the deal, Sam, before I stop trying to be Crowley and I show you who I really am. So, what do you say, darling?
SAM
No.
KIPLING
A-Are you sure, because I know things -- a-all sorts of things.
SAM
Yeah. So do I.
KIPLING
Like?
[Mary and Bobby break in. They start shooting, making the fire alarm go off. Everyone else seeks shelter. Mary throws Ruby’s Knife to Sam.]
MARY
Sam!
KIPLING
How smart.
[Sam and Kipling start fighting. Mary kills a demon with an angel blade. Jack and Maggie are hiding.]
JACK
(to Maggie)
Hey. Stay low.
[A couple of demons are beating up Bobby. Jack steps up.]
JACK
Hey! Get away from him.
BOBBY
Aw, balls.
[One of the demons punches Jack. Sam is still fighting with Kipling. Mary goes to Maggie, who’s still hiding.]
MARY
Take this.
[She gives Maggie her angel blade.]
MARY
You know how to use it?
MAGGIE
Uh, stab them with the pointy end?
MARY
Pretty much. Okay.
MAGGIE
Okay.
[Sam and Kipling keep fighting. Castiel watches. A demon attacks Mary and is almost winning, when -- Maggie stabs her in the back with the angel blade. They get attacked by another pair of demons. Meanwhile, a demon punches Jack K.O.]
[Kipling is about to overpower Sam. He takes Ruby’s knife.]
KIPLING
Cool.
[Sam exploits Kipling being distracted, grabs the knife and KILLS HIM.]
SAM
Enough!
[Everyone looks at him.]
There will be no new King of Hell. Not today. Not ever. And if anybody wants the job, you can come through me. Understood? (breathing heavily) So, what's it gonna be?
[All demons leave their vessels.]
SAM
That's what I thought.

ACT FIVE
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - DAY]
[Sam is sitting at the table, pressing a cold beer to his forehead. He’s having a phone conversation.]
SAM
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I -- No, I don't care. I -- Just keep looking. Yeah. Thanks.
CASTIEL
Who was that?
SAM
Uh, Ketch. (chuckles) He's in London searching for the Newton-Dee Hyperbolic Pulse Generator.
[Castiel sits down.]
CASTIEL
The what?
SAM
It's the -- It's the magic egg that kicked Lucifer out of the President.
I thought we could use it on Michael, but -- Ketch can't find it.
So, that's another dead end, which is just awesome.
CASTIEL
Sam, are you all right?
SAM
Yeah, I've been better. I've been worse. You?
CASTIEL
I'm -- I'm just sorry.
I should never have gone to those demons.
SAM
Cass, I -- No, I-I-I don't blame you. I... Honestly, I-I wish I'd have thought of it first. If it meant finding Dean, I-I'd work with -- I'd do anything.
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - KITCHEN - DAY]
[Mary and Bobby are having a beer together.]
MARY
Not bad today, old man.
BOBBY
You, too, sunshine.
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - BATHROOM - DAY]
[Jack is staring at himself in the mirror.]
CASTIEL
Hey, Jack.
JACK
I'm fine.
CASTIEL
You did well.
JACK
All I did was get punched in the face.
CASTIEL
Well, to be fair, we all got punched in the face.
JACK
That's not -- Before, when I had my powers, I-I could have done something, and --
CASTIEL
Jack. You don't -- You -- You don't have your powers. And you -- Your grace should regenerate in time, but until then --
JACK
I'm useless. I can't kill demons, I can't find Dean, and Michael is in our world, and I can't stop him. I can't do anything. I don't have anything.
CASTIEL
Oh, Jack, that's just not true. You've got me. You have all of us. You have your family.
And -- And we are going to find Dean and we are going to beat Michael and we're going to do it together. We -- Because that's what we do.
[Castiel leaves.]
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER - SAM’S ROOM - DAY]
[Sam gets into his room. He turns the light on and leaves his phone on the table. The phone starts vibrating: an incoming call. Sam picks up.]
SAM
Hello?
SISTER JO (V.O.)
Sam?
SAM
Jo?
[EXT. ROAD - DAY]
SISTER JO
Yeah. We have a problem.
[INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY]
[Michael is talking to a young man.]
MICHAEL
Now, you -- you know exactly what you want.
You don't pretend to want to help people or save the world.
Your want is pure and simple and clean.
And that's why you are worth saving.
That's why we are going to work so well together.
Because you -- you just want to eat.
