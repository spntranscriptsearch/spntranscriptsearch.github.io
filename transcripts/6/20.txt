TEASER
EXT. PARK

CASTIEL You know, I've...I've been here for a very long time. And I remember many things. (an ocean is shown) I remember being at a shoreline, watching a little grey fish heave itself up on the beach and an older brother saying, "don't step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish." I remember the Tower of Babel...All 37 feet of it, which I suppose was impressive at the time. (clips from old movies are shown) And when it fell, they howled 'divine wrath'. But come on - dried dung can only be stacked so high. I remember Cain and Abel...David and Goliath...Sodom and Gomorrah. And, of course, I remember the most remarkable event (clips from seasons 4 and 5 are shown) - remarkable because it never came to pass. It was averted by two boys, an old drunk and a fallen angel. The grand story. And we ripped up the ending and the rules...And destiny...leaving nothing but freedom and choice. Which is all well and good, except... Well, what if I've made the wrong choice? How am I supposed to know? I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me tell you my story. (Castiel looks directly at the camera) Let me tell you everything.

ACT I
INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

CASTIEL Hello, Dean. Are you all right?

DEAN Yeah, I'm...I'm fine. How are you?

CASTIEL Just wanted to check in.

DEAN So, any word on, uh, Satan Jr being alive?

CASTIEL I'm...looking, believe me. I just don't understand how Crowley could've tricked me.

DEAN Well, he's a tricky son of a bitch, that's how. Doesn't matter. But if he is up and kicking, then what does matter is finding him, ripping his head off, and shoving it up his ass.

CASTIEL What about you? Have you found anything?

DEAN No, nothing yet.

CASTIEL Where's Sam?

DEAN He's keeping busy. He's tracking a Djinn in Omaha as we speak. In fact, I'm heading out there right now to meet up with him.

CASTIEL Well, I'd come if I could.

DEAN Yeah, no, I-I get it. No worries. But, Cas, you'll call, right? If you get into real trouble?

INT. CROWLEY'S LAB

(Crowley is examining Eve's corpse. He also has a vampire shackled nearby)

CROWLEY Howdy, partner.

CASTIEL What have you found?

CROWLEY I've found a lot of things. For example...Eve's brain? Dead as a tinned kipper. And yet...(Crowley reaches inside Eve and pulls out a handful of eggs)For some reason...She keeps laying eggs. Watch this.(Crowley takes a poker and places it on Eve's brain. The vampire seizes violently) Chocula here feels every tickle.

CASTIEL What is that good for?

CROWLEY Apart from the obvious erotic value, you got me.

CASTIEL You said Eve could open the door to Purgatory.

CROWLEY Correct. I did. And I'm confident that she could have if she was still alive! Single best chance to get over the rainbow, and the Winchesters killed her!

CASTIEL It was unavoidable.

CROWLEY You screwed up, Cas. You let the hounds mangle the pheasant, and now I am up to my elbows in it.

CASTIEL What is your point?

CROWLEY The point is...You're distracted, and that makes me nervous.

CASTIEL I am holding up my end.

CROWLEY Ah, yes. But is that all you're holding? See...the stench of that Impala's all over your overcoat, Angel. I thought we'd agreed - no more nights out with the boys.

CASTIEL I spoke with Dean. I needed to know what they know.

CROWLEY About what? About me, maybe?'Cause I happen to have it on good authority that your two little pets are currently trying to hunt me down! Forgive me, but I think you might have a little conflict of interest here.

CASTIEL Crowley had a point, of course. My interest was conflicted. I still considered myself the Winchesters' guardian. After all...they taught me how to stand up...

(flashback to 'Swan Song':)

EXT. STULL CEMETERY

CASTIEL Hey! Assbutt! (Castiel throws a bottle of holy oil at Michael, and Michael burns)

MICHAEL Aaaaaaaahh!

CASTIEL What to stand for...And what generally happens to you when you do.

(Lucifer snaps his fingers and Castiel explodes. The camera closes in on some of the floating droplets of blood.)

CASTIEL I was...done. I was over. And then the most extraordinary thing happened. I was put back. (Castiel stands behind Dean, beaten bloody by Lucifer) And we had won. We stopped Armageddon. (Castiel heals Dean) But at a terrible cost. (Castiel heals Bobby)

(flashback to very end of 'Swan Song')

EXT. OUTSIDE OF LISA BRAEDEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

(Sam stands under the streetlight, which flickers and dies, watching Dean inside Lisa's house. Castiel watches Sam.)

CASTIEL And so I knew what I had to do next. Once again, I went to Harrow Hell, to free Sam from Lucifer's cage. It was nearly impossible, but I was so full of confidence, of mission. I see now that was arrogance...Hubris...Because, of course, I hadn't truly raised Sam -- not all of him.(flashback to 'Unforgiven': Sam is beating a cop unconscious; flashback to 'Live Free or Twi-Hard': Sam watches Dean being turned; flashback to 'Appointment in Samarra': Sam raises his dagger to stab Bobby) Sometimes we're lucky enough to be given a warning. (back in front of Lisa's house, Sam turns and walks away- directly past Castiel) This should have been mine.

INT. CROWLEY'S LAB

CROWLEY Please. I'm begging you, Castiel. Just kill the Winchesters.

CASTIEL No.

CROWLEY Fine. Then I'll do it myself.

CASTIEL If you kill them, I'll just bring them back again.

CROWLEY No, you won't. Not where I'll put 'em. Trust me.

CASTIEL I said...No. Don't worry about them.

CROWLEY Don't worry about -- what, like Lucifer didn't worry? Or Michael? Or Lilith or Alastair or Azazel didn't worry?! Am I the only game piece on the board who doesn't underestimate those denim-wrapped nightmares?!

CASTIEL Just find Purgatory. If you don't, we will both die again and again, until the end of time. The Winchesters won't get to you.

CROWLEY Let them get to me! I'll tear their friggin' hearts out!

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

(a demon, Redd, is strapped to a chair under the devil's trap on Bobby's ceiling)

BOBBY I got to tell you, Redd...for a filthy, lower-than-snake-spit Hellspawn, you seem to have turned yourself into a damn fine hunter. I don't know whether to kill you or kiss you.

REDD Oh, please, kill me.

BOBBY That was you that dug out that nest of vamps back in Swan Valley, wasn't it?

SAM That was nice work.

REDD Eight of 'em in one go, roped and tied.

BOBBY And then you brought them to Crowley, right?

REDD Read the papers, redneck. The king is dead.

(Bobby chuckles and tosses holy water on Redd's neck)

REDD Ugh! Nng!

BOBBY Crowley's alive. You prove it just by being, you poor, dumb jackass. Crowley's alive. His nets are still out. Except now he's using you schmucks to hunt his monsters.

REDD Up yours.

(Bobby turns to Sam and hods out his hand. Sam hands Bobby Ruby's knife. Dean enters and nodes towards Sam. Sam goes into the kitchen with him.)

BOBBY Redd...Where's Crowley? No? Nothing? Oh, okay, then. Here, hang on to this for a bit. (Bobby stabs Redd in the leg with Ruby's knife)

REDD Aaaaaaaaaaahh! Aaaaaaaaaaaahh!

SAM So, what'd you tell him?

DEAN Nothing. Just relax.

BOBBY What's the hubbub?

DEAN I saw Cas. He popped in on me about two hours back.

BOBBY What'd you tell him?

DEAN Nothing, all right? Told him we were on some crap monster hunt. He doesn't know that we're getting close to Crowley. You know, he's our friend...And we are lying to him through our teeth.

SAM Dean--

DEAN -so he burned the wrong bones. So Crowley tricked him.

BOBBY He's an angel.

DEAN He is the Balki Bartokomous of Heaven! He can make a mistake!

BOBBY Nobody's saying nothing yet.

DEAN You think that Cas is in with Crowley. Crowley?

BOBBY Look, I'm just saying I don't know. Now, look, I hate myself for even thinking it. But I don't know.

(Castiel is standing behind them, invisible.)

SAM Look, Dean, he's our friend, too, okay? And I'd die for him. I would, but...Look, I'm praying we're wrong here.

BOBBY But if we ain't...If there's a snowball of a snowball's chance here...that means we're dealing with a Superman who's gone dark side. Which means we've got to be cautious, we got to be smart, and maybe stock up on some Kryptonite.

DEAN (to Sam)This makes you Lois Lane.

BOBBY Look, one problem at a time here. We got to find Crowley now, before the damn fool cracks open Purgatory.

CASTIEL So - they already suspected.

BOBBY Where's Crowley?

REDD Up yours. Aaaaaaaaaaaaahh!

CASTIEL And the worst part was Dean, trying so hard to be loyal, with every instinct telling him otherwise.

REDD I don't know where Crowley is!

BOBBY Are you sure about that? 'Cause we can twist again all the way to next summer.

(Bobby twists Ruby's knife again)

REDD Oh, God! I never even met him! I don't deal with Crowley direct.

BOBBY Well, who do you deal with?

REDD The dispatcher. A demon named Ellsworth.

INT. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE

CASTIEL If there was a demon counterpart to Bobby Singer, Ellsworth would be it.

(Ellsworth sits at a desk, filled with phones of both the human and demonic variety)

ELLSWORTH No, listen to me. No. I don't care. I want you to get down to New Mexico and bag me that Wendigo! Hell. Hang on. What? No more vampires. Because the boss says we're done with them. (picking up one of the phones) FBI. Thomas speaking. Absolutely, I sent them. Thank you for calling to check. You too. Have a nice day, now. Bye-bye. (at the two demons about to exit) Hey, hey, hey! No! Not in here, you friggin' Yeti. Out back!

CASTIEL These demons would lead the Winchesters to Crowley, and Crowley would tear their hearts out.

(Castiel appears in Ellsworth's house and smites the two demons right in front of Ellsworth's desk)

ELLSWORTH Oh, hell.

(Ellsworth attempts to leave his host, but Castiel pushes him back in and smites him too)

CASTIEL I had no choice. I did it to protect the boys. Or to protect myself. I-I don't know anymore.

ACT II
INT. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE

(Dean and Bobby enter through the front door, Sam meets them inside the house)

SAM Hey. Clear from the back.

DEAN Demons get tipped and bugged out?

SAM Maybe they run from us now. I mean, that would be a nice thought, right?

BOBBY Yeah, if that's what happened.

SAM Yeah.

CASTIEL Hiding...Lying...Sweeping away evidence. And my motives used to be so pure. After supposedly "saving" Sam, I finally returned to heaven.

EXT. DROWNED MAN'S HEAVEN

CASTIEL Of course, there isn't one heaven. Each soul generates its own paradise. I favored the eternal Tuesday afternoon of an autistic man who drowned in a bathtub in 1953.

RACHEL You're alive.

CASTIEL Yes.

RACHEL Castiel, we saw Lucifer destroy you.

CASTIEL Well, I came back.

RACHEL But Lucifer? Michael?

CASTIEL They're gone.

RACHEL It was God, wasn't it?

CASTIEL No. It was the Winchesters. They brought down the Apocalypse.

RACHEL But you beat the Archangels, Castiel. God brought you back. He chose you, Cas...To lead us.

CASTIEL No. No one leads us anymore. We're all free to make our own choices and to choose our own fates.

RACHEL What does God want?

CASTIEL God wants you to have freedom.

RACHEL But what does he want us to do with it?

CASTIEL If I knew then what I know now...I might have said..."It's simple. Freedom is a length of rope. God wants you to hang yourself with it."

INT. KEN LAY'S HEAVEN

CASTIEL Those first weeks back in heaven were surprisingly difficult. Explaining freedom to angels is a bit like teaching poetry to fish. And then there was Raphael...

RAPHAEL You came. I appreciate the courage that takes.

CASTIEL Whose heaven is this?

RAPHAEL Ken Lay's. I'm borrowing it.

CASTIEL I still question his admittance here.

RAPHAEL He's devout. Trumps everything.

CASTIEL What do you want?

RAPHAEL Tomorrow - I've called for a full assembly of the Holy Host. You'll kneel before me and pledge allegiance to the flag, all right?

CASTIEL And what flag is that?

RAPHAEL Me, Castiel. Allegiance to me.

CASTIEL Are you joking?

RAPHAEL Do I look like I'm joking?

CASTIEL You never look like you're joking.

RAPHAEL You rebelled - against God, heaven, and me. Now you will atone. We'll start by freeing Lucifer and Michael from their cage. And then we'll get our show back on the road.

CASTIEL Raphael...No. The Apocalypse doesn't have to be fought!

RAPHAEL Of course it does. It's God's will.

CASTIEL How can you say that?!

RAPHAEL Because it's what I want.

CASTIEL Well, the other angels won't let you.

RAPHAEL Are you sure? You know better than anyone, Castiel. They're soldiers. They weren't built for freedom. They were built to follow.

CASTIEL Then I won't let you.

RAPHAEL Really? You?

(Raphael hits Castiel with power)

EXT. DROWNED MAN'S HEAVEN

CASTIEL I'm not ashamed to say that my big brother knocked me into next week.

RAPHAEL Tomorrow you kneel, Castiel...Or you and anyone with you dies.

INT. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE SAM Hey...The place is clean.

BOBBY Yeah, but it's...It's like "Mr. Clean" clean, you know? It's kind of OCD for your average demon.

SAM Yeah. So what now?

DEAN We'd call Cas.

SAM What?

DEAN This is usually the point where we would call Cas for help.

BOBBY We talked about this.

SAM Yeah, Dean.

DEAN No, you talked. I listened. This is Cas, guys. I mean, when there was no one...And we were stuck - and I mean really stuck - he broke ranks. He has gone to the mat cut and bleeding for us so many freakin' times. This is Cas! Don't we owe him the benefit of the doubt at least?

SAM Castiel...This is really important, okay? Um...We really need to talk to you.

DEAN Castiel...Come on in.

CASTIEL But I didn't go to them...Because I knew they would have questions I couldn't answer...Because I was afraid.

DEAN Cas is busy.

SAM That's all right. We are, too. Come on.

BOBBY Back to square one.

DEAN Great. Well, what do we do now?

BOBBY Well, we caught one hunter demon before. We can do it again.

SAM Dean!

(Dean is attacked by a demon, as are Sam and Bobby)

DEMON Crowley says "hi."

ACT III
INT. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE

CASTIEL Crowley sent his very best. I was caught as much by surprise as the rest of them. And it left me with yet another choice. I could reveal myself and smite the demons. Of course Crowley wouldn't like it. But on the other hand, they were my friends. (Castiel smites the demons attacking Dean, Sam and Bobby) For a brief moment...I was me again.

DEAN It is good to see you, Cas.

CASTIEL You all right?

SAM Yeah. Perfect timing, Cas.

CASTIEL I'm glad I found you. I come with news.

DEAN Yeah? What?

CASTIEL I firmly believe Crowley is alive.

DEAN Yeah. You think, Kojak? Well, Bobby, what do we think about Cas saving our asses...Again?

BOBBY I think we owe you an apology.

CASTIEL Why?

SAM We've been hunting Crowley this whole time...And keeping it from you.

BOBBY We thought...You were working with him.

CASTIEL You thought what?

DEAN I know. It's crazy, right?

BOBBY It's just that you torched the wrong bones. It doesn't matter. We - we were wrong.

CASTIEL You know...You could've just asked me.

DEAN And we should have. We never should've doubted you. It's...I just hope you can forgive us.

CASTIEL Wonders never cease. They trusted me again. But it was just another lie. It's forgotten.

DEAN Thanks.

SAM Yeah. Thanks, Cas.

CASTIEL It is a little absurd, though.

BOBBY I know, I know.

CASTIEL Superman going to the dark side. I'm still just Castiel.

DEAN I guess we can put away the Kryptonite, right?

CASTIEL Exactly. Of course, I didn't realize it at the time. But it was all over. Right then - just like that.

INT. CROWLEY'S LAB

CASTIEL You sent demons after them?

CROWLEY You kill my hunters. Why can't I kill yours?

CASTIEL They're my friends.

CROWLEY You can't have friends, not anymore. I mean, my God. You're losing it!

CASTIEL I'm fine.

CROWLEY Yeah. You're the very picture of mental health. Come on. You don't think I know what this is all about?

CASTIEL Enlighten me.

CROWLEY The big lie -- the Winchesters still buy it. The good Cas, the righteous Cas. And long as they still believe it, you get to believe it. Well, I got news for you, kitten. A whore is a whore is a whore.

(Castiel shoves Crowley against the wall)

CASTIEL I'm only gonna say this once. If you touch a hair on their heads, I will tear it all down. Our arrangement -- everything. I'm still an Angel, and I will bury you. (Castiel disappears) I asked myself, "what was I doing with this vermin?"

CROWLEY This is not how synergy works!

CASTIEL As if I didn't already know the answer.

EXT. DROWNED MAN'S HEAVEN

CASTIEL Raphael was stronger than me. I wouldn't survive a straight fight.

EXT. LISA BRAEDEN'S HOUSE

(Dean is raking leaves)

CASTIEL So I went to an old friend for help. But watching him, I stopped. Everything he sacrificed, and I was about to ask him for more.

CROWLEY Ah, Castiel. Angel of Thursday. Just not your day is it?

CASTIEL What are you doing here?

CROWLEY I want to help you help me help ourselves.

CASTIEL Speak plain.

CROWLEY I want to discuss a simple business transaction. That's all.

CASTIEL You want to make a deal? With me? I'm an Angel, you ass. I don't have a soul to sell.

CROWLEY But that's it, isn't it? It's all of it. It's the souls. It all comes down to the souls in the end, doesn't it?

CASTIEL What in the hell are you talking about?

CROWLEY I'm talking about Raphael's head on a pike. I'm talking about happy endings for all of us, with all possible entendres intended. Come on. Just a chat.

CASTIEL I have no interest in talking with you.

CROWLEY Why not? I'm very interesting. Come on. Hear me out. Five minutes. No obligations. I promise -- I'll make it worth your while.

CASTIEL I was no fool. I knew who Crowley was and what he did. But I was smarter than him, stronger. I see now that I was prideful. And in all likelihood, I was a fool.

INT. HELL

(Countless souls stand in line. The newest arrival takes number 6,611,527,124 from the take-a-number dispenser.)

CASTIEL Where are we?

CROWLEY You don't recognize it, do you? It's Hades, new and improved. I did it myself.

CASTIEL This is Hell?

CROWLEY Yeah. See, problem with the old place was most of the inmates were masochists already. A lot of "thank you, sir. Can I have another hot spike up the jacksie?" But just look at them. No one likes waiting in line.

CASTIEL And what happens when they reach the front?

CROWLEY Nothing. They go right back to the end again. That's efficiency.

CASTIEL You have four minutes left.

CROWLEY What are you planning to do about Raphael?

CASTIEL What can I do besides submit or die?

CROWLEY Submit or die? What are you, French? How about resist?

CASTIEL I'm not strong enough, and you know it.

CROWLEY Ah, not on your own, you're not. But you're not on your own, are you? There's a lot of angels swooning over you. "God's favorite." Buddy boy, you've got what they call sex appeal.

CASTIEL Thank you. Get to the point.

CROWLEY Angels need leaders, so be one. Gather your army and kick the candy out of each and every angel that shows up for Raphael.

CASTIEL Are you proposing that I start a civil war in heaven?

CROWLEY Ding! Ding! Ding! Tell him what he's won, Vanna.

CASTIEL You're asking me to be the next Lucifer.

CROWLEY Please. Lucifer was a petulant child with daddy issues. Cas, you love God. God loves you. He brought you back. Did it occur to you that maybe he did this so you could be the new sheriff upstairs?

CASTIEL This is ridiculous. I mean, the amount of power that it would take to mount a war...

CROWLEY More than either of us have ever seen, yeah. But what if I said I knew how to go nuclear?

CASTIEL What do you mean?

CROWLEY Purgatory, my fine feathered friend. Purgatory. Just think about it. An untapped oil well of every fanged, clawed soul. I mean, what's that over the years? 30 million? 40 million? Just sitting there, plump and rich for the taking.

CASTIEL How would you even find it when no one ever has?

CROWLEY We'll need expert help.

CASTIEL From whom?

CROWLEY From experts, of course. I know of two eerily suited 'Teen Beat' models with time on their hands.

CASTIEL No. Not Dean. He's retired, and he's to stay that way.

CROWLEY Fine. Then I know of a certain big, bald patriarch I can take off the bench. The point is...They can get us to the monsters. The monsters can get us to Purgatory. I know it.

CASTIEL And what's your price in all of this?

CROWLEY Just half.

CASTIEL Half?

CROWLEY My position isn't all that stable, ducky. Those souls would help, just like they'd help you. Besides, wouldn't you rather have me in charge down here? The devil you know...

CASTIEL This is pointless. Your plan would take months, and I need help now.

CROWLEY Granted. Yes. But just to show you how serious I am about this scheme...How about I float you a little loan? Say, 50 large? 50,000 souls from the pit. You can take them up to heaven. Make quite a showing. It's either this or the Apocalypse all over again. Everything you've worked for -- everything that Sam and Dean have worked for -- gone. You can save us, Castiel. God chose you to save us. And I think...Deep down...You know that.

CASTIEL I wish I could say I was clean of pride at that moment...

INT. KEN LAY'S HEAVEN

CASTIEL Or the next. (Castiel uses the power of the souls to remove Raphael from the room.) There will be no Apocalypse. And let it be known -- you're either with Raphael or you're with me. And so went the long road of good intentions...The road that brought me here.

INT. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE

DEAN Castiel, uh...We need you for a little powwow down here, so come on down.

CASTIEL Hello.

BOBBY Oh, Johnny on the spot.

CASTIEL You're still here.

SAM Yeah, we had to bury the bodies.

DEAN And we found a little whiskey. Thanks for coming.

CASTIEL How can I help?

SAM Oh, look. We, um - we have a new plan. We think we've finally figured out a way to track down Crowley.

CASTIEL What is it?

BOBBY (lights a match and drops it on the floor by Castiel's feet, trapping him in a ring of holy fire)It's you.

ACT IV
INT. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE

CASTIEL What are you doing?

DEAN We gotta talk.

CASTIEL About what? Let me go!

DEAN About Superman. And Kryptonite.

BOBBY How'd you know what I said?

SAM How long you been watching us?

DEAN You know who spies on people, Cas? Spies.

CASTIEL Okay, just wait. I don't even know what you mean.

SAM What about this demon craphole? How is it so, uh..."Next to godliness" clean in here?

BOBBY And how exactly did Crowley trick you with the wrong bones?

CASTIEL It's hard to understand. It's hard to explain. Just let me go. Let me out and I can -

DEAN You got to look at me, man. You got to level with me and tell me what's going on. Look me in the eye and tell me you're not working with Crowley. (Castiel looks at Dean, but then looks away) You son of a bitch.

CASTIEL Let me explain.

DEAN You're in it with him? You and Crowley have been going after Purgatory together? You have, huh? This whole time.

CASTIEL I did it to protect you. I did it to protect all of you.

SAM Protect us how? By opening a hole into monsterland!

BOBBY He's right, Cas. One drop got through, and it was Eve. And you want to break down the entire dam?

CASTIEL To get the souls. I can stop Raphael. Please, you have to trust me.

SAM Trust you?! How in the hell are we supposed to trust you now?

CASTIEL I'm still me. I'm still your friend. Sam...I'm the one who raised you from Perdition.

SAM What? Well, no offense...But you did a pretty piss-poor job of it. Wait. Did you bring me back soulless...On purpose?

CASTIEL How could you think that?

SAM Well, I'm thinking a lot of things right now, Cas.

CASTIEL Listen. Raphael will kill us all. He'll turn the world into a graveyard. I had no choice.

DEAN No, you had a choice. You just made the wrong one.

CASTIEL You don't understand. It's complicated.

DEAN No, actually, it's not, and you know that. Why else would you keep this whole thing a secret, huh, unless you knew that it was wrong? When crap like this comes around, we deal with it... Like we always have. What we don't do is we don't go out and make another deal with the Devil!

CASTIEL It sounds so simple when you say it like that. Where were you when I needed to hear it?

DEAN I was there. Where were you?

DEAN You should've come to us for help, Cas.

CASTIEL Maybe. (There is a loud sound of wind. A large cloud of demon-smoke approaches.) It's too late now. I can't turn back now. I can't.

DEAN It's not too late. Damn it, Cas! We can fix this!

CASTIEL Dean, it's not broken! Run. You have to run now! Run!

(Dean, Sam and Bobby run out the door.)

FINAL ACT
INT. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE

(Crowley enters)

CROWLEY My, my. Playing with fire again?

(Crowley snaps and puts out the flame)

CASTIEL If you touch the Winchesters...

CROWLEY Please. I heard you the first time. I promise -- nary a hair on their artfully tousled heads. Besides, I think they've proven my point for me. It's always your friends, isn't it, in the end? We try to change. We try to improve ourselves. It's always our friends who got to claw into our sides and hold us back. But you know what I see here? The new God (pointing at Castiel) and the new Devil, working together.

CASTIEL Enough. Stop talking. And get out of my sight.

CROWLEY Well...Glad I came. You're welcome, by the way. (Crowley heads for the door) You know the difference between you and me? I know what I am. What are you, Castiel? What exactly are you willing to do?

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CASTIEL Hello, Dean.

DEAN How'd you get in here?

CASTIEL The angel-proofing Bobby put up on the house -- he got a few things wrong.

DEAN Well, it's too bad we got to angel-proof in the first place, isn't it? Why are you here?

CASTIEL I want you to understand.

DEAN Oh, believe me, I get it. Blah, blah, Raphael, right?

CASTIEL I'm doing this for you, Dean. I'm doing this because of you.

DEAN Because of me. Yeah. You got to be kidding me.

CASTIEL You're the one who taught me that freedom and free will --

DEAN You're a freakin' child, you know that? Just because you can do what you want doesn't mean that you get to do whatever you want!

CASTIEL I know what I'm doing, Dean.

DEAN I'm not gonna logic you, okay? I'm saying don't...Just 'cause. I'm asking you not to. That's it.

CASTIEL I don't understand.

DEAN Look, next to Sam, you and Bobby are the closest things I have to family -- that you are like a brother to me. So, if I'm asking you not to do something...You got to trust me, man.

CASTIEL Or what?

DEAN Or I'll have to do what I have to do to stop you.

CASTIEL You can't, Dean. You're just a man. I'm an angel.

DEAN I don't know. I've taken some pretty big fish.

CASTIEL I'm sorry, Dean.

DEAN Well, I'm sorry, too, then.

EXT. PARK

CASTIEL So, that's everything. I believe it's what you would call a...Tragedy from the human perspective. But maybe the human perspective is...Limited. I don't know. That's why I'm asking you, Father. One last time. Am I doing the right thing? Am I on the right path? You have to tell me. You have to give me...A sign. Give me a sign. Because if you don't...I'm gonna ju-- I'm gonna do whatever I... Whatever I must.
