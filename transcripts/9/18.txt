TEASER


[The scene opens with record-needle static and hands typing on a typewriter "Fanfare-Rondeau" by Jean-Joseph Mouret plays in the background. The camera pulls back and we see it is METATRON sitting at the typewriter. He looks straight into the camera.]


METATRON

What makes a story work? Is it the plot, the characters, the text? The subtext? And who gives a story meaning? Is the writer? Or you?

Tonight, I thought I would tell you a little story and let you decide.


TITLE CARD [then it sucks back on itself and SUPERNATURAL is replaced by METATRON's name]

ACT ONE
[The scene opens with water turning on in the MoL shower. DEAN stands there under the spray and slowly drags his hands through his hair and over his eyes as the water pours over him. He then stands in front of the mirror and wipes away the steam. He looks into his own eyes for a second and sighs. His eyes then wander to his right arm and he rubs the Mark of Cain with his left hand.]


[SAM is talking on the phone while pouring over many files in the MoL library.]


SAM

Yeah. All right. Thanks, Carlos. Listen, you, uh, if you catch wind of any other demon activity, give me a holler, all right? Appreciate it.

[he sees DEAN enter]

Hey.


DEAN

Anything?


SAM

Yeah. A dozen demon-related cases, people without souls acting out, but...


DEAN

But no sign of Abaddon.


SAM

Right. Looks like she's vanished.


DEAN

Well, we just got to keep digging.


SAM

Right.

[noticing DEAN rubbing absentmindedly at the Mark of Cain on his arm]

You okay?


DEAN

Yeah. I'm fine. Let's get to work.


SAM

All right.


[Scene changes to a dark, underground factory. CASTIEL is walking down a corridor. He is trying to located a pulsing sound. He catches his jacket on something and tears it, but continues to search for the origin of the sound. He enters a room and there are bloodied bodies everywhere and on the wall is a sigil written in blood. He takes out his phone and takes a picture of it. But behind him someone is drawing an angel blade on him. He whips around and disarms a woman. She begs for her life.]


HANNAH

Please... please don't! Don't hurt me.


CASTIEL

I'm not gonna hurt you. It's okay. What's your name?


HANNAH

Hannah.


CASTIEL

H-Hannah, what happened here?


[HANNAH looks at the sigil and then back to CASTIEL]


CASTIEL

Yeah, I... I heard it, too. What was it?


HANNAH

I don't know. It, uh, it sounded familiar. It sounded like heaven. It's so strange down here. I, uh, followed the tone and found so many of my brothers and sisters had, as well. It felt safe here, and then the doors slammed shut and a strange angel arrived. He said he worked for the new God.


CASTIEL

For Metatron?


HANNAH

Mm-hmm. He made us an offer... join Metatron, fight for him, and those that did would one day be allowed to return to heaven.


CASTIEL

Return to heaven?


HANNAH

I didn't believe him, either. But he said he would take us home. Some angels joined him. My friends and I refused, and, uh...


CASTIEL

I'm sorry for your loss. For all our loss.


[CASTIEL reaches to HANNAH and heals her wounds]


HANNAH

You're Castiel, aren't you?


CASTIEL

Yes.


HANNAH

You took a stand against Bartholomew. Are you going to help us, lead us against Metatron?


CASTIEL

I'm no leader.


HANNAH

But you...


CASTIEL

I am no leader, Hannah. But I will find Metatron, and I make him pay.


HANNAH

Let me help you. Let us help you.


CASTIEL

You are safer away from me. Now, this angel who attacked you, what was his name?


[Immediately the scene changes to the Winchesters on the phone with CASTIEL]


SAM

Gadreel? Gadreel is working for Metatron? For how long?


CASTIEL [entering his hotel room]

I don't know.


DEAN

So, Metatron made Gadreel kill Kevin?


CASTIEL

It would explain a lot, and there have been no new prophets, which Metatron could have fixed to his advantage.


DEAN

And Gadreel said that angels are returning to heaven? How? I thought that the spell was irreversible.


SAM

That's what Crowley said. Look, let's just find Gadreel and... and beat some answers out of him.


CASTIEL

Yeah, here's something to start with that. Uh... Hold on, I'm, uh... Sending you a photo of the symbol that drew all the angels in.


SAM [opening up his computer]

Okay. Got it.


CASTIEL

It's acting as some kind of angel siren. I think it's a spell. The ingredients used to create it were very odd... Griffin feathers, bones of a fairy. I've never seen it before.


SAM

Yeah. Me, neither. All right. Let me see what I can find.


CASTIEL [looking at the honor bar fridge in the hotel room; mutters to himself]

"Honor bar." What's honorable about a miniature bar in a motel room?


DEAN [overhearing from the phone]

Everything.


CASTIEL [gently with a small smile]

How are you, Dean?


DEAN [in the same tone]

I'm fine, Cas. How 'bout you?


CASTIEL [whistfully]

I miss my wings. Life on the road... smells.


DEAN (chuckles)

Hmm.


SAM

Yeah. Listen, I got a match, and it's not from the lore... it's from police records. Looks like that symbol you found was spotted at a handful of crime scenes the last couple days, all multiple homicides.


CASTIEL

And where were these crime scenes?


SAM

Uh, Utah... Baker, Hill Valley.


CASTIEL

And I'm in Bishop's Falls, Utah.


SAM

Also looks like most of the crime scenes were in industrial areas.


CASTIEL [checking the maps on the wall]

Looks like Gadreel is heading north.


DEAN

What's the next big town?


CASTIEL

There are two. It could be Auburn or Ogden.


DEAN

All right, you take Auburn, we'll take Ogden... meet in the middle.


[They hang up and CASTIEL starts to files in his case when the electricity starts to short out and buzz. He pauses and looks around.]


[Back in the bunker]


DEAN

Didn't we work a case in Ogden?


SAM

Yeah. It was a... it was a witch situation, right?


DEAN

Yeah. There was that kid in town that helped us, wasn't there?


SAM

Yes. We should call him, see if he's still in business.


DEAN

Yeah. What was his name?


[Outside a store a car pulls up and a hooded figure walks in and addresses the man behind the counter, IAN.]


FIGURE

Good afternoon.


IAN

It's afternoon?


FIGURE

I wonder if I may procure from you the feathers of a Griffin.


IAN

Uh (chuckles) we got some off-the-menu items, but, uh, this ain't Diagon Alley, man.


[The hooded figure pulls back his hood and it is revealed to be GADREEL]


GADREEL

I saw the Hunter signs on the door, young man. You have what I seek.


IAN

Griffin feathers, huh? Not exactly looking to trip the light fantastic, are we?


GADREEL

Humans never cease to amaze me.


IAN

Excuse me?


GADREEL

I'm curious... do you also have fairy bones? It does not matter what realm they were from.


IAN

Griffins and fairies... the hell you hunting, man?


GADREEL

Family.


IAN

Mm-kay. Let me see what we have here.


[Back in CASTIEL's hotel room he his getting ready to leave with the electricity starts to flash again. The TV pops on and starts to play CASA EROTICA 14. In the video a WOMAN speaks "Sometimes, you need a break from the hustle and bustle of city life. #amiright Sometimes, you need #casaerotica. Casa erotica."]


CASTIEL

That's inappropriate.


[In the video there is a knock at the door. The woman gets up and answers the door. It is GABRIEL (with a porn-stache.) "Hello. Remember me, bucko? (rips the porn-stache off] Gabriel. I'm gonna take that as a yes." He snaps his fingers and the TV goes black. CASTIEL slowly turns around and GABRIEL stands behind him.]


GABRIEL

I need your help, brother.


ACT TWO
CASTIEL

I thought you were dead.


GABRIEL

Please. You can't take the trick out of the Trickster.


CASTIEL

So, I assume you faked your own death?


GABRIEL

And I assume you weren't let into Mensa while I was gone.


CASTIEL

Where have you been?


GABRIEL

Ohhh, you know hither with a side of yon. I was hiding, captain side eyes, in the safest place in the universe... heaven. But then you and the other two stooges had to go and ruin Christmas, now, didn't you?


CASTIEL

Sorry.


GABRIEL

Oh, cry me a river. Look... I dropped, I hid, I finally watched "Downton Abbey." But then, your BFF, Metatron, sent his minions out looking for me. Apparently, he thinks since I'm an archangel that I have extra juice.


CASTIEL

And that you're a threat?


GABRIEL

Yeah, but I got hurt in the fall, too, used most of my juice to get back into porn. (pause) That came out wrong. So did that. Uh, the point is, I've been on the run. But then, a few weeks ago, somebody started playing my song.


CASTIEL

The angel siren.


GABRIEL

No. The horn of Gabriel... one of Dad's little party favors that I never got around to messing with. Metatron dug it up and started blowing, so I came out of hiding.


CASTIEL

Why?


GABRIEL

There's safety in numbers. But Metatron was using it to trap angels, not unite them.


CASTIEL

It wasn't Metatron. It was his second in command...Gadreel.


GABRIEL

Gadreel? That old Chestnut? Wow!


CASTIEL

What do you want from me?


GABRIEL

Your help, Columbo. I'm getting the band back together. We're going on the kill Metatron tour, and you're looking at the new front man.


[Scene changes to the IMPALA pulling up in front of IAN's shop at night. SAM and DEAN get out and enter. They search around with flashlights


DEAN

Got an open box of feathers over here.


[SAM opens a closet and IAN is dead inside, his eyes angel-burned from his head]


SAM

Dean.


DEAN

We got to find Gadreel before he lights up the bat signal.


[CASTIEL and GABRIEL are driving and CASTIEL is trying to call DEAN "This is Dean's other, other cell, so you must know what to do. *Beep*"]


CASTIEL

Dean, it's me. I'm...


GABRIEL [snatching the phone from CAS' hand]

Ho, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hands-free much? Both on the wheel. I'm precious cargo.

[Into the phone]

Hey, what's up, shorties? Remember me, the guy who died for your sins? No, not the cat with the beard and sandals... the hot one. Hey, thank you so much for the flowers and condolences... really meant a lot to the fam. Any old how, your boy toy and I are rolling our way towards your top-secret domicile. Ooh! Call to discuss.

[he hangs up]

Those kooky kids.


CASTIEL

So, you've been back for months. What have you seen out there?


GABRIEL

After it was raining winged men, hallelujah? Well, you know... total nigh-biblical chaos, Crowley and Aba-douche duking it out. Good times. And then there's our peeps, scattered like confetti.


CASTIEL

There has been a lot of confusion.


GABRIEL

You think? Most angels aren't like us, Castiel. They can't handle this whole free-will thing. They're sheep, drones. But us? We're different. We're rebels... one without a 'cause, one with.


CASTIEL

I'm just a soldier.


GABRIEL

Bitch, please. You've been God more often than Dad has.


CASTIEL (Chuckling)

Yeah. Look how that worked out.


GABRIEL

Well, go ahead. Be a soldier all you want. I'm gonna need as many as I can find.


CASTIEL

Why are you doing this, Gabriel?


GABRIEL

I always run...From Dad, from the family. I don't want to run anymore. I want to do what I was meant to do... lead.


CASTIEL

Well, we need a leader. And I'm happy it's gonna be you.


GABRIEL [looking guiltily out the window]

A little low on gas, aren't we?


[They pull up to a Gas-n-Sip and enter the station]


GABREIL

Ooh, smell that cancer. Delicious!

[Suddenly a truck pulls up outside and people jump off and approach the door]

Uh... Remember the minions of Metatron I mentioned?


[GABRIEL runs to the door and locks it. Suspenseful music plays as the camera changes to GADREEL walking to his car in a dark alley. But he looks up to see SAM walking around a corner, apparently having no idea GADREEL is there. SAM takes out his phone and calls]


SAM

Cas, it's Sam again. Call us. We need your help.


[He hangs up and then jumps as GADREEL is right in front of him. GADREEL smiles menacingly. But before he can make a move a lighter clicks open and DEAN drops it from above igniting a ring of holy fire around GADREEL.]


DEAN

Hey, douchebag.


SAM [in pure anger]

Remember me?


[Back at the Gas-n-Sip, CASTIEL and GABRIEL are working on a battle plan]


GABRIEL

We'll never keep these guys out of here.


CASTIEL

I know. So... We fight.


GABRIEL

No. I fight. I lied before. I never watched "Downton Abbey." I was just trying to fit in. Oh, and I do have some archangel juice left. I can hold these boneheads off long enough.


CASTIEL

Long enough for what?


GABRIEL

For you to get out of here.


CASTIEL

No, I'm not leaving you.


GABRIEL

Yes, you are.


CASTIEL

Those guys will cut you to ribbons.


GABRIEL

But I can stall them long enough for you to amscray. And you can take my place.


CASTIEL

What are you talking about?


GABRIEL

The angels need a leader, and it's got to be somebody like us... somebody different.


CASTIEL

No.


GABRIEL

I know you don't want this burden, Castiel. Neither do I.


CASTIEL

What if I fail again?


GABRIEL

You won't. You can't.


CASTIEL [suddenly pulls GABRIEL into a hug]

Thank you.


GABRIEL [hugging him back]

Shut up.


[CASTIEL turns to leave and as he does he goes to put his drawn angel blade into his coat but notices that it is no longer torn from earlier. He turns back around, suddenly suspicious.]


GABRIEL

Haven't got all day, hotpants.


CASTIEL

Was any of this real?


GABRIEL

What the hell are you talking about? Cas, go!

[CAS doesn't move]

So, what...we both die here?


CASTIEL [sadly sliding his blade into GABRIEL and it does nothing]

No. You're already dead.


GABRIEL

Well.

[snaps his fingers and the minions bursting in the door disappear]

What gave it all away?


CASTIEL

My coat was torn earlier today.


GABRIEL

Ah, crap. I really hate continuity errors.


CASTIEL

So, none of this is real, and I'm guessing I'm no longer in the motel.


GABRIEL

Here's the thing... none of it was real, but all of it was true.


CASTIEL

Whose truth...yours or Metatron's?


GABRIEL

Just hear him out, would you? He's just trying to help you.


CASTIEL [not believing a word of it]

Really? How?


GABRIEL

Sorry... didn't read the whole script, just, uh, skimmed for my parts. Well, it's good to see you, old bean.


[GABRIEL goes to snap his fingers but CASTIEL stops him]


CASTIEL

Wait. Are you dead?


[GABRIEL smirks and snaps his fingers. Everything disappears and CASTIEL is gagged and tied to a chair in METATRON's study. METATRON is still typing. He looks up and takes his glasses off smiling at CASTIEL.]


METATRON

What makes a story work?


ACT THREE
[In the abandoned factory, SAM and DEAN have GADREEL tied up to a chair.]


GADREEL [addressing SAM]

If this is like looking into a fun-house mirror for me, I cannot imagine what it is like for you.


SAM [barely controlling his rage]

How long have you been working for Metatron?


METATRON

I will not talk, and you cannot make me.


SAM

Yeah?


GADREEL

I have been you, Sam Winchester. Your insides reek of shame and weakness.


[SAM jumps forward and punches GADREEL in the face. He goes to do it again but DEAN jumps in front and presses his hands to his chest to stop him.]


DEAN

Sam, Sam, Sam! Sam. Come here.


[Back in METATRON's study he is addressing the camera again]


METATRON

Tonight, I thought I'd tell you a little story...Let you decide. That was my plan, anyway. I guess that's where my story failed.

[he stops the music and removes CASTIEL's gag. He then pulls back CASTIEL's coat and looks at the torn pocket.]

Yes. This is "The Curious Incident," eh, inspector Gregory?


CASTIEL

Who?


METATRON

Inspector Gregory. Sherlock Holmes. "Silver Blaze"?

[He rolls his eyes, exasperated]

You have been around since scaly things crawled out of the muck. Would it have killed you to pick up a book, watch a movie? [sighs] Here. I know it's a bit of a retcon, but it's gonna make this whole conversation a lot easier.

[He presses his fingers to CASTIEL's head and CAS reels back and gasps in pain]

I just gave you every book, movie, and TV show I have consumed in the last couple of millennia. Now do you understand that "the universe is made up of stories, not atoms"?


CASTIEL [still a little confused]

I understand that that's a... a quote by Muriel Rukeyser.


METATRON

Ah! It can be taught. Here are a few more lessons. First rule of writers club... steal from the best. Second rule? Every hero needs a villain.


CASTIEL

What are you talking you about?


METATRON

Hannah and her sisters...I set all that up, told Gadreel, "slaughter all those who will not join my army, but let one live, one...To tell the tale."


CASTIEL

Is it true? Can you bring angels back to heaven?


METATRON [chuckles]

Sorry. No spoilers. And you keep missing the point. You're supposed to lead the angels.


CASTIEL

I am not a leader, Metatron.


METATRON

Apparently. So... I did my homework.

[He picks up one of the books from the desk. It is Tall Tales by Carver Edlund.]

"The Winchester Gospels." Pulpy stuff.

[He throws the book into the fire in the fireplace]

Gave me an idea, though. You needed to be taught a lesson, and nobody teaches lessons better than good old Gabriel, a.k.a. The Trickster. So... I started typing.


CASTIEL

And you did all this to make me a hero?


METATRON [laughing]

Ah, that's priceless. Um no. You are not the hero in this mess-terpiece. You are the villain. I'm the hero.


[Back in the abandoned factory, SAM and DEAN are discussing their next play a few steps away from GADREEL.]


DEAN

He's not gonna crack that fast.


SAM

I know. Maybe you could hack him like you and Crowley hacked me.


DEAN

No, no, no, no. Crowley's the only one who can do that. And I'm in no mood to call that dickbag. We need Cas.


SAM

Any word from him?


DEAN

No. I tried him again. He hasn't called, he hasn't texted. I turned on the GPS on his phone. He's still in the same town where we talked to him last.


SAM

What the hell?


DEAN

I don't know. You got to go find him.


SAM

Wait, what?


DEAN

You're too close to this, man.


SAM

And, what, you're not?


DEAN

We're not at this five minutes, you're already going Liam Neeson on his ass. I got this.


[SAM nods and takes off. DEAN walks back over to GADREEL]


GADREEL

So, he acts tough, and you show kindness. Is that how this works?


DEAN [his eyes scarily dark]

No.

See, I don't care whether you talk. You're gonna pay for what you did to him...and Kevin.


[Back in METATRON's lair]


METATRON

Do you know why I didn't kill you after I stole your Grace? I like you. Truly. Among all God's little windup toys, you were the only one with any spunk. I left you human because I was hoping you would live happily ever after, but you screwed that up, too. And now... Uh, you leave me no choice. I mean, if you want to get back on board, fine, but you're gonna have to follow my script.


CASTIEL

Well, based on your assessment, that doesn't sound like me.


METATRON

Lead the dumb, disenfranchised, rebellious angels against me, Castiel. They will follow you. And they'll all die, but I'm gonna save a nice, warm seat up top for you. You will be saved.


CASTIEL

No.


METATRON

Mm. You're gonna make me do the hard pitch, aren't you? How's that, um, stolen grace inside you working out?


CASTIEL

It's fine.


METATRON

No. It's not. It's burning out. It's gonna burn you out. But I will give you an endless supply of rechargeable batteries. Deal?


[The door opens and a woman walks in]


WOMAN

Sorry to interrupt your writing session, sir, but something's happened.


METATRON

What's wrong?


WOMAN

It's Gadreel.


[Scene switchs to DEAN drawing his angel blade deeply across GADREEL's arm. GADREEL screams in agony.]


DEAN [loudly as he cleans the blood off his blade]

Word around the campfire is, you let the snake into the garden, ruined it for all humanity.


GADREEL [gasping]

I set them free. I loved humanity!


DEAN

Well, you sure got got a funny way of showing it, asshat. Now, look, you tell me about this "getting back into heaven" crap and I'll end this quick. Otherwise, you can sit here and rot in those chains forever. Up to you.


GADREEL

All your talk, all your bluster... you think you are invincible. The two of you against the world, right?


DEAN [turning his back on GADREEL]

Damn straight.


GADREEL

You really think Sam would do anything for you?


[DEAN's face is completely broken but his walls come up again as he turns back to face GADREEL]


DEAN

Oh, I know he would.


GADREEL

I have been in your brother's body, Dean. He would not trade his life for yours.


DEAN

Well, thanks for the rerun, pal. Sam's already told me all that crap. Hell, he's told me worse.


GADREEL

He told you that he has always felt that way,

[DEAN stares blankly at him]

that he thinks you are just a scared little boy who's afraid to be on his own because daddy never loved him enough? And he is right, isn't he? Right to think you are a coward, a sad, clingy, needy...


[DEAN's fist crashed into GADREEL's face and his mouth bleeds profusely]


DEAN

Keep it up!


GADREEL

Pathetic bottom-feeder who cannot even take care of himself, who would rather drag everyone through the mud than be alone, who would let everyone around him die!


[DEAN can't take it anymore and swings his angel blade to stap GADREEL in the chest. But just before he reaches him, he notices GADREEL has his eyes close waiting for the death strike. DEAN stops in an instant]


GADREEL [opens his eyes in a panic]

No. Do it. Do it! Kill me!


DEAN [icily]

Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? That's what that whole speech was about? You're not afraid to die, are you? You're afraid to be left in these chains forever. Well, you can sit here and rot, you son of bitch.


ACT FOUR
[SAM pulls up to CASTIEL's hotel and gets out and enters CAS' room. DEAN enters the filthy restroom in the factory. SAM looks around the room and sees CASTIEL's phone on the table. DEAN sets his cell down on the sink and splashes water on his face. He looks up into the mirror and stares at the reflection of the Mark of Cain. SAM picks up CASTIEL's phone and notes there are 6 missed calls from DEAN. SAM suddenly hears someone behind him and he draws his gun and turns in a second.]


METATRON

Easy there, tiger. I'm here to trade. You have something of mine, and I have something of yours. Bring him here tomorrow, say...6:00-ish? If not, Castiel dies. No comebacks this time.


SAM

An even trade?


METATRON

I'm an entity of my word.


[DEAN's phone vibrates on the sink as SAM tries to reach him but DEAN is grasping his right arm, holding the angel blade and headed back to GADREEL.]


[The IMPALA pulls up to the factory. SAM enters the room where GADREEL was tied up but the chair is overturned and there is a lot of blood pooling on the floor.]


SAM

Dean? Dean!

[SAM looks around wildly and notices his brother on the other side of the room, propped against the wall looking unconscious. SAM rushes to him as we can see DEAN stir.]

Dean. Hey! Are... are you okay?


[DEAN's right hand is all bloody]


DEAN

Yeah. Yeah, you got to stop asking me that.


SAM

I've been calling you. I mean, w-why didn't you, uh...


[The camera pan to GADREEL who is lying by DEAN very bloody and unconscious.]


DEAN

He won't talk.


SAM

I figured.


DEAN [looking desperately at SAM]

He wanted to die, and I was gonna kill him. I was. But then I stopped 'cause I know we need him to talk.


SAM

Dean, listen. Metatron has Cas. He's offering up a trade.


DEAN

We can't trust Metatron.


SAM

I-I know that. Obviously. But look, this is the first time we're gonna know for sure where Metatron is. Let's take Gadreel to the meet-up, make the exchange, and then trap Metatron.


[Back at CASTIEL's hotel, the Winchesters wait next to the IMPALA]


SAM

He's late.


DEAN

Or he's not gonna show.


METATRON [appearing]

Of course I'm gonna show. I was just waiting for you two to finished setting up your little trap for me. Uh... Am I hitting my mark? Well, come on. Let's go. I'm waiting.


[DEAN throws down a lit lighter and it lights up a burning holy fire circle around METATRON. He fakes agony and then laughs]


METATRON

Either of you bring s'mores? Holy Fire always gives them a delightful minty aftertaste. Make a wish, boys.


[METATRON blows out the holy flames with a breath. The Winchesters jump forward with their angel blades but METATRON sends them flying back into the IMPALA with a flick of his wrist.]


METATRON

No, thanks!


[He walks to the IMPALA's trunk and opens it. He flicks away the angel warding]


METATRON

Bye-bye.


[GADREEL gets out of the trunk as a car pulls up and CASTIEL gets out. He quickly walks over to the Winchesters.]


METATRON

Well, a deal is a deal.


DEAN

Why are you doing this?


METATRON

Because I can. Because you and your little brother and your fine, feathered friend and all those secrets you've got locked away in your bunker can't stop me. But I am gonna enjoy watching you try. It's gonna be a hell of a show. I'll see you around, Castiel. Never forget I gave you a chance.


ACT FIVE
DEAN

Somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on here?


CASTIEL

Metatron is trying to play God.


SAM

Play God? Cas, he erased angel warding. He friggin' blew out Holy Fire. He is God. He's powering up with the angel tablet. How the hell are we supposed to stop this guy?


DEAN

All right, so what if there is a stairway to heaven? We find it and get a drop on the guy.


SAM

You want to sneak onto the Death Star, take out the emperor?


CASTIEL

Okay I... I'm not sure what a fictional battle station in space has to do with this, but if taking out the emperor means taking out Metatron, I'm on board.


DEAN [exchanging confused looks with SAM]

Wait, did you... did you just understand a Death Star reference?


CASTIEL

Yeah, I think so. But I don't understand what that has to do with heaven.


SAM

It's halfway, I guess.


DEAN

You sure you're all right?


CASTIEL

Yes. Are you? There's something different about you.


DEAN [pats CASTIEL on the shoulder with his right hand]

I'm fine.


[CASTIEL grabs his arm and pushes up his sleeve revealing the Mark. CASTIEL's eyes darken as his stares at DEAN]


CASTIEL

What have you done?


DEAN [yanks his hand back]

It's a means to an end.


CASTIEL

Damn it, Dean.


DEAN

Look, you find heaven, you drop a dime. Meantime, I got a knight to kill.


[DEAN stomps to the driver's side of the car.]


SAM [to CASTIEL]

Be safe out there. You, too. Hey, Sam. You keep an eye on him.


[GADREEL enters METATRON's lair]


METATRON

Is the door secure?


GADREEL

Yes. The way home is safe.


METATRON

Thank you, Gadreel.


GADREEL

How did your play turn out?


METATRON

Didn't quite turn out as I'd planned, but that is why we rewrite. That was God's problem, you know... he published the first draft. You got to keep at it till you get all your ducks in a row.


GADREEL

Was the Winchesters grabbing me part of your plan?


METATRON

That was a surprise. But, hey, what writer doesn't love a good twist? My job is to set up interesting characters and see where they lead me. The by-product of having well-drawn characters is...They may surprise you. But I know something they don't know...the ending. How I get there doesn't matter as long as everybody plays their part.
