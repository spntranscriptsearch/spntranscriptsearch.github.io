NOW
INT. MEN OF LETTERS BUNKER – MAP ROOM


SAM supports JACK as they rush from the hallway to the map room. He grabs a chair and helps Jack into it. DEAN and CASTIEL follow close behind.


SAM
I got you. Let's get you a seat.


CASTIEL
Jack, deep breaths. Just try to focus. Try to slow this down if you can.


DEAN
What do we do? What do we do?!


SAM
I don't know.


JACK
You have to let me go. Just... Just get outside. I'll try to get as far away as I can.


CASTIEL
No, Jack.


JACK
NO! Leave me. I can't stop this. I'm coming apart. I don't want to hurt you. Don't let me hurt you.


DEAN
Hey, hey, hey, we're not giving up on you, okay? (to Sam) Uh... magic. Magic. One of Rowena's spells. Come on, we've got to do something!


BILLIE
I think you've done enough.


The group looks over in surprise to where Billie has suddenly arrived, holding her scythe.


BILLIE
We were so close.


DEAN
Chuck saw it coming. All of it. Your whole plan.


SAM
It was doomed.


BILLIE
Because of you. It was doomed because of' you.


CASTIEL
You led Jack through his trials. You know what's happening to him. You can stop this. Please.


BILLIE
I can't stop it.


Billie waives her hand and Jack's chair turns around towards her. He is still panting, doubled over in pain.


BILLIE
But there is something I can do.


She lifts Jack's chin. The light cracking the skin around his eyes is spreading down his cheeks. Suddenly, he vanishes. Billie's empty hand falls.


DEAN
What'd you do? What did you do?!


EXT. THE EMPTY


The light continues expanding brighter around Jack's glowing yellow eyes as he looks around at the blackness of The Empty.


JACK
Billie?


COSMIC ENTITY
Hey, kid. How'd you get in here?


The Cosmic Entity, appearing now as Meg like it had to Sam and Castiel, addresses Jack from a chair. Jack can't answer. He pants in pain.


COSMIC ENTITY
Heh, you're not looking so hot.


JACK
(strained) I'm sorry.


COSMIC ENTITY
Oh, s–


Jack screams, then explodes in a burst of yellow light.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT I
INT. MEN OF LETTERS BUNKER – MAP ROOM


DEAN, SAM, CASTIEL, and BILLIE are still gathered around the empty chair where Jack once sat.


DEAN
Billie, where the hell is he?!


BILLIE
The Empty.


CASTIEL
What?


BILLIE
Jack was a bomb designed to annihilate cosmic forces. Chuck and Amara are gone. The Empty was the only player on the board who could possibly absorb that impact.


CASTIEL
So it's done.


BILLIE
It's done.


Dean and Sam both take in this information, that the bomb in Jack went off, and look down solemnly.


CASTIEL
Is he dead?


BILLIE
Maybe.


DEAN
You said this was a suicide mission.


BILLIE
No, I said taking out Chuck and Amara would be fatal.


CASTIEL
(realizing) It's a chain reaction.


BILLIE
Mm-hm. The Empty? It's different. Not as strong as Chuck or Amara, but... Vast.


Cut to Sam and Castiel who realize now that there's a chance that Jack is still alive.


BILLIE
But if Jack survives, and if The Empty survives? It's gonna be pissed.


SAM
Okay, so The Empty is pissed. What does that mean?


BILLIE
The Empty is strong. It's got beef with me, especially after what I just did.


DEAN
Oh, well, poor you.


BILLIE
(unimpressed) Good thing it can't reach me here.


SAM
Yeah, The Empty can't come to Earth. Not without being summoned.


DEAN
Wait, what about Jack? If he's alive?


CASTIEL
You have to bring him back.


BILLIE
Not until I get what I came for. (to Sam) Yeah, Sam. You took something that belongs to me. God's book.


SAM
You were always gonna betray us. Once you defeated God, you were gonna take power. That means everyone who got a free pass, or a second chance, everyone who was resurrected or came from another world, you were gonna kill them all. Dean and me, too. That's the order you want restored. That's always been your endgame.


BILLIE
Ya got me.


Castiel
You lied to everyone. Even The Empty. You promised it peace and quiet, but you never meant it.


SAM
Even if I give you the book, what's to stop you from stabbing us in the back, killing us all?


BILLIE
Nothing. But you don't have a choice. This isn't a negotiation. If he's alive, he won't last long. So if you want Jack, you'll give it to me now.


Cut to The Empty. Jack inhales deeply, realizing that he's still alive, confused about how. He looks at his hands while The Empty begins writhing beneath them, black goo reforming itself into the guise of Meg once again. The Empty is pissed.


COSMIC ENTITY
(to Jack, accusing) You...


Cut back to the Bunker. Sam enters the map room where Dean, Castiel, and Billie are waiting. Billie sets her scythe against the map table and holds out her hand. Sam drops God's book on the table and walks past her to rejoin the others. Billie picks up the book and opens it, flips to the end.


CASTIEL
What are you doing?


BILLIE
Since you ruined the last one, God's book has a new ending.


DEAN
Jack, now. ...Billie, I swear–


BILLIE
Shh.


Billie reads the page and smiles while the others look on in silence, unaware of what the book says. Cut to The Empty.


COSMIC ENTITY
(Angrily to Jack, in tears) You did this!


The Cosmic Entity holds out its hand and squeezes. Jack is pulled towards it. It grabs Jack's face in its hands.


COSMIC ENTITY
You made it loud!


Cut to The Bunker. Billie closes God's book, still smiling.


BILLIE
Interesting.


Cut back to The Empty. The Cosmic Entity squeezes Jack's head in its hands, tears still running down its face. Jack shakes in pain... then vanishes in a flash of light. The Cosmic Entity is shocked. It screams in frustration.


Cut to The Bunker, where Jack lands on the floor, startled. The boys move towards him, but they're blocked by Billie, who still holds God's book.


CASTIEL
Jack!


BILLIE
Nuh-uh. The boy's mine.


JACK
No.


BILLIE
(turning to Jack) Sorry, kid. You're still useful.


SAM
No, you can't!


BILLIE
I can and I will. Goodbye, boys.


As Billie turns, Dean makes a break for the table and grabs Death's scythe. He swings it at Billie. She dodges but not quickly enough; the blade hits her in the left shoulder. She drops God's book. She gestures forcefully at Dean. Dean goes flying across the room. The scythe drops. Billie clutches at the injury to her shoulder and vanishes. Jack collapses, and Sam and Castiel rush to his side.


CASTIEL
Jack! ...Jack?


Castiel squeeze Jack's shoulder. Jack is panting, in shock, doesn't answer but appears uninjured. Sam picks up God's book and tries to open it again. It still won't open for him. Dean stands up from where he was thrown and rejoins the group. Castiel sighs.


INT. MEN OF LETTERS BUNKER – NIGHT

After an outside establishing shot of the bunker at night, we cut to DEAN who is sitting at a table in the bunker's lounge, drinking from a glass of whiskey ("Field's Kentucky bourbon"). The mostly-full bottle is on the table next to him. SAM approaches in the doorway, wiping his face with exhaustion. He notices Dean and joins him.


SAM
Hey.


DEAN
Hey.


Sam takes another glass from a side table and sits across from Dean.


SAM
I couldn't sleep, either.


Dean slides the bottle to Sam, who catches it, opens the bottle, and pours himself a drink.


DEAN
Sam, I'm sorry. About everything that–


SAM
Dean, you don't have to...


DEAN
I pulled a gun on you. It's like I just couldn't stop. You know, we were so close to beating him. It's like I could smell Chuck's blood in the water and I... Nothing else mattered. It was everything. And I just couldn't snap out of it.


SAM
Well, you did. You've snapped me out of worse.


DEAN
Mm.


SAM
You have.


DEAN
Well, whatever Chuck did to Amara, he's probably more powerful than ever. Billie wants us dead. Jack's powerless. And Michael's not returning our prayers. So we have no heavy hitters on our side. We're basically at zero.


SAM
We'll regroup, somehow.


DEAN
Right. Yeah. (He lifts his glass.) To somehow.


Sam huffs and lifts his glass but doesn't drink. Dean drinks from his glass, looking distracted. Sam watches him, concerned, before drinking also.


INT. DEATH'S LIBRARY – SECTION W


Billie walks the library, a hand over her heart from the pain of the wound in her shoulder. She walks past a REAPER who addresses her.


REAPER
Billie. I put up the warding that you asked for. It should stop The Empty from getting back in here.


BILLIE
(sullen, without looking) Fine.


REAPER
I take it the plan has changed?


BILLIE
(to the reaper, determined now) The plan has changed.


INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT – DAY


STEVIE is cooking scrambled eggs over a kitchen stove burner.


STEVIE
The trick? Low flame. Don't rush 'em. Not too runny, not too dry.


Stevie plates the eggs and turns to look at CHARLIE who is seated at the table behind her, cleaning a handgun. Charlie continues cleaning, doesn't look up until she's addressed.


STEVIE
Excuse me? What did I say about guns at the table?


CHARLIE
The weapon's table is all the way in the other room, and I love watching you cook.


Stevie smiles. Charlie is very charming, but Stevie isn't budging about this. Charlie sighs, sets aside the cleaning supplies and gestures to the empty table space in front of her with a smile. Appeased, Stevie smiles and sets the eggs down in front of her before returning to the stove and serving herself a plate. Charlie picks up a fork.


CHARLIE
Hey, I thought we could hit up that hideout after the sun goes down. Three to four shifters, perfect size for just us.


STEVIE
So, like a date?


CHARLIE
Yeah. Like a date.


They both smile. Charlie takes a bite of egg and is shocked.


CHARLIE
Oh my god.


STEVIE
Told ya.


Charlie
Wh– How are they like this?! Wow. Why have I been eating rubbery trash eggs all my life?! Babe, I swear, you are making these for me every morning for the rest of my...


The plate of eggs Stevie was holding shatters on the ground. Charlie looks up, concerned. Stevie is gone. Charlie stands up and looks around, fear mounting.


CHARLIE
Stevie? ...Stevie?


ACT II
INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT – DAY


After an establishing shot of Charlie's apartment (Kim Manor), we return to their kitchen. SAM is EMPing the area while CHARLIE talks to DEAN, seated in the living room.


CHARLIE
We met a few months ago. Bobby sent me to back her up on a djinn case. Thought Stevie might need my help. She didn't.


Dean and Sam make eye contact. Sam shakes his head. The EMP is negative. Dean returns his focus to Charlie. Sam sits on the couch beside him.


CHARLIE
I said I liked the way she handled herself. She accused me of flirting. I denied it. But then... (sighs, refocuses on Sam and Dean) I didn't know who else to call. I can't believe this happened. Why her and not me?


DEAN
That's what we're trying to figure out.


SAM
Charlie, why don't you just tell us everything you saw.


CHARLIE
I saw nothing. I heard nothing. I felt nothing. No chills, no sulfur smell. One second, Stevie was making breakfast, and the next she just... (crying) She just vanished.


Dean looks poignantly at Sam. He thinks he knows what this is. Sam looks from Dean to Charlie.


CHARLIE
What?


EXT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT – DAY


CASTIEL stands outside of the Impala, looking up at the apartment. Jack leans against the hood, facing away from him.


CASTIEL
They won't be long. They just didn't want to overwhelm their friend.


JACK
I don't mind.


CASTIEL
How're you feeling? You've been quiet.


JACK
How long you been waiting to ask me that?


CASTIEL
(quiet laugh) I guess I didn't want to overwhelm you.


Castiel rounds the Impala to sit on the hood next to Jack.


JACK
I feel... strange. I don't know if that's because of what happened to me, if it means something, or if I just feel strange because... It's over. The plan. My destiny. (tearfully) I was ready to die, and I wanted to. For Sam, for Dean, for the world. I wanted to make things right. And now... I don't know why I'm even here.


CASTIEL
Jack, you never needed absolution from Sam or Dean, or from me. We don't care about you because you're useful or because you fit into some grand design. We care about you because you're you.


JACK
(crying) God, The Empty, Billie... Everyone's so mad at us, and I don't have my powers. There's nothing I can do to protect us.


Castiel looks away, nodding. He knows Jack is right.


JACK
I'm scared, Cas.


CASTIEL
I know. Me, too.


Castiel puts a consoling hand on Jack's shoulder, then sighs. Cut back to the interior of the apartment.


DEAN
Charlie, we've made some big enemies lately. Uh...


SAM
Death. The Death. She wants to send you back. Everyone from other worlds sent back to worlds that don't exist anymore.


CHARLIE
So she's killing us.


DEAN
Well, we don't know for sure, but Stevie fits a pattern.


CHARLIE
A pattern? (she stands now, growing angry) I said I wasn't gonna do this again. The love thing. And I do. And the second I let my guard down, Stevie is just... She's gone. So, what, is she just some collateral damage to you? Is that what I'll be, too?


Dean looks down, doesn't answer. Sam's phone rings. Charlie crosses her arms, frustrated.


SAM
Sorry. It's Bobby, uh... Sorry.


Sam answers the phone and stands, walking away from Dean and Charlie as he speaks to Bobby.


SAM
(on the phone) Hey, what's up?


DEAN
(to Charlie) Charlie, I'm sorry.


Charlie doesn't answer, too sad, too frustrated, too angry.


SAM
(on the phone) Yeah, I understand. Okay, thanks. (hangs up the phone)


DEAN
(to Sam) What now?


SAM
Bobby was on a hunt with another Apocalypse World refugee, Greg, and Greg just vanished.


CHARLIE
It's spreading.


SAM
Yeah, I think so.


DEAN
So no one's safe. Anybody that's ever crossed over from another world, anyone that's ever been resurrected: all on Billy's list.


SAM
(realizing) Eileen.


Dean and Sam exchange looks. Sam looks to Charlie, a friend who is still hurting and still needs their help.


CHARLIE
(to Sam) Go.


Sam nods to Charlie, grateful, then nods to Dean with urgent determination. Dean stands to exit.


EXT. ON THE ROAD – NIGHT


The Impala speeds down a rainy road at night time, driven by DEAN who is focused on the road. Castiel and Jack sit in tense silence in the back seat. Sam, riding shotgun, texts EILEEN on his phone.


EILEEN: Hey Sam <3 What's up?
SAM: I need you to trust me. I'll be there soon, but I need you to get out of your house, get somewhere public.
EILEEN: What? You're scaring me.
SAM: Wait out by your car. We're on the way.
EILEEN: Please, Sam— tell me what's going on?
SAM: Just wait. We're almost there.


Sam's phone shows "..." that Eileen is texting. A tense few seconds, and then the notification stops. He doesn't receive an answer from her.


SAM: Eileen?
SAM: Eileen???


No response. Sam looks with concern over to Dean. Dean glances between Sam and the phone. He knows what that look means. He floors it. Cut to a suburban street outside of EILEEN'S HOUSE. The Impala skids into a parking spot behind Eileen's car. Sam is out the door before the Impala is even parked. Jack, Dean, and Castiel follow him out of the car a moment later. Sam finds Eileen's phone on the sidewalk, next to her car keys and her purse. He checks the phone (a picture of Sam in the bunker is her lock screen) and sees two missed messages from himself. The screen is cracked. He opens the lock screen and her message, "Okay, at my car, now tell me wh" is unsent. Sam looks up, distressed. Dean looks around. There's no one else in sight. Eileen vanished, too. He looks back at Sam, who sighs and slowly stands. He's heartbroken, close to tears, but he holds it back.


DEAN
Sammy?


SAM
No. I can't... Um... If I let myself go, then I'll lose my mind. I can't right now.


Behind him, the others look on, sympathetic but silent, waiting for Sam to decide their next move.


SAM
Alright. We have to get everyone to safety. Anyone who might be on Billie's list.


CASTIEL
Where might that be?


SAM
We need a location, somewhere central to everyone. We need somewhere secure, contained. We get 'em in, and we put up every last bit of warding we've ever used.


DEAN
Alright, you do that.


SAM
What? What are you going to do?


DEAN
I started this. I'm gonna end it.


SAM
Dean...


DEAN
Your plan? Getting everybody safe? That's good, okay, but it won't last forever. Now, we couldn't make Chuck pay, but Billie? She left her blade. Her I can kill.


SAM
I don't...


DEAN
We don't have a choice, Sam.


CASTIEL
I'll go with you, Dean.


DEAN
Alright.


SAM
Be careful.


Dean smiles sadly, hugs Sam who is now in tears. He holds Sam's neck, pats his shoulder, they nod, summoning their strength despite Sam's loss and how bleak the outlook of killing Death is.


DEAN
Okay. (turning to walk to the Impala) Let's go, Cas. Let's go reap a reaper.


Castiel follows Dean to the Impala while Sam and Jack are left behind, watching them go.


ACT III
EXT. RURAL MINNESOTA – DAY


DONNA leans against the side of her truck, phone to her ear as she talks to SAM.


SAM
(through the phone) Hey. What'd you find?


DONNA
It's the old Harmon property. It's got an abandoned silo, so it should fit the bill. It's just south of me in Hastings. I'll send you the coordinates, 'kay?


Cut to SAM who is standing outside of Eileen's car at a gas-n-sip fuel pump. JACK is in the front passenger seat, waiting quietly.


SAM
Great, thanks.


DONNA
(through the phone) I put out an APB to everyone I know.


Cut back to Donna, who is still standing next to her truck.


DONNA
I've been in touch with Bobby. He's doing likewise, so...


Cut back to Sam, who is looking at Jack through the back window as he puts gas in the car. Jack is still staring silently, sullenly, forward.


DONNA
(through the phone) What's the plan when you get here?


SAM
I'm still working on that.


Cut to Donna, who is solemn.


DONNA
Okey doke.


Cut back to Sam. He hangs up the phone, sets the gas nozzle back in its pump and circles the car to the passenger side. He leans over Jack's open window.


SAM
Hey, I got a job for you.


JACK
Me?


SAM
Yeah. I need you to drive.


JACK
But I only drove once.


SAM
I've got work to do. You know, I gotta dig through the archives and work on finding spells. I can't do that with one eye on the road, so.


Sam gestures for Jack to move over. Jack slides into the driver's seat.


JACK
Okay. Okay. I'll... Drive.


Jack starts the engine, and they pull away from the gas-n-sip.


INT. MEN OF LETTERS BUNKER


Dean enters in a rush, followed closely by Castiel. They hurry down the stairs.


DEAN
Alright, man, we gotta move fast. You got the key to Billie's library?


CASTIEL
Yeah, but we don't even know for sure that she'll be there.


DEAN
Then we'll wreck her place. We'll burn her books... (grabbing the scythe) Whatever it takes to smoke her out.


They head deeper into the bunker. Cut to an exterior shot of the silo in Hastings, Minnesota. JACK and SAM arrive in Eileen's car. DONNA closes the trunk to her truck, a cargo bag over her shoulder. She smiles sadly to see them. Behind them, other refugee hunters are going into the silo.


DONNA
(to Jack) Hiya, kid.


JACK
Hey. (to Sam) I'll help set up the warding.


Jack exits to the silo, leaving Donna and Sam to talk. Donna embraces Sam.


DONNA
I'm sorry... About Eileen.


Sam nods, unable to talk about it yet. Donna understands, clears her throat, moves the topic along.


DONNA
So. Bobby's inside with his crew. We've got more folks headed this way. Put out some calls to the other hunters: Garth, Jody and the girls. They're all on high alert, ready to act when we need 'em.


SAM
They're not on Death's list. They should be okay. You should be okay, too. We're just... lucky to have you helping.


DONNA
Anything you need.


Donna smiles sadly. Sam nods. Donna nods back and exits to the silo. A blue truck arrives, parks. Sam's eyebrows lift. Out walks CHARLIE, a backpack over her shoulder.


SAM
Hey. Glad you came.


CHARLIE
Yeah, um... I just don't want this to happen to anyone else.


Sam nods sadly. He can relate. Charlie exits to the silo while Sam waits behind. He sighs.


Cut to inside the silo where the refugees are gathered, more still arriving. Jack, Donna, and Charlie are among them. There are also familiar faces from the Apocalypse World who had lived in the bunker, and two young girls. There is warding painted in black all over the walls. BOBBY is among them. He sets a book down on a stack. Sam enters from above, a can of spray paint in his hands. He doesn't make eye contact with Bobby, but Bobby reads him like a book, anyway.


BOBBY
They get it, Sam. Now whether you like it or not, you're the big man, here. Told them getting here was the order from the boss, and they came runnin'. No hesitation. My only worry is the lav situation. Didn't have time to truck in a port-a-john. (chuckle)


SAM
(huffs) Yeah, well, if Dean and Cas can pull this off, we shouldn't be here too long.


BOBBY
Okay. I brought a bucket.


The joke finally pays off, and Sam laughs. Bobby looks around, finally asks what he's really worried about.


BOBBY
You think it'll work?


SAM
(looking around also) Well... Angelic warding, Aramaic, Enochian, and I have this. (holds up a book) I found it in Rowena's things. A spell, "Praeses Magna." Should boost the strength of all the warding.


BOBBY
Should?


SAM
Bobby, this is all I got.


Bobby nods solemnly. He and Sam look around at all the people in the silo, the children, the other refugee hunters, Charlie... They know how much they stand to lose. Donna and Jack paint more warding on the walls. Jack notices a weed growing in the dirt just inside the silo's wall. He kneels down to get a better look. Donna notices this.


DONNA
You know, I'm no expert on this hoodoo stuff, but... Best we patch that up, yeah?


JACK
Yeah. ...I guess.


Donna exits to work elsewhere in the silo. Jack reaches out to pluck the weed. It blackens and withers under his hand before he can even touch it. Surprised, he pulls his hand away. His powers are gone, so what was that? He looks at his hand in concern.


INT. DEATH'S LIBRARY – SECTION W


Dean, scythe in hand, and Castiel quietly enter from the door to Death's library. They look around. No sight of Billie. The door closes behind them. Dean gestures down the hall. Castiel heads that way while Dean moves forward down the row. A short way down, Dean finds Billie, her back to him as she stands at the front of the reception desk. Scythe in hand, he walks quietly towards her. Without turning, she address him.


BILLIE
So... I guess this is the part where I say, "Hello, Boys."


She turns. It's just Dean there, alone? She looks around, and Castiel enters from another row, an angel blade in his hand. Just as Billie expected. She address Dean again.


BILLIE
Hello, boys. ...What's the plan? Take me down with my own weapon?


CASTIEL
Something like that.


BILLIE
(to Castiel, nodding towards Dean) Well, he better work on his aim.


DEAN
Thing is, that time? I wasn't trying to kill you.


BILLIE
Mm. What's changed?


DEAN
Oh, I don't know. Could be that you started killing all my friends.


Billie knows he's wrong. She smiles. Dean readies the scythe.


BILLIE
Interesting.


Billie gestures quickly towards Dean, and he goes flying back across the room, dropping the scythe as he hits the far wall. Castiel rushes at Billie, but he's stopped short as she stretches out her hand, and he's caught by an invisible grip on his neck. She moves towards him and he brings both hands to his neck, gasping in pain as her grip tightens. Dean climbs back to standing, grabbing the scythe up again. Billie chokes Castiel with her hand now, baring her teeth as he shoves him against a wall, then up it, off his feet. Castiel grips her arm but he can't get free.


BILLIE
Castiel. Remember when you stabbed me in the back? 'Cause I do.


Dean arrives, jabbing the blunt end of the scythe into the wound in Billie's shoulder. She yells in pain and drops Castiel. Dean strikes at her with the blade this time aiming for her neck, but Billie catches it with her right hand. She shudders in pain. Her palm glows where the blade cuts into it. Dean holds the pressure, threatening to slice into her.


DEAN
It's over. Call it off. Stop killing my people!


BILLIE
(panting with effort and pain) I didn't hurt your friends.


DEAN
What?


BILLIE
(laughs) You're in the wrong place, Dean.


DEAN
What're you talking about?


Cut to the silo where SAM is reading the Latin spell from the book.


SAM
Has virtutes conliga, eas integra, eas firma, nos omnes serva.


The refugees, BOBBY, CHARLIE, DONNA, and JACK look on, tense. Sam finishes reading the spell and the warding glows red before fading. Some smile, relieved. Seems like it worked.


CHARLIE
So now what do we do?


SAM
We wait.


Cut to Death's library, where Dean still holds the scythe against Billie's hand, and throat.


BILLE
If people are getting gone, I'm guessing it's Chuck. And that means you're just wasting time.


Dean looks unsure. Is this a trick, or is she telling the truth? Cut back to the silo, where one of the little girls, Lily, vanishes in a puff of dust. The girl next to her, her sister Dana, screams. Sam and Bobby turn to look, startled.


BOBBY
Sam?


REFUGEE DAD
Dana, where's your sister?


DANA
I don't know!


SAM
It's not working.


REFUGEE MOM
(sobbing) Ah, Lily!


REFUGEE DAD
Lily! Lily!


DANA
Dad!


As Dana runs to hug her parents, all three of them disappear in a puff of dust. The other refugee hunters begin to panic and scream as they, too, vanish into dust. Some run. Some hug.


SPENCER
Yo, grab the gun, let's get out of here.


REFUGEE HUNTER #1
We gotta go!


They both vanish. Charlie tries to help others escape, ushering some of the refugees who are left.


CHARLIE
Go! Go!


REFUGEE HUNTER #2
Door, door!


They, too, vanish in front of her. Charlie turns to Sam, panicked.


CHARLIE
Sam, what do we do?!


Charlie vanishes before Sam can answer. Sam is stunned. Bobby turns towards him, speechless. Sam looks at Bobby. Bobby vanishes into dust. Sam looks at Donna and Jack. The three of them look around. The silo is empty. It's only the three of them left. They've failed. But it's not over yet.


DONNA
Sam?!


Before Sam and Jack's eyes, Donna vanishes, too. Cut back to Death's library, where Dean still has Billie pinned by the scythe.


BILLIE
I'll let you in on something. When you cut me, that little nick? It was fatal. Something I can't survive. See for yourself.


Billie peels back her trench coat. The wound on her shoulder looks necrotic and sticky, the ugly green wound stretching across her shoulder and onto her chest beneath her shirt. She's telling the truth. Dean realizes he's wasted his time, like she said.


BILLIE
You killed me, Dean. So yeah, no. I don't care about your friends. I don't care about your family. But seeing you here has reminded me of something. There is one thing I'd like, one wish before I go... I'd like to see you dead!


Dean's look hardens again. Billie grabs the staff of the scythe in her left hand and pulls it aside, backhanding Dean with her right fist. Dean drops the scythe as he falls back. Castiel steps forward to catch him from falling as Billie slices at the air where they had just been. She stands and gestures again, and both Castiel and Dean go flying back. They get to their feet quickly as Billie watches, menacing.


BILLIE
I'm so glad you came.


Billie stalks slowly forward as Dean, followed by Cas, make a break for it down the aisle. Billie, smiling, follows leisurely forward. Dean finds the door they'd come through, and he and Castiel rush through it, back for the bunker. Cut back to the silo where JACK and SAM look around at the emptiness in shock. They look at each other in fear and sadness. They've failed. Worse than that, they lost someone who wasn't from another world. What now?


ACT IV
INT. MEN OF LETTERS BUNKER – BASEMENT'


DEAN and CASTIEL re-enter the bunker through the library door and slam it shut behind them, returning it to sold brick.


DEAN
Come on.


They keep running, upstairs to the main floor of the bunker, and the map room. Dean wanders the room.


DEAN
Come on, Dean. Think. Think!


CASTIEL
Dean, where are you going?!


DEAN
I... I don't know!


CASTIEL
You know she can find us anywhere.


DEAN
I know, I know that! I just... What do we do, Ca–


Dean is interrupted by a sudden shock of pain as BILLIE arrives on the balcony behind him. He drops to the floor, clutching his chest, crying out in pain. Castiel, shocked, sees the culprit above them.


CASTIEL
Billie.


He grabs Dean by the shoulders to guide him away. On the balcony, Billie has her necrotic, injured hand outstretched, squeezing.


DEAN
My heart... I can feel her.


CASTIEL
Come on, Dean. We gotta go. Come on.


Castiel pulls Dean away, almost carrying him through the bunker as Dean gasps and grunts in pain. At the bottom of the stairs now, Billie follows them slowly, her hand still upturned and squeezing.


BILLIE
It's you, Dean. It's always been you. Death-defying. Rule-breaking. You are everything I lived to set right. To put down. To tame.


Dean collapses beside the bookshelves just out of view, gripping his chest. Castiel looks over his shoulder where Billie still approaches.


BILLIE
You are human disorder incarnate.


Billie arrives at the bookshelves, but Dean and Castiel are nowhere in sight. She continues to follow slowly behind where they must've gone, back downstairs. In the downstairs hallway, Castiel's supporting Dean's weight with Dean's arm over his shoulders as he hurries him through the bunker, away from Billie. Dean clutches his heart, groaning in pain.


CASTIEL
I've got you.


They round another hallway corner, but not far behind them is Billie, still holding her scythe.


BILLIE
Come on, Dean. You can't escape me.


Billie drags the blade of her scythe against the tile wall. Castiel and Dean hurry on as they hear the metal grinding.


BILLIE
Don't you think it's finally time? Time for the sweet release of death?


Around another corner, Castiel guides Dean into basement storage room 7B and closes the door behind them. Dean coughs, still holding his chest as he doubles over. Castiel finds a pocket knife in Dean's back pants pocket and uses it to cut his own palm. He uses the blood to paint warding onto the door. Billie approaches the door. The warding glows as it completes. Dean inhales, leaning back in relief as the pain subsides. Castiel turns towards him.


CASTIEL
Did it work?


Dean swallows hard and nods. Billie places her injured hand just in front of the door, sensing the warding.


CASTIEL
It blocked her grip on you.


Billie pounds her fist against the door. It shudders. The warding crackles, but holds. The slow pounding continues periodically throughout Castiel and Dean's conversation.


CASTIEL
Dean, she said that wound was killing her. Maybe we can wait her out.


DEAN
Yeah, and if we can't?


CASTIEL
Then we fight.


DEAN
We'll lose. (walking slowly towards the back wall of the room, hopeless) I just led us into another trap, all because I couldn't hurt Chuck. Because I was angry and because I just needed something to kill, and because that's all I know how to do.


CASTIEL
Dean... (approaches him)


DEAN
It was Chuck all along. We shouldn't have left Sam and Jack. We should be there with them right now. (tearfully) Everybody's gonna die, Cas. Everybody. I can't stop it. (approaches Cas) She's gonna get through that door.


CASTIEL
(quietly) I know.


DEAN
And she's gonna kill you, and then she's gonna kill me.


Castiel and Dean exchange a look. Castiel agrees, this situation is hopeless, but he can't bring himself to say it.


DEAN
I'm sorry.


CASTIEL
(realizing) Wait, there is... There's one thing she's afraid of. There's one thing strong enough to stop her. When Jack was dying, I made a deal to save him.


DEAN
You what?


CASTIEL
The price was my life. When I experienced a moment of true happiness, The Empty would be summoned, and it would take me forever.


DEAN
Why are you telling me this now?


CASTIEL
(tearfully) I always wondered, ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be? What my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer because the one thing I want... It's something I know I can't have. But I think I know... I think I know now. Happiness isn't in the having, it's in just being. It's in just saying it.


DEAN
What are you talking about, man?


CASTIEL
I know. I know how you see yourself, Dean. You see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You're destructive, and you're angry, and you're broken. You're "daddy's blunt instrument." And you think that hate and anger, that's... That's what drives you, that's who you are. It's not. And everyone who knows you see it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are. You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know. (he smiles, crying now) You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell... Knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack... I cared about the whole world because of you. (sad laugh as a tear rolls down his cheek) You changed me, Dean.


DEAN
(quiet, resigned) Why does this sound like a goodbye?


CASTIEL
Because it is.


Dean inhales, ready to argue, but Castiel confesses before he can.


CASTIEL
I love you. (he smiles)


DEAN
Don't do this, Cas.


There's a wet noise from behind Dean and he turns to see black goo from The Empty squeezing through the bricks in the bunker's wall as a portal begins to open. They both know what this means. There are tears in Dean's eyes as he turns back to Castiel. Castiel is still smiling tearfully. The warded door busts open. Billie stands behind it with her scythe. There's no more time.


DEAN
Cas...


Castiel puts his hand, bloodied from when he'd cut it for the warding, on Dean's shoulder.


CASTIEL
Goodbye, Dean.


DEAN
What?


Castiel shoves Dean aside. He hits the floor beneath the portal. A handprint of Castiel's blood remains on the shoulder of his jacket. Billie enters the room. Castiel looks at Dean one last time, smiling, and inhales as the black liquid tendrils of The Empty wrap around him. The Empty crashes against Billie, pulling her in along with them. Dean watches in shock as the portal to The Empty closes, and he's left alone, panting, stunned.


ACT V
EXT. HASTINGS, MINNESOTA – DAY


JACK and SAM exit the silo. Sam is on his phone. He hangs up in frustration and dials again. The phone goes to voicemail.


DEAN: This is Dean's other-other cell, so. You must know what to do.


Sam hangs up again, concerned, thoughtful, fearing the worst. Jack feels the same.


JACK
Sam? Was it just them?


SAM
...I don't know.


Cut to the gas-n-sip, a suburban street, a child's playground, swings still swaying: all empty. Has the whole world vanished? Cut back to Jack and Sam who look at each other, near tears at the possibility. Cut to DEAN, who is still alone in the basement of the bunker, still sitting against the wall where CASTIEL had pushed him. He holds his cellphone in his hand. As it vibrates, ringing again, he looks at it. "Incoming Call: Sam" He stares at it, then looks around, tears in his eyes. He drops the phone, leaving it to ring on the stone ground as he buries his face in his hands and begins to cry.
