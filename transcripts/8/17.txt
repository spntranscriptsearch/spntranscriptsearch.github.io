NOW
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
DEAN comes around the corner in a darkened warehouse, gun drawn. He brings his gun up but it's struck down. He is struck down. CASTIEL appears over him.

DEAN
No, Cas. No! [DEAN raises his hand towards CASTIEL, but CASTIEL breaks his wrist, we hear the bone snap. DEAN groans in pain.]

DEAN
No, Cas, don't. [CASTIEL looms over DEAN, raises his angel blade.] Please. [CASTIEL buries the weapon into DEAN's chest. DEAN chokes. CASTIEL wrenches the blade from DEAN's chest, DEAN falls back, dead. Focus is on DEAN's face, blood running out of his mouth. We hear the click of switches, the buzz of electricity, the lights come on. NAOMI walks into the room.]

NAOMI
No hesitation. Quick. Brutal. [NAOMI and CASTIEL stare down at DEAN.] Everything's back in order. [NAOMI smiles at CASTIEL.] Finally. [We see a close-up of CASTIEL, his face expressionless.] You're ready.

POV pulls back from DEAN to where we can see the entire floor of the warehouse covered with bodies in various positions, all bloodied, all dead, all DEAN.

SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)

ACT ONE
INT. BUNKER - NIGHT
Close-up of large wooden boxes, we see a pair of hands reaching into a box and pull out a smaller rectangular box with a glass lid. It is the tip of a spear.

DEAN
What the hell is this? [Sighs; reads the contents of the box.] Spear of Destiny? What is this -- God's toothpick? [We see SAM in the control room typing away on his laptop.] You know, would it have killed these asshats to label these boxes in something other than hieroglyphics? It's ridiculous. [DEAN picks up a small box, opens it and lifts out an object, turns it over in his hands. We look over SAM's shoulder to see DEAN in the Men of Letter's library, table covered with large wooden and cardboard boxes.] Hey. You listening to me?

SAM
Yeah. It's, uh... [SAM clears his throat.] Fascinating stuff. [We see DEAN opening another smaller box, looks like a Faberge egg.] You should probably, uh, write it all down in your journal for the archives, you know? [Clears his throat again.]

DEAN
Yeah, thanks. You're a lot of help. [DEAN takes the ornate red and gold egg out of the box, opens it, sniffs it. SAM coughs in the background.] Hey, Doc Holliday, you all right over there?

SAM
Uh, yeah. [SAM coughs into a napkin, pulls it away, it's bloody.] Um... [Clears his throat.] I'm fine. [SAM throws the bloody napkin into the trashcan.] Just, uh, wrong pipe. [SAM takes a drink from his glass, gives another cough.]

DEAN is still sorting, pulls out a folder that contains an old magazine titled "Voluptuous ASIAN LOVELIES." He chuckles at the picture of the Asian woman on the cover holding a paper parasol.

DEAN
Well, hello. [He flips through the old porn magazine.] These Men of Letters weren't so boring after all. Konnichiwa. [Said in Japanese to a page entitled "Appreciation of Asian Lovelies."] Hey, check this out. [DEAN walks down into the control room holding the magazine for SAM to see.]

SAM
Dude, what is wrong with you?

DEAN
What's wrong with me? You kidding me? This is a first edition, dude. [We get an overhead shot of SAM sitting at the laminated map table.] You know what this would go for on eBay?

SAM
No. Why? Do you?

DEAN
No. Maybe. Shut up. You find anything? [Overhead shot as DEAN sits sideways at the map table, the waste basket to SAM's side, but in front of DEAN.]
SAM
I did, yeah -- uh, dead bodies showing up all over the Midwest last week. Benton, Indiana; Downers Grove, Illinois; uh, Novi, Michigan; and then again last night in Lincoln Springs, Missouri.

DEAN
And how is this us?

SAM
Because each of the victims had severe burns around their eyes, hands, and feet, puncture wounds through the backs of their hands, eyes and internal organs liquefied.

DEAN
[Smacks lips.] That sounds like us.

SAM
Yeah. Also, no link between any of the victims. Uh, one was a real-estate agent. Another was a local historian. Woman killed last night was a teacher.

DEAN
So, chupacabra. [SAM chuckles.] What do we got? Power tools gone rogue? Wait -- are we talking a-a "Maximum Overdrive" situation here?

SAM
I don't know. Worth a shot, though. I'll grab my gear. We should probably leave in five.

DEAN
Mm-hmm. [DEAN's focus is still on the magazine.]

SAM
'Less, of course, you need some more time with Miss October.

DEAN
What? Oh. Yeah. Yeah, make it 10. [SAM chuckles, gets up and leaves. DEAN puts down the magazine and sees the waste basket, he holds it up, there's the bloody napkin.]

EXT. IMPALA PARKED OUTSIDE THE MORTON HOUSE - DAY

SAM (V O)
We just have a few routine follow-up questions about your wife, sir.

INT. MORTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

SAM
Did she have any enemies? [SAM and DEAN are wearing their Fed suits.]

MR. MORTON
Ann? Honestly, I can't think of a soul who'd want to hurt her, even after everything that happened.

DEAN
Everything that happened?

MR. MORTON
About a week ago, something changed in Ann. She was out of sorts, not herself at all.

SAM
Out of sorts how?

MR. MORTON
It'd be better if I show you.

INT. MORTON HOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY

MR. MORTON
She stopped sleeping. [They walk down stairs into the basement with limited lighting, MR. MORTON turns on a switch that lights only half of the basement.] She stopped eating. She went out in the middle of the night, going God knows where. [MR. MORTON stands on the darker side of the basement.] I tried to talk to her, but, uh... She would just mutter to herself. [SAM and DEAN walk to the lit side of the basement. There's a large table covered with a miniature village, little plastic bags dangle over the table.]

SAM
About what?

MR. MORTON
Something... about an orchard? [We get a better view of the contents on the table. It's the model replica of a village made out of metal containers, cardboard boxes, a birdhouse, everything an ash grey in color.] Finally, I just followed her one night, and she went to the playground. Over here -- the elementary school. [MR. MORTON points to a section that looks like the replica of a school and playground. It's surrounded by a wall, has open areas, trees, miniature people. There are even several Matchbox cars on the "road" that surrounds the school, properly positioned to show traffic flow.] And she started digging. She would leave with these little bags full of dirt. Hung them here. [We see a close-up of the dirt filled plastic baggies hanging over the table.] All these bags represent holes that she dug in the ground.

DEAN
Were these holes, uh -- I don't know -- 6 feet deep?

MR. MORTON
No. She dug for hours. She never broke a sweat. Straight down 10, maybe 15 feet.

SAM
Did you notice anything else?

MR. MORTON
I didn't say anything to the cops 'cause I didn't want them to think I was crazy. After Ann came home, I came down here to confront her, and she was on the phone.

DEAN
Any idea who she was talking to?

MR. MORTON
No. But I know what I saw. And it wasn't my Annie. After I called her out, her eyes... they turned black. Now, I-I know I must have imagined it. I know I did. But I-I left. I went to the bar, probably had too much to drink, and by the time I came back... [Sighs.] ...my Annie was, uh... I should have stayed. I should have protected her. I'm moving into my sister's place today. I can't be here anymore.

SAM
Sure. Well, um, thank you very much for your time. We're both very sorry for your loss.

EXT. MORTON HOUSE - DAY

DEAN
So, somebody's killing demons. [DEAN and SAM walk down the stairs to the sidewalk.] Well, that is awesome. I feel like we should send a card or flowers. What kind of flower says "thanks for killing demons"?

SAM
Yeah, but who's killing demons? And why? And, by the way, since when does a demon possess someone, then go all "Beautiful Mind" and -- and start digging in the dirt? Does any of this seem right to you?

DEAN
I like the part about killing demons. That sounds right. [SAM sighs.]

EXT. RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

SAM
Sure. Of course. [SAM is talking on his cellphone as the IMPALA comes to a stop in a residential area, the engine is shut off.] Well, thank you very much for all your help. I really appreciate the time. [SAM and DEAN get out of the car, the doors close.] All right. Bye. [SAM closes his cellphone.] So, real-estate guy's wife said he was acting weird. Uh, historian's hubby said the same -- just got all obsessive and then weird. No one saw any black eyes, but still, where there's smoke, you know... [They walk up to a nice house.] I wonder what they're all looking for.

DEAN
Well, Wendy Rice here was the last person to speak with Ann, so let's see if she can tell us. [SAM knocks on the door of WENDY RICE's house. A woman with her hair covered with large blue and purple curlers opens the door.]

SAM
Special Agent Lynne. This is my partner, Special Agent Tandy. We'd like to ask you a few questions about Ann Morton.

WENDY RICE
Oh. [She chuckles self-consciously, plays with a curler.] Uh, uh, uh, of course. Please come in. I had never met her before she called the other night.

SAM
Now, why was she calling you?

WENDY RICE
She was looking to find an original map of the city.

SAM
Did she say what for?

WENDY RICE
Well, she -- she didn't, but she did mention an -- an old orchard that had gone missing.

DEAN
Missing?

WENDY RICE
This -- this town was wiped from the earth by one of the river's 100-year floods. It was -- it was rebuilt. But all the original records were -- were lost. [She smiles, plays with her curler again.] I'm -- I'm a PhD candidate. And this -- this is my research. I, uh... My dissertation is -- is on the history of this town and, uh, its connection to the Underground Railroad and -- and -- and whatnot. [She eagerly hops up, brings over a bright pink binder, pulls out a map.] I've been working to re-create a map for years as part of my research, and this -- this is the old Jakubiak orchard there. [she points to a section of the map.] I found out yesterday it's where Downey meets Bond Street.

SAM
Now, did Ann say why she was looking for the site of an old orchard?

WENDY RICE
No. We -- we set a time to meet, and she never showed. Then I read about her in the paper. It's just tragic. Ann's assistant called this morning, though, asking if I still had the map.

SAM
Assistant? [We hear several knocks on the front door.]

WENDY RICE
Oh. That's probably him. Maybe he can help. [She gets up to answer the door, SAM and DEAN follow, we hear a dog barking in the distance.]

WENDY RICE
Oh. Are -- are you -- [She has opened the door to find three men standing there. Their eyes go demon black when DEAN and SAM show up behind WENDY RICE. She screams. The three demons barge in and a fight erupts. WENDY RICE is flung into the living room, she smashes into the coffee table. The demon who had tossed WENDY RICE grabs the map, then runs out the door. DEAN pulls out the demon-killing knife, just before he stabs one of the demons, black smoke erupts from the demon's mouth and flies into WENDY RICE's mouth, possessing her, her eyes turn black. She gets up and runs towards another door, DEAN runs after her. Meanwhile SAM is being bested by the third demon, when suddenly the demon is burned out by CASTIEL who tosses the body aside. CASTIEL stands there holding WENDY RICE by her curlers.]

ACT TWO
INT. WENDY RICE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

DEAN
Put this on your shoulder. [DEAN tosses a cold pack at SAM who is seated on the couch, SAM throws it on the floor, clears his throat. DEAN sits down next to SAM. CASTIEL walks into the room.]

SAM
I'm fine.

CASTIEL
The other demon escaped. I bound the one I caught in a devil's trap. I'm gonna interrogate it now.

SAM
Wait a second. Cas. How about you answer some questions first? Like, where the hell have you been?

DEAN
You heard me, didn't you?

SAM
You prayed to him?

CASTIEL
Yes, I heard you. But that's not why I'm here. [CASTIEL sits down, sighs.] I've been hunting demons.

SAM
So this is you. Why?

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - DAY
CASTIEL
What should I tell them? [Flash to CASTIEL seated in front of NAOMI in her stainless steel, white office.]

NAOMI
The truth. Most of it, anyway. [She gets up and walks around to sit on her desk in front of CASTIEL.] Maybe they can get us closer.

INT. WENDY RICE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

CASTIEL
I've been searching for the other half of the Demon Tablet. [Switch to CASTIEL sitting with the WINCHESTERs in WENDY RICE's living room.]

DEAN
Without us?

CASTIEL
I've been trying to help, Dean. And in my search, I uncovered that Crowley has sent out demons to find Lucifer's crypts.

DEAN
Lucifer had crypts?

CASTIEL
Dozens of them, apparently.

SAM
But why the storage wars? I mean, what the hell are they all looking for?

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - DAY

CASTIEL
It would be more helpful if they knew everything. [CASTIEL is once again seated in NAOMI's brightly lit office.]

NAOMI
They cannot be trusted.

CASTIEL
But --

NAOMI
Lie, Castiel. Tell them what we discussed.

INT. WENDY RICE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

CASTIEL
They're looking for a parchment that would allow them to decipher Crowley's half of the Demon Tablet without a Prophet. [Switch back to WENDY RICE's living room, CASTIEL mimics NAOMI.]

DEAN
A demonic decoder ring? In Crowley's hands? Awesome.

CASTIEL
The crypts were, uh, lost over time. Only those closest to Lucifer knew their whereabouts.

SAM
Then how did Crowley find them?

CASTIEL
His demons have been possessing locals who may have some special knowledge.

SAM
That would explain the crazy room at Ann's house. [DEAN sniffs.] But how did they know where to start looking in the first place?

CASTIEL
I don't know. I'm hoping the strange-haired demon in the kitchen is more knowledgeable than the others I interrogated. [CASTIEL gets up from the easy chair, goes into the kitchen through the swinging door.]

DEAN
Well, he puts the "ass" in "Cas," huh?

SAM
He's definitely off.

DEAN
Off? He hasn't been right since he got back from Purgatory. We still don't know how he got out of there.

SAM
I don't know, Dean. If he's so sketchy, then why were you praying to him?

CASTIEL (V O)
You know, I can hear you both. I am a celestial being.

INT. WENDY RICE'S KITCHEN - DAY

WENDY RICE
Sam and Dean Winchester. [WENDY RICE is tied to the kitchen table, each hand is fastened separately to a side of the table, palms down. She chuckles. SAM and DEAN lean against the sink, facing her. CASTIEL stands to the side.] Oh, the thoughts she had about you two. Mostly you, Sam. What can I say? She has a thing for smutton chops.

DEAN
All right, you douchebag, listen -- [CASTIEL stabs his angel blade through the back of one of WENDY RICE's hands.]

WENDY RICE
Aah! [She screams, pants, and whimpers as CASTIEL pulls the blade out of her hand, sparks flying from the weapon.]

CASTIEL
Who told you about the crypts?

WENDY RICE
I thought angels were supposed to be the good cops. [CASTIEL impales her other hand.] Aah! [She screams, the wound sparking.] Wait! Stop! Stop!! We have a hostage! [CASTIEL wrenches the blade out of her hand, she's panting and gasping from the pain of the angel blade.] It's one of Crowley's pets. She's at the Murray Hotel, down by the interstate. She knows the towns where all the crypts are buried. She saw them all back in the day.

SAM
And she told you about the parchment?

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - DAY

Quick POV shift to NAOMI and CASTIEL looking at each other, worried.

INT. WENDY RICE'S KITCHEN - DAY

WENDY RICE
What parchment?!

DEAN
Hey. Hey! Think he's the only bad cop in this room? Stop lying! We know what you're really looking for.

WENDY RICE
No. I am telling you, we're looking...

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - DAY

NAOMI
Kill it!

INT. WENDY RICE'S KITCHEN - DAY

WENDY RICE
...for -- aah! [CASTIEL stabs the angel blade into WENDY RICE's chest, sparking, the demon dies.]

SAM
Cas! What the hell was that?!

CASTIEL
It told us what we needed.

SAM
No, she didn't! You can't just --

CASTIEL
I started this hunt without you because I didn't want anything to slow me down. We have to get to the motel now.

SAM
Hold on a second -- [We hear the rustling of angel wings, CASTIEL is gone.]

SAM and DEAN
Cas!

DEAN
Cas? Cas? Damn it. [They rush out.] Go. Go. Go.

EXT. OUTSIDE MURRAY HOTEL - DAY

The IMPALA races into view, tires squeal, then screech to a halt, the engine shuts off. DEAN and SAM jump out of the car and look up as we see a flash of light coming from a third floor window.]

SAM
There. There. [They race for the hotel, still looking up towards the window.]

INT. MURRAY HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

DEAN and SAM run through the hallway, stopping outside a closed door. There's another flash of light coming from around the door, we hear a cry of pain. They burst into the room as a demon with burned out eyes topples onto the body of another dead demon whose eyes have also been burned out. CASTIEL stands there.

SAM
Thanks for waiting.

CASTIEL
The hostage is in there. [He nods his head towards a closed door. DEAN opens the door. We see MEG, with long, blond hair, bruised, bloody face, tied up, sitting on the floor.]

MEG
Aren't you a little short for a Stormtrooper?

INT. MURRAY HOTEL ROOM - DAY

DEAN
So, I got to ask. Um... [MEG is now seated on a bed, we get a close-up of her battered, bloody face.] What's up with the hair? [POV pulls back, MEG is sitting cross legged on the bed, SAM and DEAN in chairs at the foot of the bed, CASTIEL stands facing them, his arms across his chest, his back to the window.] What?

MEG
Aww. Thanks for noticing, Dean. But this wasn't my idea. It was Crowley's. And it's just another reason I want to stab him in the face.

SAM
Wait a second. You've been telling Crowley the location of Lucifer's crypts.

MEG
What can I say? I needed a break from the constant torture. And I did visit them all during my time with Yellow Eyes. But don't worry. I haven't exactly been giving them the Glengarry leads.

CASTIEL
You mean you've been lying to them?

MEG
I just get them in the ballpark. Enough time's passed and enough's changed that they bought it.

DEAN
Why lie?

MEG
Buy myself some time, dummy. Try to find a way to get free.

SAM
Wait -- so... A bunch of innocent people died so you could... buy yourself some time?

MEG
Hi. I'm Meg. I'm a demon.

CASTIEL
So, what have they found?

MEG
Bupkis. Every crypt's been one Al Capone's vault after another. And on top of that, someone kept picking up the trail and icing demons. I'm guessing that was you, Castiel. But Crowley just keeps sending more. He's hell-bent on...

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - DAY

CASTIEL
She's gonna tell them the truth. [switch POV to CASTIEL standing in NAOMI's office, he's standing, arms crossed.] Do I have to kill her?

NAOMI
She does know the location of the crypts. But working with a demon is... unclean.

CASTIEL
Well, we could use her -- as Crowley did.

NAOMI
Agreed.

INT. MURRAY HOTEL - DAY

MEG
...finding that Angel Tablet. [Close-up of MEG sitting on the bed.]

SAM
Wait a second. Did you just say "Angel Tablet"?

MEG
You know, I get why Crowley calls you "moose" now. Yes -- "Angel Tablet." Crowley found out Lucifer had it, figures it's stashed in a crypt.

CASTIEL
Well, this is news to me, as well. Demons I interrogated, they must have been lying about their true intentions.

DEAN
Really? 'Cause I saw you "Zero Dark Thirty" that demon. You were more than persuasive.

MEG
You're both missing the point. I lied to them, which means they're digging in the wrong place. But not for long. They'll be back here soon. So, who's up for fleeing?

SAM
She's right. We need to find those crypts before they do. Meg, you're the only one who's been there.
CASTIEL
We need your help.

MEG
Any of you dummies got a map? [Chuckles.]

INT. MORTON'S BASEMENT - DAY

MEG
There. That's where the crypt was. [DEAN, SAM, MEG, and CASTIEL are clustered around the miniature village in the MORTON's basement. DEAN and SAM are now wearing jeans, shirts, jackets.]

SAM
What's there now?

MEG
Do I look like Google to you? None of these buildings were here way back in the day. Figure it out, genius. Is there any booze in this dump? [She walks away.]

INT. MORTON'S BASEMENT - DAY
DEAN (V O)
He lied to us. [SAM and DEAN come into view. SAM is seated at the table, working on the laptop. DEAN stands next to him.]

SAM
Yeah, maybe. I can kind of understand why. I mean, an Angel Tablet? [Chuckles.] If the Demon Tablet can shut the Gates of Hell, what can the Angel Tablet do?

INT. MORTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

CASTIEL
These wounds have festered. [CASTIEL wraps gauze around one of MEG's wrists.]

MEG
You really do know how to make a girl's nethers quiver, don't you? [MEG is sitting on the couch, holding an open bottle of booze, she's been cleaned up a bit.]

CASTIEL
I am aware of how to do that. Although it doesn't usually involve cleaning wounds.

MEG
Why are you so sweet on me, Clarence?
CASTIEL
I don't know. And I still don't know who Clarence is.
MEG
Would it kill you to watch a movie, read a book? [She takes a swig directly from the bottle of alcohol.]
CASTIEL
A movie, no. But a book with the proper spells -- yeah, it could, theoretically, kill me.
MEG
You know, you're much cuter when you're shutting up. So, which Cas are you now? Original make and model or crazy town?

CASTIEL
I'm just me.

MEG
So, your noodle's back in order?

CASTIEL
Yeah, my... noodle remembers everything. I think it's a pretty good noodle.

MEG
Really? You remember everything? [She looks fondly at CASTIEL.]

CASTIEL
If you're referring to the pizza man... Yes, I remember the pizza man. And it's a good memory.

INT. MORTON'S BASEMENT - DAY

SAM
Here goes. [SAM highlights a section of the street map on the computer, superimposes it onto a satellite view of the corresponding area.] All right. According to this, the crypt has to be below an abandoned building.

DEAN
Good times. You really think we can trust, uh, Meg-stiel?

SAM
No. But what choice do we have? [We hear the keyboard clacking.]

INT. MORTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

MEG
You ever miss the Apocalypse? [She's drinking the liquor straight from the bottle.]

CASTIEL
No. Why would I miss the end of times?

MEG
I miss the simplicity. I was bad. You were good. Life was easier. Now it's all so messy. I'm kind of good, which sucks. And you're kind of bad -- which is actually all manner of hot. We survive this... I'm gonna order some pizza and we're gonna move some furniture around. You understand?

CASTIEL
No, I-I -- [MEG smiles suggestively] wait -- actually... Yes, I --

DEAN
All right. Let's roll, campers. [DEAN and SAM come into the room, look at MEG and CASTIEL staring at each other, the brothers leave.]

INT. MURRAY HOTEL - DAY
We hear the creak as the room door is opened, our POV is through someone's legs and we see the bodies of the two dead demons lying on the floor. The legs walk forward and it's the third demon who ran away with WENDY RICE's map. The demon flips open his cellphone with a beep.

DEMON # 3
Sir? I, uh, searched the site top to bottom. It's empty. No, there's no crypt there. And, uh, that's not all. It's just me now, sir. [DEMON # 3 is pacing the room, talking on the cellphone.] I, um... We may have lost Meg. [POV standing behind the demon still talking on the cellphone, but now there's someone behind him and that person puts down his cellphone.] Sir? [CROWLEY stands behind DEMON # 3.] Hello, sir?

CROWLEY
Just to be clear... [DEMON # 3 is startled that CROWLEY is behind him, he slowly lowers his cellphone.] ...you can't find a hole in the ground... Your coworkers have met with an untimely demise... ...and you've lost my favorite chew toy. [CROWLEY now is facing DEMON # 3.] Brilliant. What's that old expression? [CROWLEY pulls out a weapon.] "If you want something done right..." [CROWLEY stabs DEMON # 3 who dies with the flash of sparking lights.] ...blah, blah, blah. [CROWLEY pulls the bloody weapon out of the dead demon, it's an angel blade.]
ACT THREE
EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, ALLEY - NIGHT

MEG
So, this is it. Basement?

DEAN
All right, Cas and I will head in and get our Indiana Jones on. Sam, you stay outside with Meg.

SAM
What?

DEAN
We got this.

SAM
What are you talking about, Dean? I'm not letting you go in there alone.

CASTIEL
He won't be alone.

SAM
That's not what I mean. Meg can hang here, watch our backs.

DEAN
Oh, what? Now you trust Meg?

MEG
Hey, I got you this far.

DEAN
Shut up.

SAM
Shut up, Meg. Dean --

DEAN
Sam, I saw your bloody rag in the trash can, okay?

SAM
That wasn't --

DEAN
Stop. Just stop. Sam, we don't know what's in there, okay? And you almost let a demon get the best of you back there.

SAM
I'm fine.

DEAN
No, you're not fine. You haven't been fine since the first trial. That's why I called Cas.

MEG
Trial?

SAM and DEAN
Shut up, Meg.

SAM
Dean, I'm telling you -- I'm okay.

CASTIEL
No, you're not. Sam... You're damaged in ways even I can't heal. Dean's right. You should stay here and protect Meg.

MEG
Since when do I need protecting?

CASTIEL
Since you were held captive and tortured for over a year.

MEG
Touché.

DEAN
All right, we'll be back. [CASTIEL walks away, DEAN hands the demon-killing knife to SAM then walks away too.]

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, BASEMENT - NIGHT

DEAN
Hey, what did you mean back there about Sam? [DEAN, flashlight on, is searching the basement.]

CASTIEL
It's difficult to say. It's something on the subatomic level and his electromagnetic field --

DEAN
Okay, bottom-line it for me, Bill Nye. Is it lethal?

CASTIEL
I don't know. Wait. [They're walking through a darkened corridor when CASTIEL stops, feels the cement wall.] There's a draft. There's something behind there. Stand back. [Hand against the wall, energy flows through his hand, the wall cracks.]

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

MEG
Wait -- so I took how many bullets for you guys, and you didn't even look for me? [MEG and SAM are using spray paint to make symbols on the doors, boarded-up windows, the ground.] Like, once? [Scoffs.] My hero. What's with all the "trial" and "being damaged" crap?

SAM
Look, no disrespect, but you haven't exactly been the most, uh, trustworthy person in our lives, Meg.

MEG
You're not gonna tell me? Seriously? How am I not team Sam? [We hear SAM's can rattle and hiss as he continues to spray paint. MEG scoffs.] Fine. Whatever it is, you okay dying over it? [SAM shakes his can again.] You don't want to say, fine. But remember, I spent time in that walking corpse of yours. I know your sad, little thoughts and feelings.

SAM
That's creepy.

MEG
Here's what I remember. Deep down, in parts you never let see the light of day, you want to live a long, normal life away from creepy old things like me.

SAM
I do. [Scoffs.] You know, I spent last year with... someone, and, um... ...now I know that's actually possible.

MEG
Wait -- that's how you spent your last year? With a chick? Lame.

SAM
You know, how about we just wait quietly? [SAM's can rattles.]

MEG
What was her name? You don't even trust me with a name? Cut me, do I not bleed, Sam? So, some chick actually got you off hunting, huh? That's one rare creature. Tell me -- how'd you meet this unicorn?

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

CASTIEL and DEAN are in a dusty, dirty crypt with a vaulted ceiling, CASTIEL is standing watching while DEAN shines his flashlight looking around the room. There are ancient artifacts lying around, everything is covered with dust, spider webs. Close-up of CASTIEL's face.

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CASTIEL
I found it. [CASTIEL opens the glass door to NAOMI's office.]

NAOMI
Tell the Winchester the crypt is empty. Then you can come back --

CASTIEL
It's warded against angels. [He stands there, holding the door open.]
NAOMI
Well, you can come back --

CASTIEL
Crowley's demons are still in town, and we're running out of time. What should I do? [He is inside NAOMI's office, the glass door closes.]

NAOMI
Handle it.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

CASTIEL
Dean... [POV switches back to the crypt. CASTIEL points towards an item on a shelf against the wall.] That's it. [DEAN shines his flashlight on a carved, wooden chest.]

DEAN
How do you know?

CASTIEL
It's the only thing in here warded against angels. [DEAN picks up the heavy object and places it on the table in front of CASTIEL. DEAN picks up a small dagger, pries open the lid. He reaches in and lifts out a rather large block of stone.]

DEAN
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

CASTIEL
Good. Hand it to me, and I'll take it to heaven.

DEAN
No, we will take it to Kevin so he can translate. [DEAN holds the block of stone using both hands.]

CASTIEL
Right. Of course. I'll take it to him right away. No time to waste.

DEAN
Well, he's not that far. I've been meaning to... go check on him, bring him some supplies.

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

NAOMI
If the demons get their hands on the Angel Tablet, they'll kill us all. They'll destroy heaven.

CASTIEL
I can reason with Dean. He's a good man.

NAOMI
Kill him.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

CASTIEL
I can resupply the Prophet, Dean.

DEAN
You know, why don't, uh, why don't Sam and I take it over to him, and you can get back to your mission? Finding the other half of the Demon Tablet -- that is priority, isn't it?

CASTIEL
I can't let you take that, Dean.

DEAN
Can't or won't?

CASTIEL
Both.

DEAN
How did you get out of Purgatory, Cas?

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CASTIEL
There has to be another way.

NAOMI
You have done this a thousand times, Castiel. You're ready. Kill him. Then take the tablet and bring it home, where it belongs.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

DEAN
Just tell me how you got out of Purgatory. Be honest with me -- for the first time since you've been back -- [DEAN nods towards the stone he's still holding] and this is yours. [CASTIEL's blade drops into his hand.]

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

MEG
Wait -- h-hold on. There's one part I don't understand. You hit a dog and stopped. Why?

SAM
That whole story, and that's your takeaway?

MEG
Oh, I heard the rest. You fell in love with a unicorn. It was beautiful, then sad, then sadder. I laughed, I cried, I puked in my mouth a little. And honestly, I kind of get it.

SAM
Really?

MEG
We've got company.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT
Close-up of the angel blade in CASTIEL's hand.

DEAN
Cas. Cas, I don't know what the hell is wrong with you, but if you're in there and you can hear me, you don't have to do this. [CASTIEL attacks, DEAN blocks the blow with the stone.] Cas! [Flashes of light, thunder rumbles.]

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CASTIEL
This isn't right. [CASTIEL paces around the room anxiously.]

NAOMI
Do you realize what that tablet can do for us?

CASTIEL
I...

NAOMI
For heaven?


CASTIEL
I won't hurt Dean.

NAOMI
Yes. You will. You are.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT
DEAN
Cas, fight this! This is not you! Fight it! [CASTIEL strikes again, DEAN again uses the stone to block the blow. Thunder rumbles.]

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT
CASTIEL
What have you done to me?! [He's holding his head, gasping.]

NAOMI
Just relax, Castiel. Let your vessel do what you know deep down is the right thing.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

CASTIEL
What have you done to me, Naomi?

DEAN
Who's Naomi?!

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

NAOMI
What have I done to you?! Do you have any idea what it's like out there? There's blood everywhere, and it's on your hands. After everything you did -- to us, to heaven. I fixed you, Castiel. I fixed you! [She is furious.]

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

SAM and MEG turn towards two demons who are charging and carrying clubs. The demons attack.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

DEAN
Cas! [DEAN puts his hand on CASTIEL's shoulder. CASTIEL backhands DEAN who is thrown into a wall and falls to the floor.]

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

MEG and SAM are still fighting the demons. SAM takes out one demon, he appears unsteady. He stands and watches as MEG kills the second demon.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

CASTIEL is attacking DEAN. DEAN throws a punch, CASTIEL grabs his forearm and breaks it. We hear the bone snap, DEAN drops the stone, it shatters, revealing the tablet that was encased within. Lightning flashes.

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

MEG pulls the blade out of the body of the dead demon, she and SAM look around as lightning flashes and thunder rumbles.

CROWLEY
I believe they're playing my song.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

CASTIEL is beating DEAN. DEAN's face is bruised and bloodied.

DEAN
You want it? [CASTIEL looks dispassionately at the now exposed tablet.] Take it! But you're gonna have to kill me first. Come on, you coward. Do it. Do it! [CASTIEL continues to beat DEAN.]

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CASTIEL, blade in hand, smacks NAOMI'S desk.

CASTIEL
Please.

NAOMI
End this, Castiel.

CASTIEL raises his fist in NAOMI's office.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

CASTIEL's fist follows through with a brutal punch to DEAN.

DEAN
Cas... This isn't you. This isn't you. [CASTIEL raises his fist to attack DEAN again.]

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

POV, CASTIEL beats NAOMI's desk.

NAOMI
Bring me the tablet!

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

DEAN
Ohh! [DEAN, seriously beaten and bloody, now has one eye swollen shut.] Cas. Cas. [Weakly, reaching towards CASTIEL.] I know you're in there. [CASTIEL raises his angel blade, ready to strike.] I know you can hear me. Cas... [DEAN's voice breaks, pleading.] It's me. [CASTIEL stands there, blade at the ready, light glints off the blade.] We're family. We need you. I need you.

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

NAOMI
You have to choose, Castiel -- us or them.

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

DEAN
Cas. [CASTIEL drops the blade with a clang. DEAN groans and pants in pain. CASTIEL reaches down for the angel tablet, as he picks it up, the Enochian writing begins to glow, the light flows up his arm, surrounding his entire being, the room, DEAN.]

INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT
NAOMI
Aah! Aah! [NAOMI is covered with the bright light and she throws up her arm to shield her face as she flinches back and away from the intense brightness.]

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT
POV, DEAN sits on the floor covered with the bright light but he barely raises one arm to protect himself.
INT. NAOMI'S OFFICE - NIGHT
POV, NAOMI's office as the light fades away.

NAOMI
Castiel! Castiel!!

ACT FOUR
INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT
CASTIEL is holding the angel tablet, standing over DEAN.

DEAN
Cas? [Breathing heavily, he's horribly beaten.] Cas? [CASTIEL reaches his hand towards DEAN.] No. Cas. Cas! [CASTIEL places his hand on the side of DEAN's head, DEAN gasps, and is suddenly healed.]

CASTIEL
I'm so sorry, Dean.

DEAN
What the hell just happened? [All trace of the beating is gone.]

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

CROWLEY
Love what you've done with the place. You really think all that was gonna keep me out forever?

SAM
At least long enough for Dean and Cas to get the tablet and get out.

CROWLEY
Castiel. So, that's who's been poking my boys -- and not in a sexy way. Got a bone to pick with you, moose. After what you did to my poor dog.

MEG
You gonna talk us to death or get down to it already?

CROWLEY
There's my whore. I'm not here for my dearly departed, though. I'm here for the stone with the funny scribbles on it.

SAM
That's not gonna happen.

CROWLEY
Love it when you get all tough. Touches me right where my bathing suit goes. [CROWLEY pulls out a shiny angel blade.]

MEG
Go. Save your brother... and my unicorn. [SAM leaves, opens the warehouse door.]

CROWLEY
Timon and Pumbaa... [We hear the door close] ...tell you their big plan? Did they share that little chestnut with you? They mean to close the Gates of Hell, sweetheart. They mean to kill me and all the demons -- you included.

MEG
You had me at "kill you," Crowley. [She smiles, CROWLEY strikes.]

INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT

DEAN
So, this "Naomi" has been controlling you since she got you out of Purgatory?

CASTIEL
Yeah.

DEAN
Well, w-what broke the connection?

CASTIEL
I don't know. I just know that I have to protect this tablet now.

DEAN
From Naomi?

CASTIEL
Yes. And from you.

DEAN
From me? What are you talking about? [CASTIEL and the tablet are suddenly gone, the sound rumbles through the crypt.] Cas? Cas! Damn it.

SAM (V O)
Dean! [SAM comes barreling into the crypt.] Dean. Where's Cas?

DEAN
He's gone. Meg?

SAM
We got to go -- now.

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

POV, a newly beaten and bloody MEG lifts herself up from the wet ground. CROWLEY reaches down, grabs her by the jacket, pulls her up.

CROWLEY
I could beat on you for eternity.

MEG
Take all the time you want, you pig. [She's weak, but defiant. She and CROWLEY look back as we hear the car doors open, then close.]

MEG
No Cas in the back seat. Your stone is long gone. [MEG stabs CROWLEY in the shoulder using the angel blade, sparks fly.]

CROWLEY
Aah! [He gasps, he grabs the blade and stabs MEG. SAM and DEAN look back as the demon MEG dies. Tires squeal as the car speeds away.]

ACT FIVE
INT. BASEMENT, CRYPT - NIGHT
Scene opens with CROWLEY standing between the table and the far wall.

CROWLEY
Naomi. Fancy meeting you here. [NAOMI comes into view, her back framed in the archway.] Haven't seen you in a dark age. Love the haircut.

NAOMI
How's the shoulder?

CROWLEY
Just a flesh wound. Now, I don't have the tablet, and if you're here, neither do you. Which means that your Castiel is in the wind with our prize. If I didn't know you better, I'd say you're losing your touch.

NAOMI
Castiel isn't in the wind. He's doing exactly what he's supposed to do -- protect the tablet.

CROWLEY
Even from you? Easy, love. If you remember our time in Mesopotamia the way I do, you know I'm a lover, not a fighter.

NAOMI
What do you want, you cockroach?

CROWLEY
Maybe we can make a deal before this gets truly bollocksed. I mean, I must have something that you want. [He scoffs when she just disappears.] Tart stole my move.

EXT. IMPALA - NIGHT
POV, the brothers are in the IMPALA, DEAN is driving.

SAM
So... what happened? I mean, Cas touched the tablet, and it reset him to his factory settings or something?

DEAN
I don't know. And I don't care. All I know is that he is off the reservation with a-a heavenly WMD. Listen, man, I can't take any more lies -- from anyone.

SAM
Yeah. Um... I know. I'm sorry. I should have told you. I-I... just wanted to believe I was okay. I don't know.

DEAN
Well, you heard what Cas said -- that that first trial hurt you in ways that even he can't heal. Sammy, I need you to be honest with me from here on out, man.

SAM
You're right. And I will be.

DEAN
Listen, I may not be able to carry the burden that comes along with these trials... But I can carry you.

SAM
You... realize you kind of just quoted "Lord of the Rings," right?

DEAN
Come on, man. But it's the Rudy Hobbit, all right? Rudy Hobbit always gets a pass. [SAM chuckles.] Shut up. [DEAN turns on the radio, Supertramp's "Goodbye Stranger" is playing.]

EXT. BUS - DAY

CASTIEL is sitting on a moving bus, the angel tablet in his hands. He puts the tablet into a bag, closes the zipper. Scene pulls back, shows CASTIEL seated in the third row from the back of the bus, we see other passengers. Overhead shot of the "Greyhound"-type bus heading down the highway to the strains of Supertramp, it goes into a tunnel.
