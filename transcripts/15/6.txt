--NOW--

[INTERIOR, Aradia Apartments, the hallway outside Rowena's apartment, the floor to either side of the door strewn with mail, a woman approaches the door and knocks]

JACINDA: Mrs. MacLeod? It's Jessie, from 3C? Haven't seen you in a while. Everything okay?

[she crouches down and whispers next to the lock, and the door opens]

JACINDA: Aperiatur.

[she looks around Rowena's apartment]

JACINDA: Okay. Game on. Come on! Where is the good stuff?

[Jacinda proceeds to ransack the apartment, tossing books and smashing bottles, until she leans across Rowena's desk and her nose and eyes begin to bleed. She realizes she's been cursed, tries to stagger toward the door, but it's too late and she falls dead to the floor]


--TITLE CARD--


ACT 1
[INTERIOR: Bunker kitchen. Sam sits at the table with his laptop. Dean strolls in wearing pajamas and his robe and holding an empty cereal box]

DEAN: Hey.

SAM: Hey.

DEAN: You know they still put, um, jokes on the backs of these things. Listen to this one... What's round and bad-tempered? "A vicious circle." 'Cause it's...

SAM: Yeah, I... I... Wait a second, did you eat the whole box?

DEAN: Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm a champion.

SAM: Wait a second. So I've been looking for signs of... of God or... or Lilith, and you've been in your room, eating cereal.

DEAN: And marathoning "Scooby-Doo". Well, did you find anything?

SAM: No, not yet.

DEAN: Shocker.

[Dean eats cereal out of a fresh box of Muesli, spits it out, and instaed grabs another box of Cocoa Crunch]

SAM: Hey, did you notice anything weird just now when you came in?

DEAN: No. Why, did you have another one of your visions?

SAM: No. I haven't had a vision since Colorado. I think maybe they stopped.

DEAN: Oh, I doubt it. Not until Chuck gets his end game, you know? The Winchester Bowl. Cain and Abel 2.0. This is God we're talking about. G-O-D. Wouldn't be too worried about finding him. He'll find us.


[EXTERIOR: Simmzy's Bait and Tackle Shop. Cas walks up to the front door, but it's locked. The owner, Andy, walks up and greets him, opening the store]

ANDY: Hey, Clarence.

CASTIEL: Morning.

ANDY: Come on in, early bird. Well... What can I do for ya? Bait working out good?

CASTIEL: Oh, yeah. The... Bait's good. I think it's the fish. They've begun to anticipate me.

ANDY: Yeah, fish can be smart. I'd switch up spots. Maps are over there.

[Cas browses through the map rack and picks up a tourist map of the lake, while Andy pours whiskey into his coffee cup]

CASTIEL: I had a friend who always praised fishing for its meditative qualities. Wish I found it more relaxing. Andy... is everything all right?

ANDY: Oh, uh... I'm, uh, volunteer fire department. We pulled a body out of the lake this morning. Missing kid. Shane Coogan.

CASTIEL: I'm sorry.

ANDY: Yeah. You know, not my first dead body, but... Ah, the way he looked, I guessed he drowned. Except he was juiced.

CASTIEL: Juiced?

ANDY: Mm. Like drained, like, of his blood. Weird, huh? Is that everything for you?

CASTIEL: Yeah.


[EXTERIOR, Sam jogs along a path through the forest, past a lake, when his breath fogs over and he stops, looking around for something supernatural. Eileen materializes just off the trail]

SAM: Eileen?

EILEEN: Hi, Sam.


[INTERIOR, the bunker library]

DEAN: So, you were in Hell? You didn't make a deal. You were innocent. You've been down there this whole time?

EILEEN: The Hellhound that killed me kind of dragged me there.

DEAN: Damn.

SAM: Yeah, um, she escaped when, uh, Chuck blew all the doors open, and then...

EILEEN: I hauled ass. Far as I could.

DEAN: So by the time we got the barrier up, you were already gone.

EILEEN: Been trying to get you guys to see me for a while now. This whole ghost thing doesn't really come with a handbook. Look, I don't know how all this works, but I know how it ends. We go crazy. We hurt people. I can't stay here, and I won't go back down there. So I thought... You guys know angels. Maybe if you put in a good word, you know, up there...

DEAN: Eileen, even if we did, it wouldn't matter. Souls from Hell can't go to Heaven. A friend of ours just found that out. I'm sorry.

EILEEN: Yeah. Me too.


[INTERIOR, bunker hallway, Sam follows after Dean]

SAM: Nice, man. Real sensitive.

DEAN: You want me to sugarcoat it?

SAM: No, I don't want... of course not. But, Dean...

DEAN: There may be an Option B. Do we have any of those soul catchers, you know, like the ones we used in Harlan?

SAM: You want to trap Eileen in a prison full of psycho ghosts?

DEAN: No, no, no. Not with them. We'd... We'd make her her own, you know? Look, it's better than where she was, and it's better than where she's going.

SAM: Dean, that spell... it's not exactly easy.

DEAN: Okay, but, you know, you're like, uh, Rowena's protégé. You're a regular Ginger Jr.

SAM: Even if I could, I would need a crystal. I mean, those were Rowena's thing.

DEAN: Okay. Look, man, this blows. I get it. I don't make the rules. A soul from Hell can't go to Heaven.

SAM: All right, look, if it's what Eileen wants, then... Maybe we can go to Rowena's place and look for a crystal, or something. I've been meaning to go there anyways after, uh... You know.

DEAN: Great. Do that.

SAM: Wait, wait. You're not coming with?

DEAN: It's a milk run.

SAM: You're... You know what, Dean, ever since God got back, you've been acting like there's nothing we can do, like nothing matters, but we can do this. Man, this matters.

DEAN: And that's why you're gonna kick it in the ass.


[INTERIOR, Sheriff's office]

CASTIEL: When will the Sheriff be back?

SECRETARY: Five minutes? An hour? It's Tuesday, Agent. He gets his hair cut on Tuesday.

CASTIEL: He gets his hair... I see.

MELLY: You're FBI? I thought you were renting the Doweling cabin. Uh, small town...

CASTIEL: Uh... I'm, uh... I'm on vacation.

MELLY: But you're looking into that missing boy, the one that they found in the lake?

CASTIEL: Do you know him?

MELLY: Uh, no, but I... I think my son's missing, too. Um... I... I let him camp out last night, and he was supposed to be back first thing this morning.

SECRETARY: Honey, it's only a few hours. He'll turn up.

MELLY: She thinks I'm overreacting because this town, it's like a postcard, but now, with that other boy, I just... I... I need to find my son.

CASTIEL: Right.

MELLY: Please, um, Agent, um...

CASTIEL: Um... Worley.

MELLY: Can you help me?

CASTIEL: Of course.


[EXTERIOR, SureGas station, as Sam fills up the Impala's tank]

SAM: I... I'm sorry. I wish there was more we could do. I hate this for you.

EILEEN: Whatever that crystal is, I'll take it. At least I won't be... you know.

SAM: Yeah. I've been there, too... uh, Hell. A long time ago. You try and forget, but it gets inside you. Talking helps.

EILEEN: I can't. Not yet.

SAM [out loud and signed]: I understand.

EILEEN [out loud and signed]: Not bad. I'm impressed.

SAM: After we met, I started practicing again. I guess some of it stuck.


[INTERIOR, Rowena's apartment, Sam and Eileen discover it's been ransacked and find Jacinda's body on the floor. The mirror on the wall seems to shimmer]

EILEEN: Who's she?

SAM: I don't know.


[INTERIOR, a moving van marked "Keep 'er Movin', you GO we PACK". Inside, the van is decorated lavishly, and two witches spy on Sam and Eileen via the mirror in Rowena's apartment.

WITCH MOTHER: Well, look at you.


ACT 2
[INTERIOR, Rowena's apartment, Sam crouches down to examine Jacinda's body, and notices a tattoo on her neck]

SAM: Wait a second.

EILEEN: She was goth?

SAM: No, close. I recognize that. It's from the "Ordo maleficarum".

EILEEN: A witch.

SAM: Yeah. Looks like she tore this place apart. I mean, maybe she got into something she shouldn't have.

EILEEN: Great.

SAM: Okay, let's just find what we're looking for and get out of here.


[INTERIOR, Sheriff's office, Cas is finally meeting with Sheriff Roy]

SHERIFF ROY: Melly Krokowski. From the day that woman graced us with her presence, it's always something... too much fluoride in the water, not enough vegan options at the 4th of July parade, that we even have the 4th of July parade.

CASTIEL: Sheriff, her son is missing.

SHERIFF ROY: And maybe if this were New York, I'd be worried. Here? A teenager stays out too long, he's probably with his buddies sobering up.

CASTIEL: So people rarely go missing here?

SHERIFF ROY: I mean, not locals. But it is a tourist town. Some years, we lose a hiker. Somebody drowns.

CASTIEL: Like Shane Coogan?

SHERIFF ROY: No.

SHERIFF ROY: Shane came out for last year's Bluegrass festival. Parents raised a big stink, but locals saw him holed up in the woods. Opioids. Wound up in the lake. O.D.'d.

CASTIEL: I'd like to take a look at the body.

SHERIFF ROY: Already on its way to Cheyenne. We don't have an M.E.

CASTIEL: Well, any case work you do have will be fine.

SHERIFF ROY: Which office you say you were from again, Agent Worley?

CASTIEL: Special Agent. D.C.

SHERIFF ROY: You got a supervisor I could talk to, make it official?

[intercut scene between the sheriff's office and the bunker. A phone rings in the war room, and Dean searches through a tangle of charging cell phones for the one labeled FBI, and answers]

DEAN: This is Assistant Director Kaiser.

SHERIFF ROY: Uh... This is Sheriff Alden Roy. Just checking on Agent Worley.

DEAN: Would you put my agent on the phone, please?

SHERIFF ROY [handing the phone to Cas]: He wants to talk to you.

CASTIEL: Hello?

DEAN: Cas. Sam's been trying to call you.

CASTIEL: I know.

DEAN: Did you check his messages?

CASTIEL: Nope.

DEAN: Right. Smart. Why would you? Look, I don't know if you care or not, but, uh... God... Chuck... is back on the board, so watch yourself. And check your damn messages.

[Dean hangs up the phone. Cas pretends to keep talking to him for a moment]

CASTIEL: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

SHERIFF ROY: I'll get you those files.

CASTIEL: Thank you.


[INTERIOR: Rowena's apartment, the portrait of Rowena watches on]

EILEEN: This is just junk.

SAM: Tarot cards, self-help books. Where's her real stash? [Eileen notices something odd about a bookcase, and walks through the wall] Eileen?

EILEEN: Sam? In here. [Sam pushes open the bookcase, a hidden door to Rowena's secret lab] Ta-da! [Sam is overwhelmed as he explores, and finds Rowena's books] Sam?

SAM: Uh... She kept journals.

EILEEN: Rowena?

SAM: Yeah. Her spell work. All of it. Right up until the end.

EILEEN: You miss her.

SAM: I killed her. Her idea. She, uh, sacrificed herself to save us. To... To save the world. You ever feel like you're the punchline to some cosmic joke?

EILEEN: Are you kidding?

[Eileen reaches out and attempts to lay her hand on Sam's, but it passes right through]

SAM: Rowena got it. I mean, she didn't know all the details, but she knew the game was rigged. So this... Magic. This is how she kept control.

[Emotional, Sam fumbles the pages of the journal he's holding, and bends down to pick them up]

SAM: No way.

EILEEN: Sam. What's going on?

SAM: Okay. When my mom was killed, uh, Rowena tried to bring her back, but she couldn't. She needed a body, which we didn't have. Turns out, Rowena was working on a way to bring her back, a way around that, a-a way to make the spirit flesh.

EILEEN: She didn't use it?

SAM: We ended up finding out my mom was in Heaven already and happy, so... She never finished it. But... I think I can finish it.

EILEEN: So?

SAM: So... Eileen, we can bring you back.


[INTERIOR, Sheriff's office, Cas pores over the files, marking the locations of disappearances on his fishing map]


[EXTERIOR, parking lot at Rowena's apartment, Sam loads Rowena's books into the trunk of the Impala]

SAM: All right. That's everything.

[Sam shuts the trunk and begins coughing blood, and collapses to the ground. He crawls around the Impala, searching the wheel wells until he finds a hex bag]

EILEEN: Sam? Sam? What's happening?

[The two witches from the moving van close in on them as Sam's vision blurs]

SAM [signing to Eileen]: My brother.

[One of the witches waves and hand and banishes Eileen with a spell]

WITCH MOTHER: Umbra, abi. Hello, Sam.


ACT 3
[INTERIOR, the witches' moving van, Sam recovers from the spell he'd been under and his vision slowly clears]

SAM: Who are you?

WITCH MOTHER: Rowena MacLeod is dead. We came for what she left behind, and just when we thought we wouldn't get it... You come along. Hmm. Lucky us.

SAM: What?

WITCH MOTHER: The apartment's hexed. It's potent magic. Anyone who steps insides dies. Except, apparently, you. Mm-hmm. Surprised? Yeah. Me too. I only know Rowena by reputation. Respect, but... To imagine her leaving all her Earthly treasures to you...

SAM: So the body we found... That was one of yours.

WITCH MOTHER: Mm. Jacinda, my oldest. She's young. She'll learn.

SAM: Now you're gonna bring her back.

WITCH MOTHER: Well, of course I am, yeah. This is good magic.

SAM: Listen, you need me.

WITCH MOTHER: Hmm.

SAM: You want Rowena's stuff? I can get it for you. But I need that spell.

WITCH MOTHER: Oh. Hm. I'm sorry, no. I'd never give up my girl.

SAM: Okay, then we'll both use it.

WITCH MOTHER: We can't. A spell like this, you can only use once. Show Death a loophole, and she closes it. And, well, I think you'll help us anyway. Emily.

EMILY [to Sam]: Borrowed some of your hair.

[the Witch Mother winds Sam's hair around a voodoo doll]

WITCH MOTHER: Hmm. Now, a choice... you can do as you're told and die quick. Or you can play tough and... [She squeezes the voodoo doll and Sam cringes in pain] Oh. ... and die slowly. It's up to you.

EMILY: Hm.


[EXTERIOR, the edge of the forest by Jenny Lake, Cas studies his map as Melly catches up to him]

MELLY: Okay, so I followed you.

CASTIEL: Melly, you shouldn't be here.

MELLY: Please, Agent Worley, you have to let me help. I told Caleb to get off "Fortnite", to get some fresh air.

CASTIEL: This isn't your fault.

MELLY: What are those X's?

CASTIEL: They're where they found... A number of people have gone missing in this area.

MELLY: And you think Caleb... No, he wouldn't come out here. He knows it's not safe. With the mine?

CASTIEL: Mine?

MELLY: Yeah, the old silver mine.The EPA shut it down in the '70s... toxic runoff.

CASTIEL: Can you show me where it is?

MELLY: No. But I can take you.

CASTIEL: Okay. Stay close.


[INTERIOR, Rowena's apartment. Sam goes inside while Emily waits at the threshold with her voodoo doll]

SAM: It's Emily, right? Is this your thing, robbing dead people?

EMILY: No talking.

[She stabs the doll with a pin, and Sam flinches in pain]

SAM: Right.

EMILY: Make it quick, just the good stuff.

[Sam notices Emily staring at her sister's body on the floor]

SAM: Hey, I can look for something to cover her up.

EMILY: Do you think she's pretty? Everyone thinks she's pretty.

SAM: I mean, uh, she's dead.

EMILY: For now.

SAM: Were you close?

EMILY: She made my life hell.

SAM: Really? What did she do? Listen, I get it. All right? I mean, I... I have an older brother. When I was 10, he... he put superglue in my toothpaste.

EMILY: Yeah?

SAM: Yeah.

EMILY: Once, she made me invisible... for a week.

SAM: Okay, well, that's not so...

EMILY: And she tried to sell my soul to a demon and she turned my first crush into a water balloon... and popped him.

SAM: Oh.

EMILY: And then she got mean. Start packing.


[EXTERIOR, footpath in the forest by Jenny Lake]

CASTIEL: Are we close?

MELLY: I think so. Thanks for doing this on your vacation.

CASTIEL: Well, it's not really a... I needed to step away.

MELLY: Burnout's a bitch, right?

CASTIEL: Yeah. My colleagues and I, we, uh... I guess you could say we had a falling out with management.

MELLY: Trust me, I get it. I used to work in finance. Back in '08, all the bosses promised big changes, but nothing really changes, so I cashed out, took the kid, moved here. Thing is, taking yourself out of the game doesn't really change the game. But I had to, for Caleb, who says moving here ruined his life. Half the time, we're at each other's throats.

CASTIEL: Well, I'm sorry.

MELLY: No, we'll get through it.

CASTIEL: Melly, you have to prepare yourself for something.

MELLY: What?

CASTIEL: There are things in this world that aren't human. Shane Coogan was killed by one, a djinn, I think.

MELLY: I'm sorry, a what?

CASTIEL: Monsters are real, and, given the number of missing people in the area, I think this mine may be a lair, and, if it is, I don't want you to see what's inside.

MELLY: But I don't want...

CALEB: Mom? Mom?

MELLY: Caleb!

CASTIEL: Oh!


[INTERIOR, Rowena's apartment]

EMILY: Steve was a good bunny. But Jessie needed his bones, so.

SAM: Yeah. Sorry, that's, uh... Wow.

EMILY: I yelled at her, and she turned my tongue into a snake. I still have the scars where it bit me.

SAM: You know what? Listen. She doesn't have to come back. All right? You heard your mom. That spell only works once. If you give it to me...

EMILY: She'd kill me.

SAM: Not if you ran. Rowena was a very powerful witch, maybe the most powerful of all time. I'll give you her books, her journals... whatever you want. Y-You could go somewhere else, start over again.

EMILY: Liar! [she stabs the doll again, hard enough that Sam falls to the ground]


[EXTERIOR, the hiking trail, Cas and Melly help Caleb to a more comfortable place to sit]

CALEB: I know... I know I wasn't supposed to be out here, but I...

MELLY: It's okay, honey. Just tell us what happened.

CALEB: You're not gonna believe me.

CASTIEL: Yes, we will.

CALEB: I saw some guy dragging a dead body to the lake. I couldn't see his face, so I grabbed my phone, I tried to bust his ass, but... It was a monster. I-I ran, but I fell, I broke my phone and messed up my ankle. I was hiding. I was so scared.

CASTIEL: The monster... did you get a good look at it?

SHERIFF ROY: Yeah, he did. Unfortunately. Been looking for you. I try not to kill more than I have to, but now you and the kid are just such a big pain in my ass.

CASTIEL: You won't hurt them.

[Cas drops his angel blade into his hand, and Sheriff Roy's eyes glow and his djinn tattoos become visible]

SHERIFF ROY: That right?

[Sheriff Roy shoots Cas in the chest, but Cas heals it almost immediately, and walks toward the sheriff]

CALEB: Whoa. Whoa.

CASTIEL: It's always you... you selfish little men in positions of authority. You take what you want, you take who you want. And you believe that your power will protect you. [Sheriff Roy shoots him in the heart, point blank, and Cas heals it again] Well, it won't protect you from me.

[Cas wrenches his gun away, punches him, and then stabs the djinn to death while Melly and Caleb hold one another and cry]


ACT 4
[INTERIOR, Rowena's apartment, Sam carries a box filled with Rowena's things]

EMILY: Let's go. Don't make me hurt you.

[She holds up the doll again, but before she can stab it, Dean barges in holding the Witch Mother at gunpoint]

DEAN: Witch-killing bullets.

SAM: Dean, wait, she's...

[Emily stabs the voodoo doll, and Sam collapses in agony]

EMILY: Let her go, or he dies.

DEAN: Well, it looks like we got ourselves a little bit of a stand-off. Two on two.

[the lights flicker, Dean's breath freezes, and Jacinda's ghost appears and flings Dean down the hall]

WITCH MOTHER: More like two on three.

[Sam swats the doll away from Emily, but the Witch Mother begins hexing him, causing him pain, wile the other two close on Dean]

WITCH MOTHER: Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. [to Emily] The doll! Kill him! Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre.

[Emily picks up the doll and twists it violently. Eileen appears between Jacinda and Dean, and flings her down the hallway]

EILEEN: Not today, bitch.

DEAN: About time.

[Eileen grins and nods at Dean, and then flickers and reappears beside Jacinda in Rowena's apartment. They fight.]

WITCH MOTHER: Ad elicienda alvos. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Ad elicienda alvos. Torto ventre. Congelentur venae.

[Dean is able to retrieve his gun, and shoots Emily in the chest, and the Witch Mother turns her attention on Dean]

WITCH MOTHER: Cor marcascatur et in thorace concidatur. I'll grind your heart to dust. Congelentur venae. Cor marcascatur et in thorace concidatur. Con...

[Sam tackles the Witch Mother, and pulls out a tiny hex bag]

WITCH MOTHER: You... How?

SAM: I learned from the best.

[flashback to Sam packing up Rowena's things for Emily, pocketing ingredients for a hex bag along the way]

EMILY: Start packing.

[Sam crams it in her mouth and recites a spell]

SAM: O Ichor, igne putrefaciatur, ex sanguine flagrante, te invoco.

[Dean notices Eileen is still fighting with Jacinda's ghost]

DEAN: Eileen!

EILEEN: Her... Her body!

[Dean douses her body in alcohol and pulls out his lighter]

DEAN: Come on.

[Jacinda's ghost burns]


ACT 5
[EXTERIOR, the forest, Castiel returns to Melly and Caleb]

MELLY: So you...

CASTIEL: Dropped him in the lake. I think I can help. May I?

[Cas crouches down and heals Caleb's bruised ankle. His grace flickers and he struggles to heal the minor injury, and Cas is woozy and winded when he finishes]

CALEB: Holy crap! What... What?

MELLY: That's a... miracle. Were you sent by God?

CASTIEL: Melly, I can't explain it to you. I... Well, even if I could, I think you're better off not knowing.

MELLY: What does that mean?

CASTIEL: It means I'm happy I met you, and I'm glad we found your son.

MELLY: But now you're leaving.

CASTIEL: Yeah. If I stay, nothing changes. It's time for me to get back in the game.


[INTERIOR, the bunker. Sam draws a bath and prepares the spell while Eileen watches]

EILEEN: Okay, so... I just, um... get in?

SAM: Yeah. I guess. Then I say the words.

[Eileen gets in the tub, Sam turns his back and recites the spell]

SAM: Mortuum oritur. Rutum revertitur. Ex spiritu incarnatum est. Oriatur et educatur. Oriatur et educatur.

[Eileen emerges from the water naked, but alive again, she wraps herself in a towel and steps out of the tub]

SAM: Eileen?

EILEEN: Sam? [she walks over to him, and signs] Thank you.

[She takes Sam's hand, and is able to hold it now. She hugs him]


[INTERIOR, the war room. Dean sits with his feet up drinking a beer]

DEAN: How's Eileen?

SAM: She, uh... She's asleep. She had a big day.

DEAN: Well, so did you. Hex bags. New body. So, what, are you some kind of witch now?

[Dean rolls a beer across the table to Sam as he sits down]

SAM: Nah, I got lucky.

DEAN: Yeah. I just wish we knew about that spell for Mom. You did good today, man. I did jack.

SAM: You killed a witch, saved my ass.

DEAN: Yeah, I guess so.

SAM: You know what, I've been thinking about something you said, about how we don't make the rules, and you're right. We don't. We never have. But that doesn't mean we can just give up.

DEAN: Oh, come on, man.

SAM: We have moves to make here, Dean. We do. I mean, you think Chuck wanted me to shoot him? Of course not.

DEAN: You sure about that? Maybe that was part of the plan, you know? That's the thing, man. I don't know what's God and what isn't, and it's driving me crazy.

SAM: All I'm saying is we'll find a way to beat him. We will. I don't know how yet, but we will 'cause we're the guys who break the rules. But I can't do it without you. I can't. Just like I couldn't do it today without you. I need my brother.
