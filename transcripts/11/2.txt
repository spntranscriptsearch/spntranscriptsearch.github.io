TITLE SCENE

Ext. Rural farmland. The Impala pulls into a driveway and Dean and Jenna get out, with Amara.

DEAN: Well, nice neighborhood.

JENNA: Yeah. I pretty much grew up here. Learned to ride my bike down the road. Had my first kiss at that blue house over there. Lost my virginity up there.

DEAN: I'll bet blue house was pissed.

JENNA: She was. (handing Amara to Dean) Do you mind?

DEAN: Yeah. Hey, beautiful.

JENNA: Anyway . . . That's why I asked you to bring us here. After everything that happened, it just feels safe.

DEAN: Well, good. Safe is good. (to Amara) Shh, shh, shh, shh!

JENNA: You're so great with her.

DEAN: Well, what can I say? Chicks dig me. Well, look, I should, uh . . .

JENNA: Right. Sure.

DEAN: You're gonna be okay, both of you.

JENNA: I know. What about you and Sam? Are you gonna be okay?

DEAN: Well, for us, the bar's pretty low. See ya.

JENNA: Dean. Thank you . . . For everything.

GRANDMA: (Jenna’s grandmother has come out on the porch.) Jenna!

(Dean leaves and Jenna goes into the house.)

JENNA: Hi, grandma.

GRANDMA: After you called, they did a big report on the news. That weatherman I don't like with the big teeth, he said some kind of freak storm hit Superior.

JENNA: Yeah. It was . . . crazy.

GRANDMA: Well, don't you worry. If that thing rolls our way, I've got a generator and enough canned green beans to last till Judgment Day.

JENNA: Good to know.

GRANDMA: And this must be Amara. Oh. What a little angel.

JENNA: Yeah. She's a miracle.

GRANDMA: And her folks?

JENNA: It's a long story.

GRANDMA: Well, then it can wait till after your nap.

JENNA: My what?

GRANDMA: When's the last time you slept? Because -- and I mean this is the nicest possible way -- you look like poop on parade. Now, I made up the guest bedroom, and I got your father's old crib out for the baby, so I will put her down -- yes, I will -- while you go upstairs and have a rest, all right? Sh sh sh sh.

JENNA: Honestly, a nap sounds awesome right now.

GRANDMA: Well, then, you just go right upstairs, Missy.

JENNA: Thank you.

GRANDMA: (Grandma goes upstairs and puts Amara to sleep in her own room.) Aww. Who's the little angel, hmm? You have to go to sleep. Oh, who's a beautiful baby? You are a beautiful, beautiful baby. There we go. Yeah. Night-night, doodlebug.

SAM: Okay, "Bite Me," how long have you been infected?

RABID MAN: Could ask you the same thing. We smell our own.

SAM: Answer the question.

RABID MAN: Why? 'Cause you want to know how much time you got left?

SAM: I want to know everything.

RABID MAN: Uh-huh. What's in it for me?

SAM: Well, if I can find a cure --

RABID MAN: "If." I want something real . . . something I can hold in my hands.

SAM: Like what?

RABID MAN: Your pudding. (Sam throws him the pudding cup, which he opens and eats with his fingers)

SAM: I was infected last night. You?

RABID MAN: This morning.

SAM: Wait a second. Then why --

RABID MAN: . . . am I further along? Don't know. This thing, it ain't math. I seen some people change fast, some change slow. But in the end . . . We all end up the same. We go psycho. And then we go boom.

SAM: Well, that's not -- I'm gonna fix this.

RABID MAN: LIAR! You and me, we're dead. We're just taking our sweet time about it. So if you were smart, you'd put a bullet in me . . . and then eat one yourself.

GRANDMA: Mary, mother -- no, Jenna, don't! Jenna, no! The devil's in that girl!

SAM: Wow. Vivid. Thanks.

DEAN: Look, man, I know you're flying solo.

SAM: No, I'm -- I'm fine, Dean. Look, don't -- don't worry about me. Just help Jenna. And if you need anything, then call me.

CASTIEL: Mercy, brother, please!

EFRAM: Brother? Ha! What are you?

CASTIEL: W-what? I'm an angel of the Lord.

EFRAM: That so? 'Cause, near as I can tell, when you have to choose between heaven and the Winchesters . . .

JONAH: You choose them.

EFRAM: Every time. So, see, you're not my brother. And if I had it my way, I'd take this blade, stick it in your heart . . . and call that a damn good day.

CASTIEL: Then do it!

EFRAM: Nah. The fun's just getting started.

CASTIEL: No!

Int. Hospital in Superior. Sam searches online for his cure, when he hears singing echoing through the hallways. He goes in search of the singer.

BILLIE: O death, o death, o death won't you spare me over another year? Oh, what is this that I can't see with ice-cold hands taking hold of me? When God is gone and the devil takes hold who'll have mercy on your soul?”

BILLIE: Hey, Sam.

SAM: How do you know my name? Who are you?

BILLIE: Mm. Think you mean "what?" Here's a hint. You and your brother been real good for business lately.

SAM: You're a Reaper.

BILLIE: The circle gets the square.

SAM: What's your name?

BILLIE: Mm, you flirtin' with me, kid? ‘Cause, no offense, but you ain't my type. And I'm not looking to get friendly with the man who helped gut my boss.

SAM: I'm sorry about Death.

BILLIE: So am I. But people are still dying, so . . . work to do, souls to collect . . . Messages to deliver.

SAM: What kind of messages?

BILLIE: It's over.

SAM: What's over?

BILLIE: You and Dean . . . Dying and coming back again and again. The old death thought it was funny. But now there's one hard, fast rule in this universe. What lives . . . dies. So the next time you or your brother bite it, well, you're not going to Heaven . . . Or Hell. One of us -- and, Lord, I hope it's me -- we're gonna make a mistake and toss you out into the Empty. And nothing comes back from that. I know you're dying. I can feel it. You're unclean in the biblical sense. So I'll be seeing you again, Sam . . . Seeing you real soon. Name's Billie, by the way.

Int. dungeon room where Efram and Jonah are torturing Castiel.

CASTIEL: I don't know.

JONAH: But you broke him out of heaven.

CASTIEL: Yes.

JONAH: And took his Grace.

CASTIEL: Yes.

EFRAM: And you expect us to believe he, what, just gave you the slip -- no powers, no wings?

CASTIEL: Metatron tricked me.

EFRAM: So you're just stupid.

JONAH: Or he's lying.

EFRAM: Or that.

JONAH: One way to find out.

EFRAM: What should we cut off first? Eeny? Meeny? Miny? Or Moe?

(Hannah bursts in the door)

HANNAH: That's enough.

CASTIEL: Hannah.

HANNAH: What are you doing?

EFRAM: Getting answers.

HANNAH: No. This isn't how we do things. Get out. Out!

(Efram and Jonah leave.)

CASTIEL: Thank you.

HANNAH: Don't thank me yet. Something's happened, Castiel -- something horrible.

Int. hospital in Superior. Sam walks by his computer and notices that his veins are getting worse. He goes to the chapel.

SAM: So . . . I know it's been a long time, but . . . Dean and I, we've -- we've been through a lot of bad. But this is different. This is my fault, and I don't know how to fix it. And if I have to die, I've made my peace with that, but . . . Please. Dean deserves better. Dean deserves a life. There are people out there, good people, who are going to suffer because of me, and I am not asking you to clean up my mess. Hell, I don't even know if you're out there, but . . . If you are . . . And if you can hear me, I, um . . . We need your help, God. We need to know there's hope. We need a sign.

DEAN: Really?

JENNA: Yeah.

(Jenna and Dean enter the house to find the “priest” Crowley drinking tea.)

CROWLEY: Hello, my son.

DEAN: Crowley.

CROWLEY: “Father” Crowley.

JENNA: Do you know each other?

CROWLEY: Oh, yes. Dean was a rather scrumptious young altar boy.

DEAN: Can I talk to you outside . . . Father?

CROWLEY: Of course. After I finish my tea.

Int. the dungeon room where Castiel is. Hannah takes him down and goes to uncuff him.

CASTIEL: No. This is safer. I wasn't lying about Metatron.

HANNAH: I know. But right now, I'm more worried about you.

CASTIEL: Can you heal me?

HANNAH: I can't. I'm sorry. This -- it's . . . powerful magic.

Ext. Jenna’s grandmother’s house. Dean and Crowley talk frankly.

DEAN: Really? Father Crowley? Really?

CROWLEY: I'm sorry, aging, pathetic, has-been rock star. Did I offend your delicate sensibilities? Where have you been? Your brother and that idiot angel, do you know what they've been doing?

DEAN: I've heard.

CROWLEY: Everything?

DEAN: Enough. What are you doing here?

CROWLEY: Same as you -- I'm working the case.

Int. dungeon. Hannah and Castiel continue their conversation.

CASTIEL: I feel the spell just cutting deeper and deeper, and I'm trying to fight it. I'm trying, but --

HANNAH: Does it have anything to do with the disturbance in Superior, Nebraska?

CASTIEL: You know about that?

HANNAH: Alarms have been sounding in heaven, Castiel -- alarms that haven't gone off in . . . ever. We don't even know what they mean.

CASTIEL: Those alarms are for the Darkness.

(the following dialogue is laid over a scene of Jenna sneaking into Amara’s room to try and comfort her crying.)

HANNAH: The Darkness is a story.

CASTIEL: No, it's not. It's real. The Darkness . . . It's been locked away since the dawn of creation. And now it's free.

JENNA: Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it.

HANNAH: God help us.

CASTIEL: I wouldn't count on that.

JENNA: Yeah, it's okay.

(the scene settles on Hannah and Castiel.)

HANNAH: Where is it?

CASTIEL: I don't know.

HANNAH: Then who would? The Winchesters? Castiel, if this is true, it's the end for all of us. Sam and Dean -- where are they?

CASTIEL: I don't know.

HANNAH: Then think harder!

CASTIEL: How did you find me?

Ext. Jenna’s grandmother’s house. Dean and Crowley are still talking.

CROWLEY: I have sources in the Catholic church -- nuns that owe me a favor, priests with a taste for --

DEAN: Okay, all right, yeah, I can imagine.

CROWLEY: You really can't. Anyhow, they hear of a demonic possession, they call me. If it's one of mine, I tell them to ignore it. If it's a, uh, demon gone rogue, well, that's when Father Crowley comes out to play.

DEAN: So you think there's a demon in there.

CROWLEY: Not even a little bit.

Int. Jenna’s grandmother’s house. Grandma puts the kettle on downstairs. Jenna leans over Amara’s crib. Jenna’s grandmother hears a thump upstairs and clutches her crucifix necklace.

Int. dungeon where Hannah and Castiel are talking.

HANNAH: I saved you.

CASTIEL: No. I don't think you did. I think that you told Efram and Jonah to bring me here and to hurt me, and so you arranged to -- to . . . to burst in and save me. You were hoping that I would be so grateful that I would do anything you said, that I would tell you anything that you wanted to know. Why, Hannah? We were friends.

HANNAH: That was before you freed Metatron . . . Before . . . The other angels, they hate you.

CASTIEL: And what about you? Do you hate me?

EFRAM: (both Efram and Jonah enter the room again) It doesn't matter. We took a vote -- democracy in action -- and . . . Hannah's doing the job.

CASTIEL: I won't give you Sam and Dean.

EFRAM: Sure you will.

JONAH: We're gonna hack your brain.

Ext. to Int. Jenna’s grandmother’s house. Crowley and Dean are still outside. Jenna comes into her grandmother’s kitchen.

CROWLEY: Whatever's in that house, I can taste the power radiating from it.

GRANDMA: Oh, Jenna! Oh! You scared me.

CROWLEY: That thing . . . It's old . . .

GRANDMA: What'd you do, drop a bowling ball up there?

CROWLEY: . . . deep . . .

GRANDMA: Jenna?

CROWLEY: . . . dark.

GRANDMA: Honey, are you all right?

JENNA: I always wanted to try this.

GRANDMA: *screams*

DEAN: Jenna? Jenna!

CROWLEY: Well, hello, plot twist.

Int. dungeon where Efram and Jonah have tied up Hannah and resumed torturing Castiel, this time with the helmet used to torture Samandriel. Castiel is screaming while they push long pokers into his head.

EFRAM: Anything?

JONAH: Not yet.

EFRAM: You said you knew how to do this.

JONAH: I watched Naomi . . . Once.

HANNAH: Enough!

EFRAM: Look, you don't want to get your pretty hands dirty, fine. Walk away. But this is happening. Gimme. Now hold still. This one might hurt.

HANNAH: I said stop.

EFRAM: You get in my way again . . . You touch me again, and I . . .

(Castiel is starting to grunt with effort and tremble.)

EFRAM: . . . will . . . end you!

JONAH: (noticing the pegs in Castiel’s head starting to fall out) Uh, Efram.

HANNAH: Castiel.

CASTIEL: No!

EFRAM: Aah!

CASTIEL: No! No!

BILLIE: You're unclean in the biblical sense.

SAM: Don't!

DEAN: Listen, Velma, this isn't the Scooby gang, okay? So either shut up or get out.

CROWLEY: Easy, tiger. Just trying to help. (Amara starts crying from the other room and Dean walks away.) I'm way more of a Daphne.

DEAN: Why did you do that?

CROWLEY: Because this woman doesn't have a soul. Fascinating.

DEAN: What are you talking about? How is that even possible?

JENNA: Amara's hungry. She's a growing girl.

DEAN: Jenna. Listen to me. Whatever's happened, whatever's going on, we can fix it, okay?

JENNA: But I don't want to be fixed. I like the new me. She's a ball.

DEAN: Just come with us, okay? Jenna! Stop!

CROWLEY: I was getting bored.

DEAN: You killed her!

CROWLEY: You're welcome.

DEAN: Where are you going?

CROWLEY: To see the child that eats souls.

DEAN: You don't get what that thing is.

CROWLEY: Enlighten me. Come on, darling. Don't play coy.

DEAN: I think Amara is the Darkness.

CROWLEY: Interesting. So, what now? You kill her? You?

DEAN: I don't have a choice.

CROWLEY: Please. Even if you could murder a baby, you couldn't murder that baby. I saw the way you looked at her. Me, on the other hand, it's not like it'd be my first.

DEAN: Oh, is that an offer? It's a promise -- right after I'm done with her.

DEAN: Stay away from her!

CROWLEY: Oh, Dean. Adorable little Dean. I want that child, and I get what I want. You and Sam don't understand. I'm not your bloody sidekick! We've had some good times.

Int. bunker, library. Sam and Dean arrive home to find the giant mess from the Styne family and Castiel.

SAM: All right, I still don't understand. I mean, I thought the darkness was a woman, not a child.

SAM: Vision?

DEAN: Yeah.
