TEASER
Subtitle
Red Lodge, Montana

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

A young woman is running through a dark forest. Creepy music. She trips and falls. She stops behind a tree and her pursuer runs past. Relaxing, thinking she's safe, she steps out. A large hook appears, slices her head off.

ACT ONE
EXT. ROAD- DAY

Soundtrack: AC/DC "Back In Black"

The Metallicar zooms up a 2-lane, driven by Dean. He is in a good mood, grooving along to his music. Several gratuitous shots of the shininess of the Impala.

DEAN
Whoo! Listen to her purr! Have you ever heard anything so sweet?

SAM
You know, if you two wanna get a room, just let me know, Dean.

DEAN
Oh, don't listen to him, baby. He doesn't understand us.

SAM (laughs)
You're in a good mood.

DEAN
Why shouldn't I be?

SAM
No reason.

DEAN
Got my car, got a case, things are looking up.

SAM
Wow. Give you a couple of severed heads and a pile of dead cows and you're Mister Sunshine.

DEAN laughs.
How far to Red Lodge?

SAM
Uh, about another three hundred miles.

DEAN
Good.
(he floors it)



INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

In Red Lodge, a sheriff with an impressive mustache is talking to Sam and Dean, who are posing as reporters.

SHERIFF
The murder investigation is ongoing, and that's all I can share with the press at this time.

SAM
Sure, sure, we understand that, but just for the record, you found the first, uh, head last week, correct?

SHERIFF
Mm-hmm.

SAM
Okay, and the other, a uh, Christina Flanigan,

SHERIFF
That was two days ago. Is there --
(A young woman knocks on the door, points at her watch.)
Oh. Sorry boys, time's up, we're done here.

SAM
One last question --

DEAN
Yeah, what about the cattle?

SHERIFF
Excuse me?

DEAN
You know, the cows found dead, split open, drained ... over a dozen cases.

SHERIFF
What about them?

SAM
So you don't think there's a connection?

SHERIFF
Connection ... with...?

SAM
First cattle mutilations, now two murders? Kinda sounds like ritual stuff.

DEAN
You know, like satanic cult ritual stuff?

SHERIFF
(laughs)
You - you're not kidding.

DEAN
No.

SHERIFF
Those cows aren't being mutilated. You wanna know how I know?

SAM
How?

SHERIFF
Because there's no such thing as cattle mutilation. Cow drops, leave it in the sun, within forty eight hours the bloat'll split it open so clean it's just about surgical. The bodily fluids fall down into the ground and get soaked up because that's what gravity does. But, hey, it could be Satan. What newspaper did you say you work for?

DEAN
World Weekly News...

SAM
Weekly World News.

DEAN
World -

SAM
Weekly World -

DEAN
Weekly... I'm new.

SHERIFF
Get out of my office.


INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Dean and Sam enter the morgue, still wearing their shirts and ties from the previous scene but now also in white lab coats. The intern on duty has a name tag that reads "J. Manners." Dean looks at it, calculating.

DEAN
John.

JEFF
Jeff.

DEAN
Jeff. I know that. Dr. Dworkin needs to see you in his office right away.

JEFF
But Dr. Dworkin's on vacation.

DEAN
Well, he's back. And he's pissed, and he's screaming for you, man, so if I were you I would... (Dean whistles)
(intern runs away)
Okay.
Hey, those satanists in Florida, they marked their victims, didn't they?

SAM
Yeah, reversed pentacle on the forehead.

DEAN
Yeah. So much f'd up crap happens in Florida.

DEAN hands SAM a pair of latex gloves and puts on a pair of his own; SAM opens a compartment and wheels out a corpse; there's a box between its legs.

DEAN
All right, open it.

SAM
You open it.

DEAN
Wuss.

DEAN carries the box over to another table and flips off the lid, grimacing. SAM approaches, cringing.

DEAN
Well, no pentagram.

SAM
Wow. Poor girl.

DEAN
Maybe we should, uh, you know, look in her mouth, see if those wackos stuffed anything down her throat. You know, kinda like the moth in Silence of the Lambs.

SAM
Yeah, here, go ahead.

DEAN
No, you go ahead.

SAM
What?

DEAN
"Put the lotion in the basket." (quoting from Silence of the Lambs)

SAM
Right, yeah, I'm the wuss, huh? Whatever.
(SAM steels himself and starts poking his fingers into the mouth.)
Dean, get me a bucket?

DEAN
You find something?

SAM
No, I'm going to puke.

DEAN
Wait, lift the lip up again?

SAM
What? You want me to throw up, is that it?

DEAN
No, no, no, I think I saw something.
(He pulls back the lip)
What is that, a hole?

DEAN presses on the gum and a narrow, sharp tooth descends.

SAM
It's a tooth.

DEAN
Sam, that's a fang. Retractable set of vampire fangs. You gotta be kidding me.

SAM
Well, this changes things.

DEAN
Ya think?



EXT. BAR - NIGHT
DEAN and SAM pull up near a local bar, go around to park. They go into:



INT. BAR - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM approach the bar; a man (GORDON) sitting at a table to one side is watching them.

DEAN
How's it going?

BARTENDER
Living the dream. What can I get for you?

DEAN
Two beers, please.

SAM
So, we're looking for some people.

BARTENDER
Sure. Hard to be lonely.

SAM
Yeah. But um, that's not what I meant.
(He pulls out a $50 bill, fingering it, and drops it on the bar; bartender looks at it, then takes it)
Right. So these, these people, they would have moved here about six months ago, probably pretty rowdy, like to drink...

DEAN
Yeah, real night owls, you know? Sleep all day, party all night.

BARTENDER
Barker farm got leased out a couple months ago. Real winners. They've been in here a lot - drinkers. Noisy. I've had to 86 them once or twice.

DEAN
Thanks.

They leave their half-finished beers on the table and leave. The man who was watching them is gone, a smoldering cigarette left behind. As DEAN and SAM leave, the man watches, then stalks them. They go down an alley, he follows. He loses sight of them, turns. DEAN and SAM are suddenly there, pinning him to the wall, DEAN with a knife at his throat.

DEAN
Smile.

GORDON
What?

DEAN
Show us those pearly whites.

GORDON
Oh, for the love of -- you want to stick that thing someplace else? I'm not a vampire.
(SAM frowns)
Yeah, that's right. I heard you guys in there.

SAM
What do you know about vampires?

GORDON
How to kill them. Now seriously, bro. That knife's making me itch.
(DEAN cocks his head. The man starts to pull away, SAM pins him harder.)
Whoa. Easy there, Chachi.
(He slowly brings his right hand to his lip, pulls it back, revealing normal gums.)
See? Fangless. Happy?
(DEAN lets up)
Now. Who the hell are you?



EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

At the man's car, he pulls out his arsenal, which includes the large hook from the teaser scene.

GORDON
Sam and Dean Winchester. I can't believe it. You know I met your old man once? Hell of a guy. Great hunter. I heard he passed. I'm sorry. It's big shoes. But from what I hear you guys fill 'em. Great trackers, good in a tight spot --

DEAN
You seem to know a lot about our family.

GORDON
Word travels fast. You know how hunters talk.

DEAN
No, we don't, actually.

GORDON
I guess there's a lot your dad never told you, huh?

SAM
So, um, so those two vampires, they were yours, huh?

GORDON
Yep. Been here two weeks.

DEAN
Did you check out that Barker farm?

GORDON
It's a bust. Just a bunch of hippie freaks. Though they could kill you with that patchouli smell alone.

DEAN
Where's the nest, then?

GORDON
I got this one covered. Look, don't get me wrong. It's a real pleasure meetin' you fellas. But I've been on this thing over a year. I killed a fang back in Austin, tracked the nest all the way up here. I'll finish it.

DEAN
We could help.

GORDON
Thanks, but uh, I'm kind of a go-it-alone type of guy.

DEAN
Come on, man, I"ve been itching for a hunt.

GORDON
Sorry. But hey, I hear there's a Chupacabra two states over. You go ahead and knock yourselves out.
(He gets in his car.)
It was real good meeting you, though. I'll buy you a drink on the flip side.
(He drives off)



INT. MILL - NIGHT

A man is sitting in the quiet mill, alone. He hears a noise, starts investigating. He goes up to the roof, pulls out a crowbar. A crow flies at his head, startling him. He relaxes, then turns around to find...

GORDON attacking him with a machete. The man extends his fangs. They struggle near an electric saw; the vampire turns it on, pinning Gordon down below it, nearly decapitating him until...

SAM pulls him to safety; DEAN attacks the vampire, getting him pinned under the electric saw. He lowers the saw, decapitating him. Dean is sprayed with blood.

GORDON
So uh, I guess I gotta buy you that drink.

SAM stares at DEAN, stunned.


END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
INT. BAR - NIGHT

GORDON, DEAN, and SAM are sitting around a table in the bar. A waitress brings them another round, DEAN reaches for his wallet.

GORDON
No, no, I got it.

DEAN
Come on.

GORDON
I insist.
(to the waitress)
Thank you, sweetie.
(raising his shot glass)
Another one bites the dust.

DEAN
That's right.

DEAN and GORDON drink a toast; SAM is sitting back, arms folded.

GORDON
Dean. (laughs) You gave that big-ass fang one hell of a haircut, my friend.

DEAN
Thank you.

GORDON
That was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.

DEAN
Yep. You all right, Sammy?

SAM
I'm fine.

GORDON
Well, lighten up a little, Sammy.

SAM
He's the only one who gets to call me that.

GORDON
Okay. No offense meant. Just celebrating a little. Job well done.

SAM
Right. Well, decapitations aren't my idea of a good time, I guess.

GORDON
Oh, come one, man, it's not like it was human. You've gotta have a little more fun with your job.

DEAN
See? That's what I've been trying to tell him. You could learn a thing or two from this guy.

SAM
Yeah I bet I could. Look, I'm not gonna bring you guys down. I'm just gonna go back to the motel.

DEAN
You sure?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Sammy? Remind me to beat that buzzkill out of you later, all right?
(He tosses Sam the keys.)

GORDON
Something I said?

DEAN
Nah, nah, he just gets that way sometimes. Tell you what. Match you quarters for the next round.

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

SAM returns to the motel room, drops the keys on a hook.



INT. BAR - NIGHT

DEAN
... So. I pick up this crossbow. And I hit that ugly sucker with a silver-tipped arrow right in his heart. Sammy's waiting in the car, and uh, me and my dad take the thing into the woods, burn it to a crisp. I'm sitting there and looking into the fire, and I'm thinking to myself, I'm sixteen years old. Most kids my age are worried about pimples, prom dates. I'm seeing things that they'll never even know. Never even dream of. So right then, I just sort of -

GORDON
Embraced the life?

DEAN
Yeah.

GORDON
Yeah.

DEAN
Yeah. How'd you get started?

GORDON
First time I saw a vampire I was barely eighteen. Home alone with my sister. I hear the window break in her room. I grab my dad's gun, run in, try to get it off her. Too late. So I shoot the damn thing. Which of course is about as useful as snapping it with a rubber band. It rushes me, picks me up, flings me across the room, knocks me out cold. When I wake up, the vampire's gone, my sister's gone.

DEAN
And then?

GORDON
Then... try explaining that one to your family. So I left home. And then bummed around looking for information: how you track 'em, how you kill 'em. And I found that fang - it was my first kill.

DEAN
Sorry about your sister.

GORDON
Yeah. She was beautiful. I can still see her, you know? The way she was. But hey, that was a long time ago. I mean, your dad. It's gotta be rough.

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, you know. He was just one of those guys. Took some terrible beatings, just kept coming. So you're always thinking to yourself, he's indestructible. He'll always be around, nothing can kill my dad. Then just like that (snaps) he's gone. I can't talk about this to Sammy. You know, I gotta keep my game face on. (clears throat) But, uh, the truth is I'm not handling it very well. Feel like I have this -

GORDON
Hole inside you? And it just gets bigger and bigger and darker and darker? Good. You can use it. Keeps you hungry. Trust me. There's plenty out there needs killing, and this'll help you do it. Dean, it's not a crime to need your job.



INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

The roadhouse is crowded, ELLEN is working behind the bar. She hears the phone ring and picks up.

ELLEN
Harvelle's Roadhouse.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

SAM
Hey, Ellen, uh, Sam Winchester.

ELLEN
Sam, it's good to hear from you. You boys are okay, aren't you?

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Got a question.

ELLEN
Yeah, shoot.

SAM
You ever run across a guy named Gordon Walker?

ELLEN
Yeah, I know Gordon.

SAM
And?

ELLEN
Well, he's a real good hunter. Why are you asking, sweetie?

SAM
Well, we ran into him on a job and we're kinda working with him, I guess.

ELLEN
Don't do that, Sam.

SAM
I - I thought you said he was a good hunter.

ELLEN
Yeah, and Hannibal Lecter's a good psychiatrist. Look, he is dangerous to everyone and everything around him. If he's working on a job you boys just let him handle it and you move on.

SAM
Ellen -

ELLEN
No, Sam? You -- just listen to what I'm telling you, okay?

SAM
Right, okay.



INT. BAR - NIGHT

GORDON
Know why I love this life?

DEAN
Hmm?

GORDON
It's all black and white. There's no maybe. You find the bad thing, kill it. See, most people spend their lives in shades of gray. Is this right? Is that wrong? Not us.

DEAN
Not sure Sammy would agree with you, but uh...

GORDON
Doesn't seem like your brother's much like us.
(DEAN stares at him, startled)
I'm not saying he's wrong. Just different. But you and me? We were born to do this. It's in our blood.
(Dean looks thoughtful)



EXT - MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

SAM buys a soda from a vending machine and starts walking back to the room. He pauses as if hearing something, cautiously opens the door, looking around. He gets inside and leans against the door, relieved. Suddenly a dark figure jumps him from behind. He knocks his first attacker down, then the second; the first attacker rises up behind him and slams a heavy telephone into the back of his head, knocking him out.

CUT TO BLACK

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT, EARLY SUNRISE

The truck crosses a bridge.

CUT TO BLACK

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

SAM is bound to a chair and gagged, a sack over his head; it's pulled off by the bartender from earlier. He shows a lot of fangs and advances on SAM, who struggles.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. NEST - NIGHT

As the vampire advances on SAM, a woman (LENORE) appears in the doorway.

LENORE
Wait! Step back, Eli.

ELI pulls back, his fangs retracting. The woman walks over and pulls off SAM'S gag.

LENORE
My name's Lenore. I'm not going to hurt you. We just need to talk.

SAM
Talk? Yeah, okay, but I might have a tough time paying attention to much besides Eli's teeth.

LENORE
He won't hurt you either. You have my word.

SAM
Your word? Oh yeah, great, thanks. Listen lady, no offense but you're not the first vampire I've met.

LENORE
We're not like the others. We don't kill humans, and we don't drink their blood. We haven't for a long time.

SAM
What is this, some kind of joke?

LENORE
Notice you're still alive.

SAM
Okay, uh, correct me if I'm wrong here, but shouldn't you be starving to death?

LENORE
We've found other ways. Cattle blood.

SAM
You're telling me you're responsible for all the --

LENORE
It's not ideal, in fact it's disgusting. But -- it allows us to get by.

SAM
Okay, uh, why?

LENORE
Survival. No deaths, no missing locals, no reason for people like you to come looking for people like us. We blend in. Our kind is practically extinct. Turns out we weren't quite as high up the food chain as we imagined.

ELI
Why are we explaining ourselves to this killer?

LENORE
Eli!

ELI
We choke on cow's blood so that none of them suffer. Tonight they murdered Conrad and they celebrated.

LENORE
Eli, that's enough.

SAM
Yeah, Eli, that's enough.

LENORE
What's done is done. We're leaving this town tonight.

SAM
Then why did you bring me here? Why are you even talking to me?

LENORE
Believe me, I'd rather not. But I know your kind. Once you have the scent you'll keep tracking us. It doesn't matter where we go. Hunters will find us.

SAM
So you're asking us not to follow you.

LENORE
We have a right to live. We're not hurting anyone.

SAM
Right, so you keep saying, but give me one good reason why I should believe you.

LENORE
Fine. (She gets in his face.) You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to let you go.
(He looks at her, startled.)
Take him back. Not a mark on him.

Two vampires lead SAM back to the truck, his head covered in the sack again. They drive off.



INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

DEAN and GORDON sit at the table, discussing strategy over a map.

GORDON
This is the best pattern I can establish. It's sketchy at best.

DEAN
Looks like it's all coming from this side of town. Which means the nest would be around here someplace, right?

GORDON
Yep, that's what I'm thinking. Problem is, there's thirty-five, forty farms out there. I've searched about half of them already, but nothing yet. They're covering their tracks real good.

DEAN
Well, I guess we'll just have to search the other half.
(DEAN looks at his watch)
What time is it? Where is Sam?

GORDON
Car's parked outside. Probably went for a walk. Seems like the take-a-walk type.

DEAN
Yeah, he is, but...

The door opens and SAM enters. He gives DEAN a look.

DEAN
Where you been?

SAM
Can I talk to you alone?

DEAN
(to GORDON)
You mind chillin' out for a couple minutes?



EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN exit the motel room and walk into the parking lot during the following.

SAM
Dean, maybe we've got to rethink this hunt.

DEAN
What are you talking about? Where were you?

SAM
In the nest.

DEAN
You found it?

SAM
They found me, man.

DEAN
How'd you get out? How many'd you kill?

SAM
None.

DEAN
Well Sam, they didn't just let you go.

SAM
That's exactly what they did.

DEAN
All right, well, where is it?

SAM
I was blindfolded, I don't know.

DEAN
Well, you've got to know something.

SAM
We went over that bridge outside of town, but Dean, listen. Maybe we shouldn't go after them.

DEAN
Why not?

SAM
I don't think they're like other vampires. I don't think they're killing people.

DEAN
You're joking. Then how do they stay alive? Or undead, or whatever the hell they are.

SAM
The cattle mutilations. They said they live off of animal blood.

DEAN
And you believed them?

SAM
Look at me, Dean. They let me go without a scratch.

DEAN
Wait, so you're saying... No, man, no way. I don't know why they let you go. I don't really care. We find 'em, we waste 'em.

SAM
Why?

DEAN
What part of 'vampires' don't you understand, Sam? If it's supernatural, we kill it, end of story. That's our job.

SAM
No, Dean, that is not our job. Our job is hunting evil. And if these things aren't killing people, they're not evil!

DEAN
Of course they're killing people, that's what they do. They're all the same, Sam. They're not human, okay? We have to exterminate every last one of them.

SAM
No, Dean, I don't think so, all right? Not this time.

DEAN
Gordon's been on those vamps for a year, man, he knows.

SAM
Gordon?

DEAN
Yes.

SAM
You're taking his word for it?

DEAN
That's right.

SAM
Ellen says he's bad news.

DEAN
You called Ellen?
(SAM nods)
And I'm supposed to listen to her? We barely know her, Sam, no thanks, I'll go with Gordon.
SAM
Right, 'cause Gordon's such an old friend. You don't think I can see what this is?

DEAN
What are you talking about?

SAM
He's a substitute for Dad, isn't he? A poor one.

DEAN
Shut up, Sam.

SAM
He's not even close, Dean. Not on his best day.

DEAN
You know what? I'm not even going to talk about this.

SAM
You know, you slap on this big fake smile but I can see right through it. Because I know how you feel, Dean. Dad's dead. And he left a hole, and it hurts so bad you can't take it, but you can't just fill up that hole with whoever you want to. It's an insult to his memory.

DEAN
Okay.

He starts to turn away, then punches SAM, hard. SAM pauses, turning back slowly, but not rising to the bait.

SAM
You hit me all you want. It won't change anything.

DEAN
I'm going to that nest. You don't want to tell me where it is, fine. I'll find it myself.

SAM
Dean?



INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN returns to the motel room, SAM following; GORDON is gone.

DEAN
Gordon?

SAM
You think he went after them?

DEAN
Probably.

SAM
Dean, we have to stop him.

DEAN
Really, Sam? Because I say we lend a hand.

SAM
Just give me the benefit of the doubt, would you? You owe me that.

DEAN
Yeah, we'll see. I'll drive. Give me the keys.

SAM points to the table where he'd set them earlier; they're gone.

SAM
He snaked the keys.



INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

DEAN is hotwiring his car and grimacing.

DEAN
I can't believe this. I just fixed her up, too.
(The car starts)
So the bridge, is that, uh, is that all you got?

SAM
The bridge was four and a half minutes from their farm.

DEAN
How do you know?

SAM
I counted.
(He starts tracing a path on the map in his lap.)
They took a left out of the farm, then turned right onto a dirt road, followed that for two minutes slightly up a hill, then took another quick right and we hit the bridge.

DEAN
You're good. You're a monster pain in the ass, but you're good.



INT. NEST - NIGHT

LENORE is packing things into boxes; ELI comes in and sets a box on the table.

LENORE
In the truck, thank you.

ELI
We can't leave like this. Lenore. Listen to me, we need to stay and fight.

LENORE
They were my friends too, Eli, my family.

ELI
That's not what I'm talking about. This is self-defense. Kill or be killed. They can't hunt us if they're dead.

LENORE
Killing those three wouldn't solve anything. There's more where they came from. We're out-numbered. This. This is all we can do. Try and reason --

ELI
You can't reason with these people. They're going to kill us all anyway. We should at least take a few of them with us.

LENORE
I'm not giving up hope. If we can change, they can change. Now go into town and gather the others. We leave before sunrise.



EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

Gordon's red car crosses the bridge and turns up a small road.

Some ways behind, SAM and DEAN are in the Impala. SAM sighs, staring at the map. DEAN glances at him, then looks back to the road. SAM frowns at DEAN.


EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

LENORE comes out of the house with a box, sets it on the flatbed of a truck. She turns and GORDON is there. He grabs her, raises a knife that glistens with blood. He stabs it into her chest; she goes limp.

GORDON
Dead man's blood, bitch.



END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Gordon dips the knife into a jar of blood. LENORE is tied to a chair nearby, covered in cuts, pale and sickly. He circles around her, slices the bloody knife across her chest. She groans. SAM and DEAN arrive.

GORDON
Sam, Dean. Come on in.

DEAN
Hey, Gordon. What's going on?

GORDON
Just poisoning Lenore here with some dead man's blood. She's going to tell us where all her little friends are, aren't you? Wanna help?

DEAN
Look, man --

GORDON
Grab a knife. I was just about to start in on the fingers.

He drags the knife across her arm; veins trace away from the cut.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, let's all just chill out, huh?

GORDON
I'm completely chill.

SAM
Gordon, put the knife down.

SAM steps towards GORDON, DEAN stops him with a hand on his chest.

GORDON
Sounds like it's Sam here needs to chill.

SAM
Just step away from her, all right?

GORDON
You're right. I'm wasting my time here. This bitch will never talk. Might as well put her out of her misery.
(He pulls out a larger knife)
I just sharpened it, so it's completely humane.

He turns towards LENORE; SAM steps to block him.

SAM
Gordon, I'm letting her go.

GORDON points the knife at SAM'S chest, stopping him.

GORDON
You're not doing a damn thing.

DEAN
Hey, hey, hey, Gordon, let's talk about this.

GORDON
What's there to talk about? It's like I said, Dean. No shades of gray.

DEAN
Yeah. I hear ya. And I know how you feel.

GORDON
Do you?

DEAN
That vampire that killed your sister deserved to die, but this one...

GORDON
(laughing)
Killed my sister? That filthy fang didn't kill my sister. It turned her. It made her one of them. So I hunted her down, and I killed her myself.

DEAN
You did what?

GORDON
It wasn't my sister anymore, it wasn't human. I didn't blink. And neither would you.

SAM
So you knew all along, then? You knew about the vampires, you knew they weren't killing anyone. You knew about the cattle. And you just didn't care.

GORDON
Care about what? A nest of vampires suddenly acting nice? Taking a little time out from sucking innocent people? And we're supposed to buy that? Trust me. Doesn't change what they are. And I can prove it.

He grabs SAM'S arm, slices the knife across it, then lays the knife against his throat, dragging him towards LENORE. DEAN pulls his gun.

DEAN
Let him go. Now!

GORDON
Relax. If I wanted to kill him he'd already be on the floor. Just making a little point.

GORDON holds the cut on SAM's arm over LENORE, so the blood drips on her face. She hisses, fangs extending.

DEAN
Hey!

GORDON
You think she's so different? Still want to save her? Look at her. They're all the same. Evil, bloodthirsty.

LENORE controls herself, retracting her fangs, and turns her face away.

LENORE
No. No.

SAM
You hear her, Gordon?

LENORE
No! No!

SAM pushes the knife away from his throat, and pushes GORDON away.

SAM
We're done here.

DEAN
Sam, get her out of here.

SAM
Yeah.

SAM picks LENORE up in his arms; GORDON takes a step towards him, but DEAN still has the gun trained on him.

DEAN
Uh-uh. Uh-uh! (warning Gordon from interfering with SAM.) Gordon, I think you and I've got some things to talk about.

GORDON
Get out of my way.

DEAN
Sorry.

GORDON
You're not serious.

DEAN
I'm having a hard time believing it too, but I know what I saw. If you want those vampires, you gotta go through me.

GORDON nods, considering. He looks at his knife, then jams it into the table.

GORDON
Fine.

DEAN looks at the knife, looks at his gun. He pulls the clip out of the gun and sets it aside. GORDON punches him; they start fighting. GORDON grabs the knife again; DEAN groans. They are fairly well matched.

GORDON
What are you doing, man? You doing this for a fang? Come on, Dean, we're on the same side here.

DEAN
I don't think so, you sadistic bastard.

GORDON throws DEAN across the room.

GORDON
You're not like your brother. You're a killer. Like me.

DEAN kicks GORDON down, hauls him up against the wall, and elbows him in the face, knocking him out. Pinning him under his elbow, he slams GORDON'S head into another wall.
Oh, sorry.
DEAN sets him in a chair and ties him up.

DEAN
You know, I might be like you, and I might not. But you're the one tied up right now.



END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

SAM returns to find GORDON tied to the chair, DEAN pacing. Gordon and Dean watch each other.

SAM
Did I miss anything?

DEAN
Nah, not much. Lenore get out okay?

SAM
Yeah. All of 'em did.

DEAN
Then I guess our work here is done. How you doin', Gordy? Gotta tinkle yet? (Gordon looks at him.) All right. Well, get comfy. We'll call someone in two or three days, have them come out, untie you.

He jams GORDON'S knife into a table behind him.

SAM
Ready to go, Dean?

DEAN
Not yet. I guess this is goodbye. Well, it's been real.
(He hits GORDON, knocking him in his chair to the floor. Sam clears his throat.)
Okay. I'm good now. We can go.



EXT. FARM - DAY

As they exit the farmhouse, both wince at their recent injuries - SAM's left arm is wrapped in a bandage. DEAN stops, setting himself on his feet like a boxer.

DEAN
Sam? Clock me one.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Come on. I won't even hit you back. Let's go.

SAM
No.

DEAN
Let's go, you get a freebie. Hit me, come on.

SAM
You look like you just went twelve rounds with a block of cement, Dean. I'll take a raincheck.

DEAN
I wish we never took this job. It's jacked everything up.

SAM
What do you mean?

DEAN
Think about all the hunts we went on, Sammy, our whole lives.

SAM
Okay.

DEAN
What if we killed things that didn't deserve killing? You know? I mean, the way Dad raised us...

SAM
Dean, after what happened to Mom, Dad did the best he could.

DEAN
I know he did. But the man wasn't perfect. And the way he raised us, to hate those things; and man, I hate 'em. I do. When I killed that vampire at the mill I didn't even think about it; hell, I even enjoyed it.

SAM
You didn't kill Lenore.

DEAN
No, but every instinct told me to. I was gonna kill her. I was gonna kill 'em all.

SAM
Yeah, Dean, but you didn't. And that's what matters.

DEAN
Yeah. Well, 'cause you're a pain in my ass.

SAM
Guess I might have to stick around to be a pain in the ass, then.

DEAN
Thanks.

SAM
Don't mention it.

SAM gets in the passenger's side; DEAN stares off into the distance for a moment before climbing in and driving away.
