TEASER


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Car alarms blare. Several cars in various states of smashed to pieces are in the street. CASTIEL appears and silences the alarms. He walks through the wreckage to the body of a woman. He moves part of her clothing off her neck; she has been stabbed to death.

CASTIEL
Goodbye, sister.

Police cars arrive. Officers rush into the scene.

OFFICER
What the hell?

An aerial view of the woman's corpse. A spotlight from a helicopter illuminates the ground on either side, where the image of wings has been seared into the asphalt.

ACT ONE


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

SAM is driving.

SAM
Ruby will meet us outside Cheyenne. She's been tracking some leads. I know she's not exactly on your Christmas list, but if she can help us get to Lilith—

DEAN
Hey, man, work with Ruby, don't. I don't really give a rat's ass.

SAM
What's your problem?

DEAN
Pamela didn't want anything to do with this and we dragged her back into it, Sam.

SAM
She knew what was at stake.

DEAN
Oh yeah. Saving the world. And we're doing such a damn good job of it.

SAM
Dean—

DEAN
I'm tired of burying friends, Sam.

SAM
Look, we catch a fresh trail—

DEAN
And we follow it, I know. Like I said, I'm just—I'm just getting tired.

SAM
Well, get angry.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

They enter the room.

DEAN
Ah, home crappy home.

SAM flips on the lights.

URIEL
Winchester and Winchester.

URIEL and CASTIEL are waiting inside the room.

DEAN
Oh come on.

URIEL
You are needed.

DEAN
Needed? We just got back from needed.

URIEL
Now, you mind your tone with me.

DEAN
No, you mind your damn tone with us.

SAM
We just got back from Pamela's funeral.

DEAN
Pamela. You know, psychic Pamela? You remember her. Cas, you remember her. You burned her eyes out. Remember that? Good times. Yeah, then she died saving one of your precious seals. So maybe you can stop pushing us around like chess pieces for five freaking minutes!

URIEL
We raised you out of hell for our purposes.

DEAN
Yeah, what were those again? What exactly did you want from me?

URIEL
Start with gratitude.

DEAN
Oh.

CASTIEL
Dean, we know this is difficult to understand.

URIEL
And we—

URIEL gives CASTIEL a significant look.

URIEL
—don't care. Now, seven angels have been murdered, all of them from our garrison. The last one was killed tonight.

DEAN
Demons? How they doing it?

URIEL
We don't know.

SAM
I'm sorry, but what do you want us to do about it? I mean, a demon with the juice to ice angels has to be out of our league, right?

URIEL
We can handle the demons, thank you very much.

CASTIEL
Once we find whoever it is.

DEAN
So you need our help hunting a demon?

CASTIEL
Not quite. We have Alastair.

DEAN
Great. He should be able to name your trigger man.

CASTIEL
But he won't talk. Alastair's will is very strong. We've arrived at an impasse.

DEAN
Yeah, well, he's like a black belt in torture. I mean, you guys are out of your league.

URIEL
That's why we've come to his student. You happen to be the most qualified interrogator we've got.

DEAN looks down.

CASTIEL
Dean, you are our best hope.

DEAN
No. No way. You can't ask me to do this, Cas. Not this.

URIEL walks up to DEAN.

URIEL
Who said anything about asking?

SAM looks around. The room is empty.

SAM
Damn it!

INT. BUILDING - NIGHT

ALASTAIR is visible through a window in a door, chained to a hexacle standing in the middle of a devil's trap.

CASTIEL
This devil's trap is old Enochian. He's bound completely.

DEAN
Fascinating.

DEAN turns away from the door.

DEAN
Where's the door?

CASTIEL
Where are you going?

DEAN
Hitch back to Cheyenne, thank you very much.

DEAN walks past URIEL, then stops: URIEL is blocking his path.

URIEL
Angels are dying, boy.

DEAN
Everybody's dying these days. And hey, I get it. You're all-powerful. You can make me do whatever you want. But you can't make me do this.

CASTIEL
This is too much to ask, I know. But we have to ask it.

DEAN watches CASTIEL for a moment, then turns back to URIEL.

DEAN
I want to talk to Cas alone.

URIEL
I think I'll go seek revelation. We might have some further orders.

DEAN
Well, get some donuts while you're out.

URIEL laughs.

URIEL
Ah, this one just won't quit, will he? I think I'm starting to like you, boy.

DEAN watches URIEL vanish.

DEAN
You guys don't walk enough. You're gonna get flabby.

CASTIEL doesn't react.

DEAN
You know, I'm starting to think junkless has a better sense of humor than you do.

CASTIEL
Uriel's the funniest angel in the garrison. Ask anyone.

DEAN walks up to CASTIEL.

DEAN
What's going on, Cas? Since when does Uriel put a leash on you?

CASTIEL
My superiors have begun to question my sympathies.

DEAN
Your sympathies?

CASTIEL
I was getting too close to the humans in my charge. You. They feel I've begun to express emotions. The doorways to doubt. This can impair my judgment.

DEAN
Well, tell Uriel, or whoever...you do not want me doing this, trust me.

CASTIEL
Want it, no. But I have been told we need it.

DEAN
You ask me to open that door and walk through it, you will not like what walks back out.

CASTIEL
For what it's worth, I would give anything not to have you do this.

DEAN closes his eyes.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN wheels a loaded cart covered with a cloth into the room where ALASTAIR is imprisoned. ALASTAIR watches DEAN enter, grins, and starts to sing, moving within the chains almost as though he is dancing.

ALASTAIR
Heaven, I'm in heaven, and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak. I seem to find the happiness I seek, when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek...

DEAN pulls the cloth off the cart, revealing an assortment of torture implements. ALASTAIR laughs. DEAN ignores him.

ALASTAIR
I'm sorry. This is a very serious, very emotional situation for you. I shouldn't laugh, it's just that—I mean, are they serious? They sent you to torture me?

DEAN
You got one chance. One. Tell me who's killing the angels. I want a name.

ALASTAIR
You think I'll see all your scary toys and spill my guts?

DEAN
Oh, you'll spill your guts, one way or another. I just didn't wanna ruin my shoes.

ALASTAIR
Oh, yeah.

DEAN
Now answer the question.

ALASTAIR
Or what? You'll work me over? But then, maybe you don't want to. Maybe you're, ah, scared to.

DEAN
I'm here, aren't I?

ALASTAIR
Not entirely. You left part of yourself back in the Pit. Let's see if we can get the two of you back together again, shall we?

DEAN
You're gonna be disappointed.

DEAN walks over to the cart.

ALASTAIR
You have not disappointed me so far. Come on. You gotta want a little payback for everything I did to you. For all the pokes and prods. Hm?

DEAN is impassive.

ALASTAIR
No? Um...how about for all the things I did to your daddy?

DEAN's head comes up.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

SAM opens the door for RUBY.

RUBY
I can still smell them. Seriously, Sam, I'm not exactly dying to tangle with angels again.

SAM
I need you to find out where they took Dean.

RUBY
Not sure I see the problem. You know they have Alastair strung up six ways from Sunday. Dean cuts himself a slice, Al's reduced to a quivering heap, and the good guys get the goods. What's wrong with that?

SAM
He can't do it.

RUBY
Look, I get it. You don't want him going all torture master again.

SAM
No. I mean, he can't do it. He can't get the job done. Something happened to him downstairs, Ruby. He's not what he used to be. He's not strong enough.

RUBY
And you are?

SAM
I will be.

INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

ALASTAIR
I had your pop on my rack for close to a century.

DEAN
You can't stall forever.

ALASTAIR
John Winchester. Made a good name for himself. A hundred years. After each session, I'd make him the same offer I made you. I'd put down my blade if he picked one up.

DEAN
Just give me the demon's name, Alastair.

ALASTAIR
But he said nein each and every time. Oh, damned if I couldn't break him.

DEAN takes off his leather jacket.

ALASTAIR
Pulled out all the stops, but John, he was, well, made of something unique. The stuff of heroes. And then came Dean. Dean Winchester. I thought I was up against it again.

DEAN drinks from a bottle of something probably alcoholic.

ALASTAIR
But daddy's little girl, he broke. He broke in thirty. Oh, just not the man your daddy wanted you to be, huh, Dean?

DEAN puts down the bottle.

ALASTAIR
Now.

DEAN picks up a jigger and fills it from a large bottle of water that has a rosary in it.

ALASTAIR
Now we're getting somewhere. Holy water? Come on. Grasshopper, you're gonna have to get creative to impress me.

DEAN looks up finally.

DEAN
You know something, Alastair? I could still dream. Even in hell. And over and over and over, you know what I dreamt? I dreamt of this moment.

ALASTAIR begins to look nervous. DEAN picks up a needle.

DEAN
And believe me, I got a few ideas.

DEAN fills the needle from the jigger, sprays a little water from it, and goes over to ALASTAIR.

DEAN
Let's get started.

INT. NEXT ROOM - NIGHT

CASTIEL hears ALASTAIR screaming.

ACT TWO


INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

ALASTAIR
Oh, man. Ooh.

DEAN puts the needle back on the cart with his other tools.

DEAN
Let me know if you want some more. There's plenty left.

ALASTAIR
Go directly to hell. Do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars.

DEAN smiles.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

RUBY chants, holding a lit candle to the corner of a map. SAM watches the fire spread around the edges.

RUBY
Relax. The fire is our friend. Besides, the only part of the map we need is the 'where's Dean?' part. Out.

The flames vanish. The map is charred to unreadability; a small circle in the middle is untouched.

RUBY
There. Your brother's there. It's a good thing angels aren't concerned with hiding their dirty business. Not used to being spied on. I mean, who'd be stupid enough to try?

SAM
Ruby, it's been weeks. I need it.

RUBY
You don't seem too happy about it.

SAM
You think I wanna do this? This is the last thing I—

SAM sits on the bed.

SAM
But I need to be strong enough.

RUBY straddles SAM's lap.

RUBY
It's okay. It's okay, Sammy. You can have it.

RUBY kisses SAM. She pulls a knife from an ankle sheath and cuts her arm, drawing blood. SAM drinks it straight from the vein. RUBY strokes his hair.

RUBY
It's okay, Sam.

RUBY smirks.

INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN holds up Ruby's knife. ALASTAIR looks at it and laughs.

ALASTAIR
There's that little pig-poker. I wondered where it went.

DEAN dips a ladle into a bowl of what is presumably holy water and pours it over the blade.

ALASTAIR
Do you really think this is gonna fix you? Give you closure? That is sad. That's really sad. Sad, sad.

DEAN approaches ALASTAIR, watches for a moment, and stabs him. A sizzling sound.

ALASTAIR
I carved you into a new animal, Dean. There is no going back.

DEAN
Maybe you're right. But now it's my turn to carve.

ALASTAIR
No!

The view pans to a faucet that is turned by an unseen hand. It begins to drip, right onto the chalk of the devil's trap on the floor.

INT. NEXT ROOM - NIGHT

CASTIEL listens to ALASTAIR's groans. The light flickers, catching CASTIEL's attention; the bulb explodes. ANNA appears behind CASTIEL.

CASTIEL
Anna.

ANNA
Hello, Castiel.

CASTIEL turns to look at her.

CASTIEL
Your human body—

ANNA
It was destroyed, I know. But I guess I'm sentimental. Called in some old favors and...

ALASTAIR becomes slightly more audible.

CASTIEL
You shouldn't be here. We still have orders to kill you.

ANNA
Somehow I don't think you'll try. Where's Uriel?

CASTIEL
He went to receive revelation.

ANNA
Right.

INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN pulls the knife out of ALASTAIR, whose head falls forward. DEAN tilts it back up, ignoring the blood. ALASTAIR laughs.

ALASTAIR
Now it's your professionalism that I respect.

DEAN turns away, disgusted. ALASTAIR spits blood.

INT. NEXT ROOM - NIGHT

ANNA
Why are you letting Dean do this?

CASTIEL
He's doing God's work.

ANNA
Torturing? That's God's work? Stop him, Cas, please. Before you ruin the one real weapon you have.

CASTIEL
Who are we to question the will of God?

ANNA
Unless this isn't his will.

CASTIEL
Then where do the orders come from?

ANNA
I don't know. One of our superiors, maybe, but not him.

INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN splashes ALASTAIR in the face with holy water; it steams and sizzles. ALASTAIR gargles.

DEAN
Who's murdering the angels?

ALASTAIR chokes.

INT. NEXT ROOM - NIGHT

ANNA
The father you love. You think he wants this? You think he'd ask this of you? You think this is righteous?

CASTIEL can't meet her eyes.

ANNA
What you're feeling? It's called doubt.

INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

ALASTAIR screams and chokes. DEAN pours out more holy water, splashes ALASTAIR in the face, and watches him sizzle.

INT. NEXT ROOM - NIGHT

ANNA touches CASTIEL's hand.

ANNA
These orders are wrong and you know it. But you can do the right thing. You're afraid, Cas. I was too. But together, we can still—

CASTIEL
Together?

CASTIEL yanks his hand away.

CASTIEL
I am nothing like you. You fell. Go.

ANNA
Cas.

CASTIEL
Go.

ANNA vanishes. CASTIEL listens to ALASTAIR scream.

INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

ALASTAIR spits out blood and holy water.

ALASTAIR
You're just not getting deep enough. Well, you lack the resources. Reality is just, I don't know, too concrete up here. Honestly, Dean...

DEAN pours salt into another container.

ALASTAIR
You have no idea how bad it really was, and what you really did for us.

DEAN, whispering
Shut up.

ALASTAIR
The whole bloody thing, Dean. The reason Lilith wanted you there in the first place.

DEAN
Well, then I'll just make you shut up.

DEAN grabs ALASTAIR's chin.

ALASTAIR
Lilith really—

DEAN pours salt into ALASTAIR's mouth. ALASTAIR tries to scream.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

SAM drives through rain. He looks exactly like himself in the montage in 3.11 Mystery Spot.

INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

ALASTAIR spits out blood and tries to breathe.

ALASTAIR
Something caught in my throat. I think it's my throat.

DEAN
Well, strap in, 'cause I'm just starting to have fun.

DEAN goes back to his cart.

ALASTAIR
You know, it was supposed to be your father.

DEAN pours out more holy water.

ALASTAIR
He was supposed to bring it on. But, in the end, it was you.

DEAN
Bring what on?

ALASTAIR
Oh, every night, the same offer, remember? Same as your father.

DEAN shakes salt onto the blade of Ruby's knife.

ALASTAIR
And finally you said, "Sign me up." Oh, the first time you picked up my razor, the first time you sliced into that weeping bitch...

DEAN turns to face ALASTAIR.

ALASTAIR
That was the first seal.

DEAN does not visibly react. He walks closer.

DEAN
You're lying.

ALASTAIR
And it is written that the first seal shall be broken when a righteous man sheds blood in hell. As he breaks, so shall it break.

DEAN turns away.

ALASTAIR
We had to break the first seal before any others. Only way to get the dominoes to fall, right? Topple the one at the front of the line.

Now that DEAN is not facing ALASTAIR, his shock is visible on his face.

ALASTAIR
When we win, when we bring on the apocalypse and burn this earth down, we'll owe it all to you, Dean Winchester.

DEAN closes his eyes, trying not to react.

ALASTAIR
Believe me, son, I wouldn't lie about this. It's kind of a religious sort of thing with me.

ALASTAIR notices the dripping faucet and the broken edge of the devil's trap.

DEAN
No. I don't think you are lying. But even if the demons do win...

DEAN looks at Ruby's knife.

DEAN
You won't be there to see it.

DEAN turns around. ALASTAIR is right behind him, out of the chains.

ALASTAIR
You should talk to your plumber about the pipes.

ALASTAIR punches DEAN, who goes down. ALASTAIR grins.

ACT THREE


INT. PRISON ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN is covered in blood. ALASTAIR holds him by his shirt collar and punches him repeatedly, then drops him and picks him up by the throat and shoves him up against the hexacle, lifting his feet off the floor.

ALASTAIR
You got a lot to learn, boy. So I'll see you back in class bright and early Monday morning.

ALASTAIR turns around. CASTIEL is behind him with Ruby's knife. ALASTAIR drops DEAN, who doesn't move, to focus on CASTIEL, who stabs him in the shoulder. The injury sparks gold light, but not as much as when it kills.

ALASTAIR
Well, almost. Looks like God is on my side today.

CASTIEL lifts a hand. The knife twists itself. ALASTAIR grunts in pain and pulls out the knife, then tosses it away and charges CASTIEL. They fight. ALASTAIR slams CASTIEL against the wall, choking him.

ALASTAIR
Well, like roaches, you celestials. Now, I really wish I knew how to kill you. But all I can do is send you back to heaven.

ALASTAIR chants in Latin. Blue light appears in CASTIEL's eyes and mouth. ALASTAIR stops abruptly, choking, and is slammed against the wall. SAM has arrived, one hand raised. CASTIEL slumps to the ground.

ALASTAIR
Stupid pet tricks.

SAM
Who's murdering the angels? How are they doing it?

ALASTAIR
You think I'm gonna tell you?

SAM
Yeah, I do.

SAM twists his hand. ALASTAIR's eyes roll white and he chokes.

SAM
How are the demons killing angels?

ALASTAIR
I don't know.

SAM
Right.

ALASTAIR
It's not us. We're not doing it.

SAM
I don't believe you.

ALASTAIR
Lilith is not behind this. She wouldn't kill seven angels. Oh, she'd kill a hundred, a thousand.

SAM stops.

ALASTAIR
Oh, go ahead. Send me back, if you can.

SAM
I'm stronger than that now. Now I can kill.

SAM holds out his hand. Gold light flares inside ALASTAIR as he screams. ALASTAIR's host collapses, dead.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

DEAN is in bed, heavily bandaged with a breathing tube and an IV drip. SAM sits next to him. CASTIEL appears at the doorway, pauses, and continues down the hallway. SAM follows him out of the room.

CASTIEL
Sam—

SAM
Get in there and heal him. Miracle. Now.

CASTIEL
I can't.

SAM
You and Uriel put him in there—

CASTIEL
No.

SAM
—because you can't keep a simple devil's trap together.

CASTIEL
I don't know what happened. That trap...it shouldn't have broken. I am sorry.

SAM
This whole thing was pointless. You understand that? The demons aren't doing the hits. Something else is killing your soldiers.

CASTIEL
Perhaps Alastair was lying.

SAM
No, he wasn't.

SAM goes back to DEAN. CASTIEL looks as though he has been slugged in the face.

EXT. SNOWY PARK - DAY

URIEL sits on a bench, eyes closed. CASTIEL appears.

URIEL
Castiel, I received revelation from our superiors. Our brothers and sisters are dying and they...they want us to stop hunting the demon responsible.

CASTIEL sits next to URIEL.

URIEL
Something is wrong up there. I mean, can you feel it?

CASTIEL
The murders. Maybe they aren't demonic. Sam Winchester said the demons had nothing to do with it.

URIEL
If not the demons, what could it be?

CASTIEL
The will of heaven. We are failing, Uriel. We are losing the war. Perhaps the garrison is being punished.

URIEL
You think our father would—

CASTIEL
I think maybe our father isn't giving the orders anymore. Maybe there is something wrong.

URIEL stands up.

URIEL
Well, I won't wait to be gutted.

URIEL vanishes.

EXT. SNOWY STREET - NIGHT

CASTIEL
Anna. Anna, please.

The streetlight above CASTIEL flickers. He looks up, then turns around.

ANNA
Decided to kill me after all?

CASTIEL
I'm alone.

ANNA
What do you want from me, Castiel?

CASTIEL
I'm considering disobedience.

ANNA nods.

ANNA
Good.

CASTIEL
No, it isn't. For the first time, I feel...

ANNA
It gets worse. Choosing your own course of action is confusing, terrifying.

ANNA puts her hand on CASTIEL's shoulder. He looks at it; she drops it.

ANNA
That's right. You're too good for my help. I'm just trash. A walking blasphemy.

ANNA turns to walk away.

CASTIEL
Anna.

ANNA stops.

CASTIEL
I don't know what to do. Please tell me what to do.

ANNA turns back.

ANNA
Like the old days? No. I'm sorry. It's time to think for yourself.

ANNA vanishes.

INT. PRISON ROOM - DAY

CASTIEL examines the devil's trap. He notices the dripping faucet and shuts it off without touching it.

URIEL
You called?

URIEL enters.

URIEL
What do you say, Castiel? Will you join me? Will you fight with me?

CASTIEL
Strange. Strange how a leaky pipe can undo the work of angels when we ourselves are supposed to be the agents of fate.

URIEL
Alastair was much more powerful than we had imagined.

CASTIEL
No. No demon can overpower that trap. I made it myself. We've been friends for a long time, Uriel. Fought by each other's sides, served together away from home, for what seems like forever. We're brothers, Uriel. Pay me that respect. Tell me the truth.

URIEL
The truth is, the only thing that can kill an angel...

A blade slides out of URIEL's sleeve into his grasp.

URIEL
...is another angel.

ACT FOUR


CASTIEL
You.

URIEL
I'm afraid so.

CASTIEL
And you broke the devil's trap, set Alastair on Dean.

URIEL
Alastair should never have been taken alive. Really inconvenient, Cas. Yes, I did turn the screw a little. Alastair should have killed Dean and escaped, and you should have gone on happily scapegoating the demons.

CASTIEL
For the murders of our kin?

URIEL
Not murders, Castiel. No. My work is conversion. How long have we waited here? How long have we played this game by rules that make no sense?

CASTIEL
It is our father's world, Uriel.

URIEL
Our father? He stopped being that, if he ever was, the moment he created them. Humanity, his favorites. This whining, puking larva.

CASTIEL
Are you trying to convert me?

URIEL
I wanted you to join me. And I still do. With you, we can be powerful enough to—

CASTIEL
To...

URIEL
To raise our brother.

CASTIEL
Lucifer.

URIEL
You do remember him? How strong he was? How beautiful? And he didn't bow to humanity. He was punished for defending us. Now, if you want to believe in something, Cas, believe in him.

CASTIEL
Lucifer is not God.

URIEL
God isn't God anymore. He doesn't care what we do. I am proof of that.

CASTIEL
But this? What were you gonna do, Uriel? Were you gonna kill the whole garrison?

URIEL
I only killed the ones who said no. Others have joined me, Cas. Now, please, brother, don't fight me. Help me. Help me spread the word. Help me bring on the apocalypse. All you have to do is be unafraid.

CASTIEL
For the first time in a long time, I am.

URIEL smiles. CASTIEL punches him through the wall several feet away. URIEL gets up. They fight. URIEL clobbers CASTIEL with a metal bar; CASTIEL goes down.

CASTIEL
You can't win, Uriel. I still serve God.

URIEL
You haven't even met the man. There is no will. No wrath. No God.

Between each phrase, URIEL punches CASTIEL. The last time, he raises his fist and is stabbed through the neck from behind.

ANNA
Maybe. Or maybe not. But there's still me.

ANNA pulls out URIEL's blade. URIEL collapses. ANNA goes over to CASTIEL. URIEL screams as white light flares in his eyes and mouth. The light explodes out of him and out of the building. CASTIEL stands up and looks down at URIEL's corpse. His wings are seared into the floor across the devil's trap.

ACT FIVE


INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

DEAN is still in bed, though the breathing tube is gone. CASTIEL sits next to him.

CASTIEL
Are you all right?

DEAN
No thanks to you.

CASTIEL
You need to be more careful.

DEAN
You need to learn how to manage a damn devil's trap.

CASTIEL
That's not what I mean. Uriel is dead.

DEAN
Was it the demons?

CASTIEL
It was disobedience. He was working against us.

DEAN
Is it true? Did I break the first seal? Did I start all this?

CASTIEL
Yes. When we discovered Lilith's plan for you, we laid siege to hell and we fought our way to get to you before you—

DEAN
Jump-started the apocalypse.

CASTIEL
And we were too late.

DEAN
Why didn't you just leave me there, then?

CASTIEL
It's not blame that falls on you, Dean, it's fate. The righteous man who begins it is the only one who can finish it. You have to stop it.

DEAN
Lucifer? The apocalypse? What does that mean? Hey! Don't you go disappearing on me, you son of a bitch. What does that mean!

CASTIEL
I don't know.

DEAN
Bull.

CASTIEL
I don't. Dean, they don't tell me much. I know our fate rests with you.

DEAN
Well, then you guys are screwed. I can't do it, Cas. It's too big. Alastair was right. I'm not all here. I'm not—I'm not strong enough. Well, I guess I'm not the man either of our dads wanted me to be. Find someone else. It's not me.

DEAN begins to cry.
