TEASER
INTERIOR – BUNKER – NIGHT

[The Bunker emergency red light is on. Gunshots and screams are heard. A man is flung against the wall, as DEAN comes into view, holding a gun. They fight before DEAN shoots him, and another man behind him. DEAN flings the man against the door and then onto the ground. He falls to the ground as DEAN shoots him again, twice. A sparking sound can be heard. The men are demons.]

[DEAN moves down the hallway, holding his gun in front of him. There are dead bodies on the ground. Another demon appears and fights DEAN. He pushes the demon against the wall and shoots him. The demon falls and dies. DEAN moves around the corner, when a bald man appears and holds DEAN’s gun. He lets the man move behind him, and DEAN taps him on the shoulder. He signals for the man to move down the hallway.]

[DEAN moves around the corner into the next hallway. Another demon approaches DEAN and they fight. DEAN flips him over and rolls, shoots another demon that runs at him, before he turns and shoots the demon he was fighting.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[DEAN enters the kitchen, his gun out as he looks around and sees dead bodies everywhere. He turns to the side and sees BENNY sitting upright, injured. He crouches in front of him.]

DEAN

Benny?

BENNY

Dean.

DEAN

Hey.

BENNY

Dean.

DEAN

Hey, you’re gonna be okay.

BENNY

Nah. I’m not. I… I’ll see you on the other side, brother.

DEAN

Benny…

[BENNY’s head lulls forward. He dies.]

DEAN

Benny.

[DEAN gets up and moves towards a man who is still awake. He is a demon. DEAN kicks the demon’s gun away and grabs him by the shirt. He lifts him up and points his gun at him.]

DEAN

Where is he?

DEMON

He’s closer than you think.

DEAN

Where?!

[The demon’s eyes flash to black.]

DEMON

Maybe I’ll tell you. Right before I rip out your…

[DEAN shoots the demon. He sparks out as he dies. DEAN looks back at BENNY’s body.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER WAR ROOM – NIGHT

[There are dead bodies around the room and on the map table. DEAN walks in with his gun pointed. SAM turns the corner. DEAN approaches him as he aims his gun at him.]

SAM

He was right. Closer than you think.

DEAN

Sam?

SAM

You know, I knew you’d come looking for me. After Sioux Falls… I suppose you had to.

DEAN

What you did to them… what you did to Bobby… to Jody…

SAM

They tried to stop me. But I will not be stopped.

DEAN

Sammy, listen to me. This is the demon blood. You have to fight it!

SAM

Why would I do that?

[The bald man from earlier approaches behind SAM. SAM turns his head slightly and the man’s neck snaps as he falls to the ground. SAM looks back at DEAN with an evil smile.]

DEAN

Sammy, please. Please.

[SAM smirks. His eyes flash to black. He cocks his head to the side. Dean’s neck snaps as he falls to the ground. He’s dead.]

INTERIOR – SAM’S BEDROOM – DAY

[SAM jolts awake. He breathes heavily as he sits up in bed. He looks around his room.]

[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE
INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – DAY

[DEAN is eating bacon. SAM walks in.]

DEAN

Morning.

SAM

Morning.

DEAN

Rough night?

SAM

Yeah, just, uh… weird dreams.

DEAN

Yeah, been there. Why don’t you eat something? You’ll feel better.

SAM

Dean, you know I don’t eat –

DEAN

It’s veggie bacon.

SAM

What?

DEAN

You’ve been asking for it.

SAM

Yeah. But every time I ask for it, you say, and I’m quoting, “I don’t want any of that hippie, Sarah McLaughlin grass-eater crap in the Meat Man’s kitchen”. Which, by the way, for what it’s worth, you got to stop calling yourself “The Meat Man”. It… it doesn’t mean what you think it means.

DEAN [scoffs]

Yeah, it does. Anyway, it’s not that bad. Give it a shot.

SAM

I’m good.

DEAN

No, you’re not. The past few days, you’ve barely come outta your room. Look, man, I get it, okay? With Jack… and Rowena… Rowena knew what she was getting herself into. She knew what needed to be done.

SAM

Doesn’t make it any easier.

DEAN

No, it doesn’t.

[DEAN looks at SAM and passes him the tablet.]

DEAN

Here. In the last month, Beaverdale, Iowa, has seen more than a half-dozen cattle mutilations.

SAM

So, what, mountain lion, or…

DEAN

Mm. Three days ago, a girl’s body showed up… ripped to pieces. Now, local badges think they’ve got themselves a psycho on their hands, but I mean come on, man, that sounds exactly like our thing. So, let’s go check it out.

SAM

You know, Dean, you can handle this on your own, or… or call up some of the other hunters…

DEAN

No, no. You and me. Sam, we need this.

[DEAN pats SAM on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen. SAM picks up a piece of bacon and bites into it. He scrunches his face and spits it out.]

SAM

That… that’s real bacon, Dean.

[DEAN appears in the archway of the kitchen and points at him.]

DEAN

You’re damn right it is.

[He points at himself.]

DEAN

Meat Man!

[He walks away.]

EXTERIOR – BEAVERDALE HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

[Students are walking into school.]

MRS BAILEY

Yeah, watch the bikes. Davis, use a crosswalk. Let’s go! Keep it moving!

[She turns to SAM who is wearing his FBI suit.]

SAM

So… our victim…

MRS BAILEY

Susie Martin.

SAM

Yeah.

MRS BAILEY

What happened to her, I can’t even imagine.

SAM

The police said she was last seen here.

MRS BAILEY

After cheer practice.

SAM

And the, uh, security cameras?

MRS BAILEY

Uh, the police checked but nothing.

SAM

Was she close to anyone?

MRS BAILEY

Susie was close to everyone. She was part of the drama club, debate team, cheerleading, campus ministry… you name it.

SAM

Any best friends?

[MRS BAILEY looks behind her and spots a group of girls.]

MRS BAILEY

Mostly Veronica and the girls. They’re putting together a prayer vigil for her.

[HENRY and JANET WHITMAN approach MRS BAILEY.]

JANET WHITMAN

Excuse me, Mrs. Bailey?

MRS BAILEY

Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Whitman, how can I help you?

JANET WHITMAN

Well, it’s just… we heard a rumor that the game is gonna be cancelled this Friday?

MRS BAILEY

Oh, not cancelled, rescheduled… for the service. For Susie.

JANET WHITMAN

Right. And we’re so sorry about what happened to her. I mean, it’s just so, so horrible, but…

[She looks at her husband HENRY WHITMAN.]

HENRY WHITMAN

Uh, we had a scout coming to that game for Billy. From Yale.

SAM

A young lady is dead, and you’re worried about a football game?

JANET WHITMAN

It’s lacrosse. Who are you?

MRS BAILEY

Agent Plant, FBI.

HENRY WHITMAN

Oh.

JANET WHITMAN

It’s just, Yale’s Billy’s first choice, and if he doesn’t get in it’ll be the end of the world.

SAM

Actually, the end of the world is the end of the world.

JANET WHITMAN

Of course.

SAM [sarcastically]

Of course.

JANET WHITMAN

But maybe you could have the… the little prayer thing at halftime? Or…

MRS BAILEY

No.

HENRY WHITMAN

Well, is…

MRS BAILEY

No.

JANET WHITMAN

I see. Well… thank you for your time.

[JANET and HENRY WHITMAN glance at SAM before they leave. MRS BAILEY turns back to SAM.]

MRS BAILEY

I swear, the parents are worse than the kids.

EXTERIOR – BEAVERDALE HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

[DEAN leans against the Impala and eats pretzels. SAM walks over to him.]

SAM

Hey. Any luck at the morgue?

[DEAN tosses SAM a small plastic container.]

SAM

Is that a…?

DEAN

Vamp fang.

SAM

Vampires drain their victims. Vamps don’t rip their bodies apart.

DEAN

Apparently this one does. And it gets a little weirder. Coroner said that there were no signs of defensive wounds, so it’s like she didn’t even fight.

SAM

So, whoever killed her, maybe it was someone she knew. And according to the vice principal, she kind of knew everyone.

DEAN

Oh, that’s awesome.

[The Beaverdale Beaver mascot goes back on a scooter.]

DEAN

That’s awesome. Ha!

[DEAN walks around the Impala and gets into the drivers seat.]

You see that beaver?

EXTERIOR – BEAVERDALE HIGH SCHOOL – NIGHT

[TORI walks to her car.]

TORI

I know. Cheer practice was so long, right? I swear, Veronica’s so fake. “I’m lost without Susie. It’s like a piece of my heart is gone”. Gag me.

[She unlocks her car.]

Okay, yeah. Later.

[She hangs up the phone. The bushes nearby rustle as something jumps out at her. She screams.]

ACT TWO
[Exterior shots of the town; the Impala drives down a back road.]

EXTERIOR – FOREST – DAY

[SAM and DEAN kick dirt and sticks around a patch of ground marked off by crime scene tape.]

SAM

So, this is where they found Susie’s body?

DEAN

Yeah, you notice what’s missing?

SAM

Blood.

DEAN

So, how does a freak gut a girl and not make a mess?

SAM

By killing her somewhere else and dumping her here.

DEAN

Looks like.

SAM

Yeah. Great.

DEAN

Well, local police are freaked. Never seen anything like this. They got no idea how to deal.

SAM

Of course not. That’s our job. We keep them from dealing with the truth, with what’s out there, and we carry the weight. It’s great. Meanwhile, they get to go back to living in their white picket fence bubbles.

DEAN

You know, ever since you were a kid, you wanted to live in a town like this. Lame, normal…

SAM

Yeah, we don’t get normal. And these towns, everything’s the end of the world. You’re late for work, your kid doesn’t get into the right school… whatever. They don’t… They have no idea what’s out there.

[SAM’s phone rings. He answers.]

SAM

Vice Principal Bailey? Yes. Really? Of course, uh, on our way.

[He hangs up.]

We got another one.

EXTERIOR – BECKY’S HOME – DAY

[Two kids get into a car. ROD walks behind them.]

ROD

Seat belts, seat belts.

JUNIOR

We know, dad.

[ROD pats his jacket.]

ROD

Got this, got that, got that.

BECKY

You’re forgetting something.

[BECKY approaches ROD.]

BECKY

Motion-sickness pills… for Junior.

ROD

He would’ve been fine, babe. It’s just Lake Michigan. Hardly any chop.

BECKY

Four hours in a boat? Rod, Junior gets seasick in the tub.

ROD

Where would I be without you?

BECKY

Covered in puke.

[BECKY taps on the window.]

Have fun, sweeties!

JUNIOR

Thanks, Mom, we will.

[ROD and BECKY kiss.]

ROD

Wow. Felt that. You can’t wait to have the house to yourself.

BECKY

Oh, you have no idea.

[ROD gets in the car and drives away.]

JUNIOR

Bye, mom!

[BECKY waves as they leave. The car drives away and reveals CHUCK standing across the street. He waves at BECKY. She sees him and runs towards the house. CHUCK runs towards her.]

CHUCK

Becky, wait! Becky, please. Becky, please wait.

BECKY

What are you doing here?

CHUCK

I just… I wanted to… I needed to see you.

BECKY

Well, I don’t want or need to see you.

CHUCK

I’m sorry, I… I know we’re not together anymore, and it seems like you’re doing great. I just – I… I wanted to talk. Catch up. It’s been a rough couple of weeks.

BECKY

That’s not my problem.

[She turns to walk into the house.]

CHUCK

Wait, Becky, please. I don’t have anywhere else to go.

INTERIOR – MRS BAILEY’S OFFICE – DAY

MRS BAILEY

Tori Taylor never came home last night. She was talking to a friend on the phone, in the parking lot, and then… gone.

SAM

What about her vehicle?

MRS BAILEY

It’s still there, which is…

DEAN

Not good.

MRS BAILEY

Her parents are worried sick. They… do you think she and Susie…

SAM

Let’s start with this. The girls, did they have anything in common?

MRS BAILEY

They’re both cheerleaders.

DEAN

Well, somebody’s got a fetish.

MRS BAILEY

Excuse me?

DEAN

I, uh… we’ll look into it.

INTERIOR – BECKY’S HOME – DAY

[CHUCK looks around at Becky’s Supernatural collectibles and merchandise.]

CHUCK

What are these?

BECKY

My maquettes.

CHUCK

You… make them?

BECKY

I run the most successful Etsy site for unofficial “Supernatural” merchandise in the country. Probably the world.

CHUCK

Wow. So you’re still, um…

BECKY

Still what?

[She hands CHUCK a drink.]

CHUCK

Uh, obsessed with my work.

BECKY

You mean my work. Look, what you were writing, it was real… like, really real. You sort of channelled Sam and Dean’s lives because you’re a prophet.

CHUCK

I… Yeah. Yes, I am.

BECKY

And, sure, I got a little obsessed, and it took me to a dark place. What I did to Sam… [shudders] So, after some pretty intensive counselling, I realized I wasn’t in love with the real Sam Winchester. I loved his character. So instead of reading your stories, I kept writing my own.

CHUCK

Your own… “Supernatural”?

BECKY

Where the guys didn’t have to hunt monsters all the time. They just sit around and do laundry and talk, you know? I mean, that’s what people like the most, anyway.

CHUCK

Well, I mean, people like monsters.

BECKY

Meh. Anyway, I got an online following, and it wasn’t paying the bills, so I started making these handcrafted miniatures. They took off, started turning a profit, and here I am.

CHUCK

Right. Right, right, right, right, right. But people like monsters though. They do. I mean, Leviathans are cool. What? They’re all teeth!

BECKY

Anyway, I have the house to myself for the first time in months. This was supposed to be my catch-up day. I have billing to do, orders to fill, three AU Fic deadlines breathing down my neck. So, if you want to talk, talk. Fast.

[BECKY stares CHUCK down.]

CHUCK

Like, there’s… like, they don’t even have lips. They’re just, like, teeth face. Raa!

BECKY

Chuck!

CHUCK

Okay.

BECKY

Now.

CHUCK

Alright. Fine. Alright, so I had a bit of a falling out.

BECKY

With who?

[CHUCK moves into BECKY’s living room. He points to a pair of SAM and DEAN Pop Vinyl Bobble-heads.]

BECKY

The Winchesters?

[He sits down on the couch.]

CHUCK

Things were said. Uh… Now I’ve found msyself low on, um… resources. I went to ask my sister for help, and she rejected me. ‘Cause she sucks. And now I’m just… stuck. So, I thought I’d come see you, my number-one fan. And, I don’t know, see if you can help make me feel big again.

BECKY

So, you want me to… fluff you?

CHUCK

I mean, no.

BECKY

You do. You thought you could just come back to me, your pathetic ex, your number-one fan, and get what you’ve always gotten from me… a nice big crank on your ego.

CHUCK

Well, I mean…

BECKY

Well, sorry, that’s not me anymore, Chuck. I am married to an amazing man, I have two great kids, and I like myself, Chuck. For the first time in a long time, I like myself. So, I don’t need you.

CHUCK

I know. You don’t need me. No one does. I’m happy for you, Becky, that you like yourself. Because… I kind of hate me right now.

BECKY

Really?

CHUCK

Yeah, I just don’t know what I’m doing. I feel so lost.

[BECKY sits down on the couch in front of CHUCK.]

BECKY

Okay. Well… what makes you happy?

CHUCK

Writing. Creating.

BECKY

Then, Chuck, you have to write.

EXTERIOR – BEAVERDALE HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

[DEAN eats a hotdog as he talks to the Beaver mascot, TOBY.]

DEAN

Really? You’re sure?

[TOBY nods.]

DEAN

Okay, alright. Thanks, Toby. Appreciate it.

[TOBY rolls away on his scooter. SAM walks over to DEAN.]

SAM

Seriously? We’re questioning mascots now?

DEAN

Smart kid. He’s actually got a full ride to IU. Don’t underestimate the mascot, man. The guy’s got access. He knows a lot about cheerleaders. In a mostly non-creepy kind of way. Anyway, so, turns out Susie was in charge. Then with her gone, Tori was set to take over, except…

SAM

Not anymore.

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Okay. So, who’s third in line to the throne?

DEAN

Mm. Not the mascot, but he knows.

INTERIOR – SCHOOL GYM – DAY

[There are several photos of Susie. VERONICA hands BILLY a wrist band that says “SUSIE FOREVER” on it.]

BILLY

I can’t believe she’s really…

VERONICA

I know. It’s just… It’s like a piece of my heart is gone. Billy, I know you and Susie were close, but if there’s anything you need…

BILLY

I…

JANET

Billy!

[BILLY turns to see JANET WHITMAN standing in the gym. BILLY turns back to VERONICA.]

BILLY

I have to go.

VERONICA

Yeah.

[BILLY walks over to his mom, JANET. They leave the gym. VERONICA walks over to a podium in front of rows of empty seats.]

VERONICA

We are here to celebrate the life of my friend, Susie… No. We are here to celebrate the life of my best friend, Susie… my best friend, Susie, who I miss like… like she was a part of me. And in many ways, she is still a part me. She’ll always be a part of all of us. Susie Martin was as rare as a ghost orchid, and as unique as a snowflake. So beautiful inside and out. But as Robert Frost tell us, “nothing gold can stay”. And that’s what Susie was… pure gold.

[DEAN slow claps sarcastically as he and SAM approach VERONICA.]

DEAN

That’s good stuff. Especially the part about the snowflake, and uh, getting choked up. I mean, if you’re gonna milk it, really get in there and squeeze, you know?

VERONICA

I’m sorry. Who are you?

SAM

FBI. We’re here about Susie.

VERONICA

Uh, you mean about who killed her?

DEAN

Yeah. Yeah, now that’s gone and then Tori, really kind of worked out for you, didn’t it?

[SAM holds a needle full of Dead Man’s blood behind his back.]

SAM

We should talk. Outside.

VERONICA

Um, I… I think I should go.

SAM

Wait, wait, wait. Veronica… do you have braces?

[She looks at them strangely.]

VERONICA

Yeah. So?

EXTERIOR – BEAVERDALE HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

[SAM and DEAN exit the school.]

DEAN

Friggin’ braces?

SAM

Kinda makes it impossible to fang out.

DEAN

Alright, so if she’s not our vamp, then who is?

[SAM looks around and sees a security camera.]

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME – DAY

[BILLY and JANET are in the kitchen.]

JANET

You weren’t out front. I had to find you.

BILLY

It was embarrassing, Mom. I just wanted to help. Susie would’ve wanted…

JANET

No. We do not say her name. Would you talk to your son, please?

[HENRY enters the kitchen and starts to wash his hands in the sink.]

HENRY

Just listen to your mother.

[BILLY and JANET look at each other before he walks away.]

JANET

Really? I need wine.

[HENRY washes his hands in the sink. Blood washes off his hands and down the drain.]

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOUSE GARAGE – DAY

[A girl is lying on a cot, tied up, gagged and blindfolded. It’s TORI. She whimpers and screams.]

ACT THREE
INTERIOR – BECKY’S HOME – DAY

[CHUCK shakes his glass around.]

CHUCK

You have anything stronger?

BECKY

We have cran-apple juice.

CHUCK

Hmm. I’m good. It’s just, things are different now, Becky. I mean, I used to be able to see Sam and Dean in my head, wherever they were, whatever they were doing. It was all just there, ripe for the picking. And now it’s just gone.

BECKY

Because you lost your prophet powers?

CHUCK

Yeah. Something like that.

BECKY

Then write about something else.

CHUCK

But this is it. I mean, this is my favorite story.

BECKY

Then write about them.

[CHUCK stands up as does BECKY.]

CHUCK

I-I… okay. I feel like we’re going in circles now.

BECKY

No, you’re going in circles. You’re a writer, a writer who’s not writing. And when a writer’s not writing, they feel sad, and they get lost. And the writer asks themselves, “why do I feel this way?”, “why am I so sad and lost?”. And what does all this navel-gazing and hair-pulling amount to in the end? Procrastination. Distraction. Just one of a million ways the writer avoids doing the one thing that is all but guaranteed to make the writer feel better. Which is…?

CHUCK

Writing. But what if I can’t?

BECKY

You can. The only question is, will you?

CHUCK

How’d you learn all this?

BECKY

I’m a writer, too, Chuck.

CHUCK

Oh. I mean, fanfic… it’s not really the same thing…

BECKY

Writing’s writing. The self-sabotage, the doubts, the struggle against time. So, whenever I have a spare minute, I write.

[BECKY and CHUCK stare at each other.]

CHUCK

Yeah. Yeah!

[CHUCK runs out of the living room to BECKY’s office. He sits at the desk and in front of the open laptop.]

BECKY

Wait! I didn’t mean right now…

[CHUCK puts on his glasses and holds a finger up to BECKY.]

CHUCK

Shh, shh, shh!

[CHUCK starts typing.]

INTERIOR – MRS BAILEY’S OFFICE – DAY

[SAM, DEAN and MRS BAILEY are watching security footage from the parking lot.]

MRS BAILEY

This is the security footage from last night.

SAM

Do we have any idea who that might be?

[The footage shows TORI get grabbed.]

MRS BAILEY

No clue. He’s wearing a mask.

DEAN

Well, crap.

[The footage shows a car drive past.]

SAM

Wait a second. Go back.

[MRS BAILEY rewinds and stops the footage on the car.]

SAM

Uh, zoom into that.

[She zooms in on the licence plate.]

DEAN

You got it?

SAM

Yeah.

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME – NIGHT

[JANET stands in the kitchen; BILLY sits at the counter and HENRY sits at the table behind him.]

BILLY

You’re worried about the game? I mean, this is insane!

JANET

This is what we’ve worked for, what we’ve sacrificed so much for.

BILLY

Well, I never asked you to.

JANET

We’re your parents. You don’t need to ask. Everything that we have done has been for you. We just want you to be happy.

[JANET cries as she leaves the kitchen.]

HENRY

Son, we’re trying our best. W-What do you want from us?

BILLY

Listen to what I’m saying… I don’t want anything. I never wanted any of this! That’s the point!

[The doorbell rings. BILLY walks to the front door and opens it to reveal SAM and DEAN on the other side.]

SAM

Hi.

DEAN

Your dad home?

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME GARAGE – NIGHT

[TORI continues to whimper and struggle.]

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME – NIGHT

[BILLY walks into the living room. SAM and DEAN follow him.]

BILLY

Uh, dad?

[HENRY stands up and walks towards them.]

HENRY

Billy, get upstairs. Now.

[BILLY leaves the room. HENRY looks between SAM and DEAN.]

DEAN

Good thinking. You don’t want the kid to see this part.

HENRY

I don’t know what you’re talking about.

SAM

Yeah, sure you do. Those girls that went missing… that was you.

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME GARAGE – NIGHT

[TORI continues to struggle.]

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME - NIGHT

[SAM hears a noise.]

SAM

On it.

[SAM leaves and heads for the garage.]

HENRY

Look, arrest me. Fine. Just… just please leave my family out of it.

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME GARAGE – NIGHT

[SAM enters the garage and flicks on the lights. He sees TORI lying on the cot.]

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME – NIGHT

[DEAN stands in front of HENRY.]

DEAN

Arrest you?

[He takes out a machete from behind his back.]

DEAN

No, see? We’re not FBI.

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME GARAGE – NIGHT

[SAM crouches down in front of TORI.]

SAM

Shh. I’m here to help, okay? Just hang in there. Hang in there.

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME – NIGHT

[DEAN walks towards HENRY with the machete pointed at him.]

DEAN

And we know exactly what you are.

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME GARAGE – NIGHT

[SAM spots a blood bag and tube attached to TORI.]

SAM

I’m gonna get you out of here, okay? I got you.

[SAM picks her up and cradles her in his arms. A gun cocks. SAM turns to the entrance and sees JANET pointing a gun at him.]

JANET

You shouldn’t be here.

ACT FOUR
INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME – NIGHT

[DEAN stands in front of HENRY.]

DEAN

Sammy, how’s it going back there?!

[SAM walks in as he carries TORI. JANET follows them, pointing her gun.]

DEAN

Okay. Was not expecting that. How’s she doing?

[SAM lays TORI on the couch.]

SAM

Not good. She’s lost a lot of blood. She needs a doctor.

HENRY

Janet, what are you doing?

JANET

I’m saving this family.

HENRY

No. Listen. It’s over, okay? They… they caught me. You just need to get Billy and leave. Please.

[She points her gun at SAM and DEAN.]

INTERIOR – BECKY’S HOME – NIGHT

[BECKY sits in front of the laptop, reading. CHUCK stands in front of the desk.]

CHUCK

Well?

BECKY

It’s so good! You did it. Congratulations!

[She stands up at the desk.]

CHUCK

Yeah? I mean, the story…

BECKY

I loved it. In fact, I’m feeling so inspired, I would love to just jump in and get back to my own work.

CHUCK

No, no, no, you’re shining me on.

BECKY

What? No, I’m not…

CHUCK

It’s a rough draft, Becky. You’ve gotta have some notes.

[BECKY shakes her head.]

CHUCK

Just, like, one note.

[She sits down again.]

BECKY

Okay. If I had to give one note… the jeopardy, Chuck. It’s feeling a little… thin? Low stakes? It’s fun to hear the boys’ voices, but a story is only as good as its villain, and these villains are just not feeling very… dangerous? Not to mention, there’s no classic rock. No one even mentions Cas. The climax is a little stale. Boys tied up again while we get the villain’s monologue, which, frankly, isn’t one of your best. A little originality wouldn’t…

[She looks up at him and gets scared. CHUCK scowls at her.

BECKY

… hurt.

CHUCK

You want jeopardy? You want danger?

[CHUCK moves around the desk.]

CHUCK

Move!

[BECKY gets up from the chair and he sits down. He starts typing.]

CHUCK

I’ll give you danger.

BECKY

Chuck? Chuck? Chuck!

[CHUCK continues to type.]

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME – NIGHT

[JANET still points the gun at SAM and DEAN. BILLY comes down the stairs.]

BILLY

Dad, what’s going… on…

DEAN

Your dad’s a vampire. That’s what’s going on.

[BILLY and HENRY look at each other. DEAN looks at HENRY.]

DEAN

Let me guess… few weeks ago, maybe a month, you had a run-in with something big and mean. It turned you. You thought you could deal. But the cow’s blood or whatever just wasn’t cutting it, so you upgraded to humans. How am I doing? Am I right?

[SAM looks at BILLY.]

SAM

No, I don’t think you’re right, Dean. It’s not the dad, it’s the son.

JANET

Shut your mouth!

BILLY

Mom.

HENRY

Billy, go!

BILLY

No. You’re right, about all of it. Okay? But what happened with Susie, I didn’t…

[flashback of BILLY and SUSIE in his car.]

We were together.

[They lean in and kiss.]

We were kissing. I could hear her heart.

[BILLY bites SUSIE’s neck.]

And her blood, and she…

INTERIOR – WHITMAN HOME – NIGHT

BILLY

It just tasted so good, I just…

[Flashback to BILLY’s fangs extending, he jumps at Susie. She screams.]

I couldn’t stop.

SAM

Then what?

BILLY

I told my mom and dad.

DEAN

So, you what? Chopped up the body? Made it look like some wannabe Bundy?

SAM

And then grabbed Tori and… and kept her as his own personal blood bag?

[Flashbacks to TORI being grabbed and in the garage.]

SAM

Awesome parenting. Awesome.

HENRY

This is not Billy’s fault. He was the victim. What were we supposed to do?

DEAN

You were gonna let me just cut off your head.

HENRY

You don’t have children, do you? Because if you did, you would know, that to see your child in pain rips your heart out. And you’d know that you’d do anything. You’d die for them.

JANET

Or kill for them.

[She points her gun at SAM and DEAN again.]

BILLY

Mom, no.

JANET

We can bury them out back, under the peonies. Everything is going to be fine.

SAM

There’s no way you believe that.

[JANET looks between SAM and DEAN. BILLY reaches for her gun.]

BILLY

Mom. Stop.

[He lowers her hand and the gun to the kitchen counter.]

JANET

We just wanted him to have a normal life.

BILLY

Mom, I can’t. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you. I can’t. I killed someone that I loved, and I’ll do it again. I know I will. I can’t control this!

[Flashback to BILLY and VERONICA in the gym.]

I’m a monster.

[Everyone looks at BILLY.]

BILLY

So, here’s what’s gonna happen. You’re gonna take Tori to the hospital, and you’re gonna tell them that I kidnapped her.

JANET

What? No.

BILLY

Dad said he was wearing a mask when he grabbed her. Tori won’t know. You tell them I took her… and I ran away.

HENRY

Billy. Don’t do this.

[BILLY turns to SAM and DEAN.]

BILLY

Then you and me… we’re gonna go for a ride. That’s how this works… right?

[SAM looks between HENRY and JANET. BILLY turns to JANET.]

BILLY

I’m sorry, Mom. But this is the best way. This is the only way.

[JANET cries as she hugs BILLY.]

[A montage of sequences: the Impala drives down the road. DEAN and SAM stand in a forest, BILLY kneels in front of them. Police arrive at the Whitman home. TORI is carried out on a stretcher. JANET and HENRY talk to the police. She shows the officer a picture of BILLY. DEAN stands behind BILLY in the forest. He lifts the machete and swings.]

ACT FIVE
INTERIOR – BECKY’S HOME – NIGHT

[CHUCK smiles. His back is to BECKY, who sits in front of the laptop. She is upset.]

BECKY

No. You can’t.

CHUCK

I did.

BECKY

Y… this is just an ending.

CHUCK

Yeah. I don’t know how I’m gonna get there, but I know where I’m goin’.

BECKY

B-But it’s so…dark.

CHUCK

But great, right? I can see it now… “Supernatural: The End”. And the cover is just a gravestone that says “Winchester”. The fans are gonna love it. Well?

BECKY

It’s awful! Horrible. It’s hopeless.

[BECKY gets up from the chair and walks around the desk to CHUCK.]

BECKY

You can’t do this to the fans. What you did to Dean? What you did to Sam?

CHUCK

There, see? It’s making you feel something. That’s good, right?

BECKY

No!

[The front door opens. ROD and the kids are back.]

ROD

Babe! We’re home! Babe!

[BECKY walks but turns to CHUCK.]

BECKY

You have to leave.

CHUCK

Nah, I kinda like it here.

[ROD enters the living room.]

ROD

Babe, you wouldn’t believe what happened.

[BECKY looks at CHUCK.]

BECKY

Please.

ROD

Junior was fine, but I puked everywhere.

[ROD walks in and sees CHUCK. He looks at BECKY, confused.]

ROD

Babe?

CHUCK

Hey.

[CHUCK snaps his fingers. ROD disappears in a puff of dust.]

BECKY

Rod?! What happened? Where is he?

CHUCK

He’s gone.

BECKY

What?!

[ROD JR. enters.]

ROD JR.

Hey, mom! We’re back! Dad got sick! He threw up all over the side –

[CHUCK snaps his fingers again. The kids disappear.]

BECKY

No! The kids.

CHUCK

Oh, don’t worry. They’re not dead. They’re just away.

[BECKY turns back to CHUCK.]

CHUCK

Oh, yeah. I’m God.

[BECKY looks horrified.]

BECKY

What are you… No. You bring them back. You bring them back!

[CHUCK smiles.]

BECKY

Please… you can’t do this.

CHUCK

Oh, Becky. I can do anything.

[CHUCK steps closer to BECKY. He snaps his fingers. She disappears in a puff of dust.]

CHUCK

I’m writer.

[CHUCK grins.]

INTERIOR – IMPALA – NIGHT

[DEAN and SAM drive down the road.]

DEAN

Well, that was an interesting one.

SAM

Yeah. What Henry did… we’d have done the same thing. For Jack. If we had the chance.

DEAN

Yeah. Yeah, we would. Look, man, I get it. I get it. We have lost way, way too much. And it’s hard not to feel like just… cashing out. I felt like that. After Chuck, back at the crypt. But you know what brought me back? You did. By sayin’ that what we do still matters. I mean, that’s why I wanted to drag us out here. That’s why I wanted to… to work a case, to save lives, you know? ‘Cause it is… it’s a… it’s crap job. We do the ugly thing so that people can live happy.

SAM

Yeah. Yeah. Lucky them.

DEAN

Yeah, lucky them. But it doesn’t change a thing. You know what I mean? We still do the job. But we don’t do it for us. We do it for Jack, for mom, for Rowena. We owe it to anybody who has ever given a damn about us to keep putting one foot in front of the other. No matter what. And hey, man, like you said, now that Chuck’s gone, we’re finally on our own. We are finally free to… move on, you know?

SAM

I don’t know. Uh… I-I don’t know if I can move on. You know, I-I-I… I can’t forget about any of them. Dean, I still think about Jessica. I… I can’t just let that go.

DEAN

No, man, that’s not what I’m talking about.

SAM

I know, I know, I know. I’m sorry. I know. But… but what I’m saying is that I don’t feel free. What we’ve done, what we’ve lost, right now, that is what I’m feeling, and… and sometimes it’s… it’s like I-I-I can’t even breathe. But maybe tomorrow. You know, maybe I’ll… I’ll feel better in the morning.

DEAN

And what if you don’t?

SAM

I don’t know.

[SAM looks out the Impala window.]

INTERIOR – BECKY’S HOME – NIGHT

[CHUCK sits in front of the laptop, typing furiously.]

CHUCK

Oh, yeah. This is gonna be good.

[The Dean and Sam Pop Vinyl Bobble-heads sit on the table next to him, on top of a black piece of paper with a anti-possession symbol on it. The bobble-heads shake as CHUCK types.]
