TEASER
EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

SUBTITLE
Medford, Wisconsin

We pan over a ferris wheel, past a fire eater and close on two clowns entertaining a young girl. She is clearly enjoying herself. Her parents stand behind.

DAD
God, I hate clowns. They always creep me out.

MOM
Shh. She likes them.
(leaning over)
Last ride.

The girl looks over to the side and seens a clown. She waves, it waves back a little creepy. She tugs on her mom's sleeve.

GIRL
Look, Mom, another clown!

When the mom looks over the clown has disappeared.

MOM
What are you trying to do, scare your father?

DAD
Hey.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The family is driving home from the carnival. The girl sees the clown again, on the side of the road, waving.

GIRL
Look, Mom, a clown!

The clown disappears again as Mom looks over.

GIRL
You missed him.


INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The girl is asleep in bed and hears something. She gets up and goes to the window, sees the clown standing outside. Smiling, she goes downstairs and waves at him, then opens the door to let him in. He takes her hand and enters.


TITLE CARD
SUPERNATURAL


ACT ONE
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

From the fiery title card we flash to a funeral pyre - JOHN'S. The only light comes from the wrapped, burning body. Standing behind, hands in their pockets, are SAM and DEAN. SAM is near tears and fidgeting, DEAN staring into the flames silently.

SAM
Before he.. before, did he say anything to you? About anything?

DEAN
(not looking at SAM)
No. Nothing.



EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

SUBTITLE
One Week Later

We pan over a junkyard containing cars in various states of demolition.

SUBTITLE
"Everybody Loves a Clown"

DEAN is underneath his car working on it, only his legs sticking out. It is little more than a rusted frame, but it looks considerably less crunched than last time. SAM approaches.

SAM
How's the car coming along?

DEAN
Slow.

SAM
Yeah? Need any help?

DEAN
(dropping something heavily)
What, you under a hood? I'll pass.

SAM
Need anything else, then?

DEAN pushes himself out from under the car and stands.

DEAN
Stop it, Sam.

SAM
Stop what?

DEAN
Stop asking if I need anything, stop asking if I'm okay. I'm okay. Really. I promise.

SAM
All right, Dean, it's just... We've been at Bobby's for over a week now and you haven't brought up Dad once.

DEAN
You know what? You're right. Come here. I'm gonna lay my head gently on your shoulder. Maybe we can cry, hug, and maybe even slow dance.

SAM
Don't patronize me, Dean, Dad is dead. The Colt is gone, and it seems pretty damn likely that the demon is behind all of this, and you're acting like nothing happened.

DEAN
What do you want me to say?

SAM
Say something, all right? Hell, say anything! Aren't you angry? Don't you want revenge? But all you do is sit out here all day long buried underneath this damn car.

DEAN
Revenge, huh?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Sounds good. You got any leads on where the demon is? Making heads or tails of any of Dad's research? Because I sure ain't. But you know, if we do finally find it - oh. No, wait, like you said. The Colt's gone. But I'm sure you've figured out another way to kill it. We've got nothing, Sam. Nothing, okay? So you know the only thing I can do? Is I can work on the car.

DEAN crouches by the car again, getting back to work.

SAM
Well, we've got something, all right?
(he pulls out a cell phone)
It's what I came by here to tell you. This is one of dad's old phones. Took me a while, but i cracked his voicemail code. Listen to this.
SAM hands the cell phone to DEAN, who stands and takes it reluctantly.

ELLEN'S VOICE
John, it's Ellen. Again. Look, don't be stubborn, you know I can help you. Call me.

SAM
That message is four months old.

DEAN
Dad saved that chick's message for four months?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Well, who's Ellen? Any mention of her in Dad's journal?

SAM
No. But I ran a trace on her phone number and I got an address.

DEAN
Ask Bobby if we can use one of his cars.



EXT. ROAD - DAY

In a beat-up, poorly maintained minivan, DEAN and SAM pull up to the Roadhouse Saloon.

DEAN
This is humiliating. I feel like a friggin' soccer mom!

SAM
It's the only car Bobby had running.
(They start looking around)
Hello? Anybody here?

DEAN
Hey. You bring the, uh,

SAM
Of course.

He tosses something to DEAN, who catches it. They open the door and go inside. The saloon is quiet except for a fly buzzing. A light bulb blows out. They go to the back and see a man passed out on the bar.

SAM
Hey, buddy?
(pause)
I'm guessing that isn't Ellen.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM goes into a back room, looking around. Dean goes down the steps, then pauses as he feels the point of a gun touch his back.

DEAN
Oh god, please let that be a rifle.

The gun cocks. Pan over to reveal an attractive blond girl.

JO
No, I'm just real happy to see you. Don't move.

DEAN
Not moving, copy that. You know, you should know something, miss. When you put a rifle on someone, you don't want to put it right against their back. Because it makes it real easy to do...
(He turns fluidly, grabbing the rifle and cocking it. )
That.

JO punches him in the face and takes back the rifle. DEAN doubles over, clutching his nose.
DEAN
Sam! Need some help in here.
(muttering)
I can't see, I can't even see.

The back door opens to reveal SAM, both hands on his head. He enters slowly.

SAM
Sorry, Dean, I can't right now. I'm a... little tied up.

He nods his head, indicating ELLEN, who is behind him with a handgun pointed at his head.

ELLEN
Sam? Dean? Winchester?
SAM and DEAN
Yeah.

ELLEN
Son of a bitch.

JO
Mom, you know these guys?

ELLEN
Yeah, I think these are John Winchester's boys.
(She lowers the gun, laughing.)
Hey, I'm Ellen. This is my daughter Jo.

JO also lowers her rifle, and DEAN smiles at her.

JO
Hey.

DEAN
You're not gonna hit me again, are you?

ELLEN is handing DEAN a small towel filled with ice.

ELLEN
Here you go.

DEAN
Thanks. You called our dad, said you could help. Help with what?

ELLEN
Well, the demon, of course. I heard he was closing in on it.

DEAN
What, was there an article in the Demon Hunters Quarterly that I missed? I mean, who, who are you? How do you know about all this?

ELLEN
Hey, I just run a saloon. But hunters have been known to pass through now and again. Including your dad a long time ago. John was like family once.

DEAN
Oh yeah? How come he never mentioned you before?

ELLEN
You'd have to ask him that.

DEAN
So why exactly do we need your help?

ELLEN
Hey, don't do me any favors. Look, if you don't want my help, fine. Don't let the door smack your ass on the way out. But John wouldn't have sent you if...
(She stops, realizing.)
He didn't send you.
(DEAN looks down, then back at SAM.)
He's all right, isn't he?

SAM
No. No, he isn't. It was the demon, we think. It, um, it just got him before he got it, I guess.

ELLEN
I'm so sorry.

DEAN
It's okay. We're all right.

ELLEN
Really? I know how close you and your dad were.

DEAN
Really, lady, I'm fine.

SAM
So look, if you can help, we could use all the help we can get.

ELLEN
Well, we can't. But Ash will.

SAM
Who's Ash?

ELLEN
Ash!

The man passed out on the bar jerks awake and sits up, flailing.

ASH
What? It closin' time?

SAM
That's Ash?

JO
Mm-hmm. He's a genius.

A brown folder is slapped down on the bar; SAM and ASH are sitting, DEAN standing behind them. JO is on the other side of the bar pouring glasses of water.

DEAN
You've gotta be kidding me, this guy's no genius. He's a Lynyrd Skynyrd roadie.

ASH
I like you.

DEAN
Thanks.

JO
Just give him a chance.

DEAN sits and opens the folder.

DEAN
All right. This stuff's about a year's worth of our dad's work, so uh, let's see what you make of it.

ASH pulls out the papers and starts rifling through them. He shakes his head.

ASH
Come on. This crap ain't real. There ain't nobody can track a demon like this.

SAM
Our dad could.

ASH
There are non-parametrics, statistical overviews, prospects and correlations, I mean.. damn! They're signs. Omens. Uh, if you can track 'em, you can track this demon. You know, like crop failures, electrical storms... You ever been struck by lightening? It ain't fun.

SAM
Can you track it or not?

ASH
Yeah, with this, I think so. But it's gonna take time, uh, give me... fifty one hours.

He gets up to leave.

DEAN
Hey, man?

ASH
Yeah.

DEAN
I, uh, I dig the haircut.

ASH
All business up front, party in the back.

As he leaves, JO walks by, flirting a little with DEAN. He checks her out tiredly, then gets up to follow her. SAM sees something behind the bar.

SAM
Hey, Ellen, what is that?

ELLEN
It's a police scanner. We keep tabs on things, we...

SAM
No, no, no, no, the, um, the folder.

ELLEN
Uh, I was gonna give this to a friend of mine. But take a look, if you want.

She takes a folder from the wall and places it in front of same. It has some newspaper clippings attached to the front, and on the front, in red marker:

COUPLE MURDERED
CHILD LEFT ALIVE
MEDFORD, WISC.

At the window, DEAN sits down by JO.

DEAN
How did your mom get into this stuff, anyway?

JO
From my dad. He was a hunter. He passed away.

DEAN
I'm sorry.

JO
It was a long time ago. I was just a kid. Sorry to hear about your dad.

DEAN
Yeah. So. I guess I've got fifty one hours to waste. Maybe tonight we should, uh...
(He looks up at her.)
No, you know what? Never mind.

JO
What?

DEAN
Nothing, just, uh, wrong place, wrong time.

JO
You know, I thought you were gonna toss me some cheap pickup line.
(Dean chuckles, embarrassed)
Most hunters come through that door think they can get in my pants with some... pizza, a six pack, and side one of Zeppelin IV.

DEAN
Well... what a bunch of scumbags.

JO
Not you.

DEAN
I guess not.

SAM
Dean, come here, check this out.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
A few murders, not far from here, that Ellen caught wind of. Looks to me like there might be a hunt.

DEAN
Yeah. So?

SAM
So, I told her we'd check it out.



EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Back in the minivan, DEAN and SAM drive. It's raining; SAM has the research open in his lap.

DEAN
You've gotta be kidding me. A killer clown?

SAM
Yeah. He left the daughter unharmed and killed the parents. Ripped them to pieces, actually.

DEAN
And this family was at some carnival that night?

SAM
Right, right. The, uh, Cooper Carnivals.

DEAN
So how do you know we're not dealing with some psycho carnie in a clown suit?

SAM
Well, the cops have no viable leads, and all the employees were tearing down shop. Alibis all around. Plus this girl said she saw a clown vanish into thin air. Cops are saying trauma, of course.

DEAN
Well, I know what you're thinking, Sam. Why did it have to be clowns?

SAM
Oh, give me a break.

DEAN
(laughs)
You didn't think I'd remember, did you? I mean, come on, you still bust out crying whenever you see Ronald McDonald on the television.

SAM
Well, at least I'm not afraid of flying.

DEAN
Planes crash!

SAM
And apparently clowns kill!

DEAN
So these types of murders, they ever happen before?

SAM
Uh, according to the file, 1981, the Bunker Brothers Circus, same M.O. It happened three times, three different locales.

DEAN
It's weird, though, I'm mean if it is a spirit it's usually bound to a specific locale, you know, a house, or a town.

SAM
So how's this one moving from city to city, carnival to carnival?

DEAN
Cursed object, maybe. Spirit attaches itself to something and the, uh, carnival carries it around with them.

SAM
Great. Paranormal scavenger hunt.

DEAN
Well, this case was your idea. By the way, why is that? You were awfully quick to jump on this job.

SAM
So?

DEAN
It's just... not like you, that's all. I thought you were hell-bent for leather on the demon hunt.

SAM
I don't know, I just think, this job, it's what Dad would have wanted us to do.

DEAN
What Dad would have wanted?

SAM
Yeah. So?

DEAN
Nothin'.



INT. FUNHOUSE - NIGHT

A little boy and his father are going through the funhouse at the carnival. The boy is playing a hand-held videogame and not really paying attention.

DAD
Check it out. Hey, look, Evan! Scary!

EVAN
Yeah, dad. Scary.

DAD
No, it's over here. Wow. You know, when I was your age this would have scared the pants off of me.

The boy ignores him. He looks up and sees the creepy clown from earlier waving at him. He looks around, and the clown is gone.

DAD
Evan? Hey! What is it?

EVAN
I... I saw a clown!

DAD
Don't be afraid of clowns. They're nice, they're your friends. Okay? Come on.



INT EVAN'S HOME - NIGHT

Evan's parents are asleep; he places a hand on his dad's arm.

EVAN
Dad. Dad!

DAD
(waking slowly)
Evan? What is it?

EVAN
You were right! He is my friend!

DAD
Huh?

He looks up to see the Clown holding Evan's hand. It smiles. He screams.

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO
EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

The squeaky minivan pulls up outside the carnival. They see what appear to be detectives talking to some carnies.

DEAN
Check it out. Five-oh.

SAM stands with his hands in his pockets as a three-foot-tall woman in a clown outfit passes him. He stares at her, nervous, and she stares back before moving on. DEAN approaches.

DEAN
Did you get her number?

SAM
(scowling)
More murders?

DEAN
Two more last night. Apparently they were ripped to shreds. And they had a little boy with them.

SAM
Who fingered a clown.

DEAN pauses, giving SAM a weird look.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Yeah, a clown, who apparently vanished into thin air.

SAM
Dean, you know, looking for a cursed object is like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles. They could be anything.

DEAN
Well, it's bound to give off EMF, so we'll just have to scan everything.

SAM
Oh, good, that's nice and... inconspicuous.

DEAN sees a "Help wanted... S. Cooper" sign.

DEAN
I guess we'll just have to blend in.



INT. BLIND MAN'S TENT - DAY

A man is throwing knives at a target; they all land near but not quite on bulls-eye.

DEAN
Excuse me, we're looking for a Mr. Cooper, have you seen him around?

BLIND MAN
What is that, some kind of joke?

He pulls of his sunglasses; he's blind.

DEAN
Oh. God, I'm, I'm sorry.

BLIND MAN
You think I wouldn't give my eyeteeth to see Mr. Cooper? Or a sunset, or anything at all?

DEAN
(quietly, to SAM)
Wanna give me a little help here?

SAM
Not really.

SHORT MAN
Hey man, is there a problem?

DEAN turns, then looks down to see an extremely short man in a red cape.

BLIND MAN
Yeah, this guy hates blind people.

DEAN
No, I don't, I...

SHORT MAN
Hey buddy, what's your problem?

DEAN
Nothing, it's just a little misunderstanding.

SHORT MAN
Little?! You son of a bitch!

DEAN
No, no, no, no! I'm just, could somebody tell me where Mr. Cooper is?
(Sam laughs.)
Please?



INT. MR. COOPER'S OFFICE

MR. COOPER
You boys picked a hell of a time to join up. Take a seat.

DEAN looks at the available chairs; one is normal, the other is pink, with a giant clownface on it. He beats SAM to the normal chair. SAM scowls, fidgeting before sitting gingerly in the clown chair.

MR. COOPER
We've got all kinds of local trouble.

DEAN
What do you mean?

MR. COOPER
Oh, a couple of folks got themselves murdered. Cops always seem to start here first. So, you two ever worked the circuit before?

SAM
Yes sir, last year through Texas and Arkansas.

DEAN
Yeah.

MR. COOPER
Doing what? Ride jockies? Butcher? ANS men?

SAM
Yeah, it's, uh, little bit of everything, I guess.

MR. COOPER
You two have never worked a show in your lives before, have you?

DEAN
Nope. But we really need the work. Oh, and uh, Sam here's got a thing for the bearded lady.

MR. COOPER
You see that picture? That's my daddy.

SAM
You look just like him.

MR. COOPER
He was in the business. Ran a freakshow. Till they outlawed them, most places. Apparently displaying the deformed isn't dignified. So most of the performers went from honest work to rotting in hospitals and asylums. That's progress. I guess. You see, this place, it's a refuge for outcasts. Always has been. For folks that don't fit in nowhere else. But you two? You should go to school. Find a couple of girls. Have two point five kids. Live regular.

DEAN is about to say something, but SAM leans forward, eyes serious.

SAM
Sir? We don't want to go to school. And we don't want regular. We want this.

DEAN looks at SAM.



EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

DEAN
Huh.

SAM
What?

DEAN
That whole, uh, I don't want to go back to school thing. Were you just saying that to Cooper or were you, you know, saying it? Sam?

SAM
I don't know.

DEAN
You don't know? I thought that once the demon was dead and the fat lady sings that you were gonna take off, head back to Wussy State.

SAM
I'm having second thoughts.

DEAN
Really?

SAM
Yeah. I think. Dad would have wanted me to stick with the job.

DEAN
Since when do you give a damn what Dad wanted? You spent half your life doing exactly what he didn't want, Sam.

SAM
Since he died, okay? Do you have a problem with that?

DEAN
Naw, I don't have a problem at all.



LATER

SAM is wearing a red "COOPER CARNIVAL" jacket and picking up trash, while surreptitiously scanning with the EMF reader. He goes into the funhouse, still scanning. A skeleton falls from the ceiling; Sam scans it, not getting a reading, but looks like he has an idea.



EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

Wearing a similar uniform jacket, DEAN is putting trash into a dumpster when his cell phone rings. He picks up.

DEAN
Hello?

SAM (on phone)
Hey, man.

DEAN
What's the matter? You sound like you just saw a clown.
SAM
Very funny. Skeleton, actually.

DEAN
Like a real human skeleton?

SAM
In the funhouse. Listen, I was thinking. What if the spirit isn't attached to a cursed object -- what if it's attached to its own remains?

DEAN
Did the bones give off EMF?

SAM
Well, no, but --

DEAN
We should check it out anyway. I'm heading to you.

As he hangs up the phone, the Blind Man grabs his arm.

BLIND MAN
What are you doing here, kid?

DEAN
I'm... I was just sweeping.

BLIND MAN
Bull. And what were you talking about? Skeletons? What's EMF?

DEAN
Dude, your blind man hearing is out of control.

BLIND MAN
We're a tight-knit group. We don't like outsiders. We take care of our own problems.

DEAN
We got a problem?

BLIND MAN
You tell me -- you're the one talking about human bones.

DEAN
Do you believe in ghosts?

BLIND MAN
What?

DEAN
My brother and me... umm. We're writing a book about them.



EXT. NEAR FUNHOUSE - DAY

Having gotten away from Blind Guy, Dean approaches Sam.

SAM
What took you so long?

DEAN
Long story.

LITTLE GIRL
Mommy, look at the clown!

DEAN and SAM both look over to see a little girl pointing at something.

MOM
What clown?

They look to where the little girl is pointing, but don't see anything.

MOM
Come on, sweetie, come on.

DEAN and SAM share a look.



EXT. FAMILY'S HOME - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are on stakeout outside the family's home.

SAM
Dean, I cannot believe you told Papazian about the homicidal phantom clown.

DEAN
I told him an urban legend about a homicidal phantom clown. I never said it was real.

DEAN pulls a gun and cocks it. SAM grabs at it, pushing DEAN'S hands down.

SAM
Keep that down!

DEAN
Oh, and get this. I mentioned the Bunker Brother's Circus in '81 and their, uh, evil clown apocalypse? Guess what.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Before Mr. Cooper owned Cooper Carnival, he worked for Bunker Brothers. He was their lot manager.

SAM
So you think whatever the spirit's attached to, Cooper just brought it with him?

DEAN
Something like that. (Shakes his head, sighs.) I can't believe we keep talking about clowns.



LATER

DEAN is dozing as a light goes on in the dining room. SAM shakes him awake. Inside, the little girl goes to the front door, where the phantom clown is waiting.

LITTLE GIRL
Wanna come in and play?

The clown nods, takes her hand and is led inside.


END ACT TWO


ACT THREE
INT. FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

As the girl leads the clown down the hallway, DEAN and SAM are already hiding in wait, weapons ready.

LITTLE GIRL
Wanna see Mommy and Daddy? They're upstairs.

SAM leaps out and grabs the girl, who starts screaming, as DEAN shoots the clown in the chest. It falls on its back, then gets up as DEAN is cocking the shotgun again.

DEAN Sam, watch out!

The clown leaps out the window, turning invisible as it runs away. The parents come rushing out.

DAD
What's going on here? Get away from my--

MOM
Oh my god, what are you doing to my daughter?!

DAD
Who the hell are you? Get out! Get out of my house!

DEAN and SAM leave the girl and run away terribly fast.

LITTLE GIRL
Mommy, Daddy, they shot my clown!



EXT. BACKROAD - DAY

DEAN and SAM have parked the minivan off the side of a road and are digging out their belongings - including the license plates.

SAM
You really think they saw our plates?

DEAN
I don't wanna take the chance. Besides, I hate this friggin' thing anyway.

They start walking down the road.

DEAN
Well, one thing's for sure.

SAM
What's that?

DEAN
We're not dealing with a spirit. I mean, that rock salt hit something solid.

SAM
Yeah, a person? Or maybe a creature that can make itself invisible?

DEAN
Yeah, and dresses up like a clown for kicks? Did it say anything in Dad's journal?

SAM
Nope.
(Sam clears throat, pulls out his cell phone)

DEAN
Who are you calling?

SAM
Maybe Ellen or that guy Ash'll know something. Hey, you think, uh, you think Dad and Ellen ever had a thing?

DEAN
No way.

SAM
Then why didn't he tell us about her?

DEAN
I don't know, maybe they had some sort of falling out.

SAM
Yeah. You ever notice Dad had a falling out with just about everybody?
(Dean nods casually; Sam lowers the phone.)
Well, don't get all maudlin on me, man.

DEAN
What do you mean?

SAM
I mean this "strong silent" thing of yours, it's crap.

DEAN
Oh, god.

SAM
I'm over it. This isn't just anyone we're talking about, this is Dad. I know how you felt about the man.

DEAN
You know what, back off, all right? Just because I'm not caring and sharing like you want me to.

SAM
No, no, no, that's not what this is about, Dean. I don't care how you deal with this. But you have to deal with it, man. Listen, I'm your brother, all right? I just want to make sure you're okay.

DEAN
Dude, I'm okay. I'm okay, okay? I swear, the next person who asks me if I'm okay, I'm gonna start throwing punches. These are your issues, quit dumping them on me!

SAM
What are you talking about?

DEAN
I just think it's really interesting, this sudden obedience you have to Dad. It's like, oh, what would Dad want me to do? Sam, you spent your entire life slugging it out with that man. I mean, hell, you, you picked a fight with him the last time you ever saw him. And now that he's dead, now you want to make it right? Well, I'm sorry Sam, but you can't, it's too little, too late.

SAM
Why are you saying this to me?

DEAN
Because I want you to be honest with yourself about this. I'm dealing with Dad's death! Are you?

SAM swallows, looks upset.
I'm going to call Ellen.



LATER

Further down the road, SAM is hanging up the phone.

SAM
Thanks a lot.
(to Dean)
Rakshasa.

DEAN
What's that?

SAM
Ellen's best guess. It's a race of ancient Hindu creatures. They appear in human form, they feed on human flesh, they can make themselves invisible, and they cannot enter a home without first being invited.

DEAN
So they dress up like clowns, and the children invite 'em in.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Why don't they just munch on the kids?

SAM
No idea. Not enough meat on the bones, maybe?

DEAN
What else'd you find out?

SAM
Well, apparently, Rakshasas live in squalor. They sleep on a bed of dead insects.

DEAN
Nice.

SAM
Yeah, and they have to feed a few times every twenty or thirty years. Slow metabolism, I guess.

DEAN
Well, that makes sense. I mean, the Carnival today, the Bunker Brothers in '81

SAM
Right. Probably more before that.

DEAN
Hey Sam, who do we know that worked both shows?

SAM
Cooper?

DEAN
Cooper.

SAM
You know, that picture of his father, that looked just like him.

DEAN
You think maybe it was him?

SAM
Well, who knows how old he is?

DEAN
Ellen say how to kill him?

SAM
Legend goes, a dagger made of pure brass.

DEAN
I think I know where to get one of those.

SAM
Well, before we go stabbing things into Cooper, we're going to want to make damn sure it's him.

DEAN
Oh, you're such a stickler for details, Sammy. (They smile at each other.) All right, I'll round up the blade, you go check if Cooper's got bedbugs.



EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

SAM picks the lock on Cooper's trailer and goes inside. Elsewhere, the Blind Man is leading DEAN.

BLIND MAN
Well, I've got all kinds of knives. I don't know if I've got a brass one, though.

In COOPER'S trailer, SAM pulls out a pocket knife and starts slicing open the mattress. A shotgun cocks behind him; COOPER is there, pointing the gun at him.

COOPER
What do you think you're doing?

In BLIND MAN'S trailer, he leads DEAN in and taps a trunk with his cane.

BLIND MAN
Check the trunk.

DEAN opens the trunk and finds a red clown wig. He pauses, stands.

DEAN
You?

BLIND MAN drops his cane, pulls off his glasses; his eyes look normal. Me. His eyes get cloudy, his face begins to melt. He waves, then his face disappears, cheshire-cat style with his eyes glowing last.

END ACT THREE


ACT FOUR
DEAN struggles with the door in BLIND MAN'S trailer, trying to get out. A knife flies past his head to bury in the door. He jumps. Another lands with a thunk a little higher.

DEAN yells: All right!

He manages to get the door open and books it out of there, tumbling. Outside, SAM sees him.

SAM
Hey!

DEAN
Hey.

SAM
So, Cooper thinks I'm a Peeping Tom, but it's not him.

DEAN
Yeah, so I gathered. It's the blind guy. He's here somewhere.

SAM
Well, did you get the --

DEAN
The brass blades? No. No, it's just been one of those days.

SAM
I got an idea. Come on.

They enter the funhouse; as they go through, a door slams between them. They struggle to open it.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM
Dean! Dean, find the maze, okay?

SAM finds a pipe organ, which is giving off steam. He grabs for one of the pipes, but it's too hot. Gah! SAM says, flinching from the heat. He takes something from his pocket and starts pulling off a pipe. DEAN comes around the corner.

DEAN
Hey.

SAM
Hey! Where is it?

DEAN
I don't know, I mean, shouldn't we see its clothes walking around?

A knife flies past Dean, pinning his sleeve to the wall. Another one pins his wrist.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM pulls the pipe all the way off and stalks forward slowly. A knife flies past his head; he dodges.

SAM
Dean, where is he?

DEAN
I don't know!

DEAN reaches up and pulls a lever; more steam pours from the pipe organ, giving a vague shape to the invisible attacker, which DEAN sees.

DEAN
Sam, behind you! Behind you!

SAM stabs the pipe behind him without looking. He turns and sees it buried in the still-invisible creature, blood pouring from the wound. DEAN manages to free himself. They look to where it's fallen and see only empty clothes and a bloody pipe.

DEAN
I hate funhouses.

END ACT FOUR


ACT FIVE
INT. ROADHOUSE SALOON - DAY

DEAN and SAM are sitting at the bar; ELLEN lays down a couple of beers.

ELLEN
You boys did a hell of a job. Your dad'd be proud.

SAM
Thanks.

JO, sitting down on the other side of DEAN, gives SAM a look.

SAM
Oh yeah, um, I've gotta... uh, uh, I've gotta go. Over there. Right now.

JO
So. (clears throat)

DEAN
So.

JO
Am I gonna see you again?

DEAN
Do you want to?

JO
I wouldn't hate it.

DEAN
Hmm. Can I be honest with you? See, normally I'd be hitting on you so fast it'd make your head spin. But, uh, these days... I don't know.

JO
Wrong place, wrong time? (she says, pointing at her mom)

DEAN
Yeah.

JO
It's okay, I get it.

The back door opens and ASH enters, carrying the folder and a bizarre looking laptop.

ASH
Where you guys been? Been waitin' for ya.

SAM
We were working a job, Ash. Clowns?

ASH
Clowns? What the --

DEAN
You got something for us, Ash?

ASH sets the laptop down on a table. It looks homemade, with exposed wiring.

SAM
Did you find the demon?

ASH
It's nowhere around. At least, nowhere I can find. But if this fugly bastard raises his head, I'll know. I mean, I'm on it like Divine on dog dookie.

SAM
What do you mean?

ASH
I mean, any of those signs or omens appear, anywhere in the world, my rig'll go off. Like a fire alarm.

DEAN reaches for the laptop.

DEAN
Do you mind...

ASH gives him a look. DEAN pulls his hand back from the keyboard. Yeah.

ASH
What's up, man?

SAM
Ash, where did you learn to do all this?

ASH
M.I.T. Before I got bounced for... fighting.

SAM
M.I.T.?

ASH
It's a school in Boston.

DEAN
Okay. Give us a call as soon as you know something?

ASH
Si, si, compadre.

DEAN takes another sip of his beer, then sets it down. ASH picks it up and drinks. DEAN and SAM head for the door.

ELLEN
Hey, listen -- if you boys need a place to stay I've got a couple beds out back.

DEAN
Thanks, but no. There's something I gotta finish.

ELLEN
Okay.



EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

DEAN is working on the car again, SAM pacing nearby.

SAM
You were right.

DEAN
About what?

SAM
About me and Dad. I'm sorry that the last time I was with him I tried to pick a fight. I'm sorry that I spent most of my life angry at him. I mean, for all I know he died thinking that I hate him. So you're right. What I'm doing right now, it's too little. It's too late. (His lips tremble.)
(beat)
I miss him, man. And I feel guilty as hell. And I'm not all right. Not at all. (Tears in his eyes.) But neither are you. That much I know.
(pause)
I'll let you get back to work.

SAM leaves. DEAN is still for a moment. He picks up a crowbar and smashes the window of a nearby car. Then he starts slamming it into the trunk of his own car, over and over. It clatters to the ground, and DEAN looks after where SAM has gone, lip trembling.
