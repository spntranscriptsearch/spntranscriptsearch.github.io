TEASER
INT. ABANDONED HOUSE

(Sam is unconscious on the floor, Dean shakes him)

DEAN Sam? Sam. S-sam? Oh, come on. (Dean shakes Sam more forcefully) Sammy! Come on, come on. Come on, damn it.

(Sam's eyes open. Hellfire flickers in them and then fades out)

SAM [ groans, exhales sharply ]

DEAN Hey, hey, hey, you with me?

SAM [ breathes deeply, groans ]

DEAN (hauls Sam off the floor) Come on. Come on, got to get you out of here.

SAM [ grunts ]

INT. COLLEGE SCIENCE LAB

( A janitor mops the floor, he hears a noise from behind him, then sees blood dripping on the floor by his mop. The blood is coming from a cut that his appeared on his forehead)

JANITOR What the...( as he exhales he sees his breath) Who's there?! ( the janitor runs and then screams as he is attacked by an anatomy dummy)

ACT I
EXT. STREET

SAM (groans lightly while pinching the bridge of his nose)

DEAN How you feel?

SAM Like I got hit by a...planet.

DEAN Well, lucky for you, I'm a doctor. I got joe, grub, and... (Dean holds up and shakes a container of pills)

SAM What are they?

DEAN Effective.

SAM I'm okay. Thanks.

DEAN Suit yourself.

SAM [ exhales sharply ] So, how long was I out, again?

DEAN I'm telling you, like two or three minutes. Why, what'd it feel like to you?

SAM About a week, give or take.

DEAN You want to talk about it?

SAM "It"?

DEAN Yeah, whatever that was. I mean, it was like you were freakin' electrocuted.

SAM Look, I mean, it wasn't fun, but I-I'm...Fine.

DEAN Fine. It was Hell, wasn't it? You got a big, fat faceful of hell. Ever cross your mind that you could've died?

SAM Oh, come on.

DEAN I'm serious. And none of this "it's just a flesh wound" crap. 'cause we did it your way. We let you go explore, and every bad thing that I said would happen happened. So guess what -- Past stays past. We're not kicking that wall again.

SAM So I'm supposed to just ignore it?

DEAN Yes.

SAM Dean...I might've done...who knows what, and you want me to just forget about it?

DEAN You shove it down, and you let it come out in spurts of violence and alcoholism.

SAM That sounds healthy.

DEAN Well, works for me.

SAM [ sighs ]

DEAN It's not a joke. Your life is on the line here, Sam. This is not a debate. I mean, first you were a-a soulless dickbag, and now you're not. So we good?

SAM Yeah. Sure.

DEAN Good. Well, let's get your mind off it, shall we? You, uh, up for a job?

SAM Well, what do you got?

DEAN Janitor murdered in a college lab last night. Doors were locked, nobody else in or out of the building.

SAM Great. Where to?

DEAN Paterson, New Jersey. Hey, maybe we'll have a Snooki sighting. (chuckles)

SAM What's a Snooki?

DEAN That is a good question.

INT. COLLEGE SCIENCE LAB

(Dean looks at an anatomy dummy and starts removing pieces)

DEAN Check it out. This thing's friggin' awesome! (hands Sam the plastic heart from the dummy) Be my valentine.

SAM Dude, we're working. Put it back.

DEAN Have a heart.

SAM Dean!

DEAN [ laughs ] Buzz kill. [ sniffs ] You smell sulfur?

SAM Yeah, we're in a science lab.

DEAN Right.

( Dean checks his phone and sees that Lisa is calling him)

SAM Who is it?

( Dean rejects the call)

SAM So, Lisa?

DEAN Maybe you should mind your own business.

SAM What's wrong with just talking to her, Dean?

DEAN Thanks, Dr. Laura. That's -- that's very insightful. Look at that -- our time's up.

(Sam's EMF meter goes off)

SAM Hey.

DEAN Whoa. Ghosts gone wild. Something's up in here.

SAM Question is, what?

DEAN Sam, good news. ( gesturing at the security camera) Big brother's watching.

( they watch the security footage)

INT. IMPALA

DEAN Hey. [ clears throat ] So, what'd you find out from the, uh, mop jockey's girlfriend?

SAM [ sighs ] nothing. Just how great he was -- went to church, donated to charity, rubbed her feet during "Glee."

DEAN I just threw up in my mouth.

SAM Sorry. Anyway, I checked his record -- spotless. What about the science building? Anything?

DEAN Built in '05. Nothing weird about the land. Before this, the biggest mishap was some genius accidentally spilled sulfuric acid on his crotch. They don't even dissect anything good in there. Anything bigger than Kermit, they use an iPad.

SAM So we got nothing?

DEAN Yeah, a big steaming pile of it.

INT. MANNEQUIN FACTORY - NIGHT

SECURITY GUARD Hello? Who's there?! Jonny?! [ chuckles ] Is that you?! [ gasps ] Okay. Ha ha, very funny. What the hell? (security guard is stabbed by a mannequin) Oh!

ACT II
INT. MANNEQUIN FACTORY - DAY

( the EMF meter goes off )

SAM Dean?

DEAN Yeah?

SAM This thing's humming.

DEAN Hmm.

SAM Wait. That anatomy dummy you were molesting at the lab.

DEAN Excuse me?

SAM What if that's what this is about?

DEAN What exactly are you accusing me of?

SAM I don't mean that. I mean, there was an anatomy dummy there, and here...

DEAN You're joking. You're not joking. Okay, uh, so, what, we've got -- we've got a bunch of killer dolls like...Chucky? I mean, come on, that's -- that's just...Friggin' creepy.

SAM I mean, if ghosts can possess humans and -- and move objects, why can't they possess this?

DEAN I suppose. But riddle me this, bat boy --Ghosts aren't exactly known for hopping county lines, right?

SAM True.

DEAN This one hits up a college and now a factory, what, three towns over? 

SAM Doesn't add up.

DEAN So we dig. Over there. (Dean waves his hand in front of a mannequin's face) I don't like the way Kim Cattrall's lookin' at me.

INT. OFFICE

DEAN Well, this dead guy's as squeaky clean as the last dead guy. I can't find a speck of dirt on him. You?

SAM Nothing. [ sighs ] Hmm. (looking at an article on the computer) Well, here's a speck. Uh, seamstress named Rose Brown went missing over a year ago. Uh, cops just gave up on her. Last seen at the factory, presumed dead. Survived by sister Isabel.

DEAN 50 bucks -- vengeful spirit.

SAM Pay sis a visit? All right.

(Dean's cellphone rings. It's Lisa calling)

SAM Answer it.

DEAN (answers his phone) Lisa?

BEN (via phone) Finally. I've been calling.

DEAN Ben? What are you --

BEN - something's wrong with mom.

DEAN What are you talking about?

BEN It's bad, Dean.

DEAN Define "bad."

BEN I-I don't know. S-she won't talk to me.

DEAN All right, put her on the phone.

BEN She won't come to the phone.

DEAN Ben, get your mom and put her on the phone.

BEN I-I-I can't. Her door's locked. She barely gets out of bed. I'm not kidding. Please just -- just come help me. I-I don't know what to do.

DEAN All right, let me call you back.

BEN Dean --

DEAN -five minutes.

EXT. MANNEQUIN FACTORY

DEAN Come on, man, I-I can't just leave.

SAM Dude, you got to leave.

DEAN Yeah, but we're talking life or death here.

SAM Right. I can handle it for 24 hours, Dean. I get you want to bury it. But I had to deal with my past year. You got to deal with yours.

DEAN Oh, yeah, and that worked so great for you.

SAM Come on. (watches Dean get into the Impala)

INT. ISABEL'S APARTMENT

SAM So, you and Rose were close, huh?

ISABEL Very. Our parents died when we were little, so we had each other.

SAM What was she like?

ISABEL Um, kind...giving. She had the biggest heart. But people gave her a hard time.

SAM How come?

ISABEL She was shy, a little awkward. I guess that made her an easy target. I feel like I've been defending her my whole life.

SAM I'm sure she appreciated it.

ISABEL Well, it went both ways. She did more for me than anybody else ever could. I just miss her.

SAM Um, may I? (Sam is touching a photo album on the coffee table)

ISABEL Sure. Please. Oh, it's a company Christmas party a couple years back.

SAM Wait, you work at Salzman & Sons, too?

ISABEL Well, everybody works at the factory. That's Rose.

EXT. ISABEL'S HOUSE

SAM (on the phone) Dean, hey, get this. That college janitor? He worked at the factory, too, until last year. Apparently, he quit right after Rose's disappearance.

DEAN (on the phone) So fair bet something happened to that girl around that factory, so let's call that joint ground zero.

SAM Right, but it still doesn't explain how a ghost ended up at a college in another zip code.

DEAN  It's not like she hopped the blue line.

SAM I'm headed to the factory now. I'll call when I get the whole scoop on Rose.

INT. MANNEQUIN FACTORY

SAM So, how long have you been here with the company?

JONNY I've been here about three years now. I'm sorry, w-what's this got to do with me?

SAM Relax. Just a routine questioning.

JONNY Oh. Okay.

SAM Uh, did you know Rose Brown?

JONNY Uh...Maybe. Uh, the name sounds kind of familiar.

SAM She was a seamstress here. She went missing about a year ago. Here. You mind taking a look? (Sam pulls out a photo of Rose)

JONNY Uh, yeah, I s--I saw her around.

SAM Anything you can tell me about her that might help?

JONNY Uh, look, I'd love to help, but I don't know anything. And, uh, I'm about to be late back from break, so --

SAM You seem nervous, Jonny.

JONNY Well...those guys that died were my friends. O-of course I'm gonna be upset.

SAM I didn't say upset. I said nervous. Here. (Sam hands him a business card) In case you remember anything.

EXT. LISA'S HOUSE

(Dean rings the doorbell )

LISA Dean, what are you doing here?

DEAN Well, you look absolutely fine.

LISA What's going on?

DEAN [ exhales sharply ] We've been "parent trapped."

LISA What?

DEAN Ben sent out a 911.

LISA Why would he do that?

DEAN You're going on a date, huh?

LISA Come in.

INT. LISA'S KITCHEN

DEAN You want to sit down?

LISA Not so much.

DEAN So, who's the guy?

LISA "Who's the guy?" His name is Matt. He's a doctor.

DEAN Oh, Dr. Matt. How respectable.

LISA Really? That's how this is gonna be?

DEAN Look, I-I --

LISA I called you six times, Dean.

DEAN And I almost called you back about 100.

LISA Good to know.

DEAN Lis, Ben called me. I dropped everything and ran. If you want to know if I care --

LISA Doesn't help me.

DEAN What do you want from me?

LISA I'm not asking for anything.

DEAN Well, then ask for something!

BEN Um...

DEAN Go to your room!

LISA Go to your room! You know, I...I can't. Ask for something. I know what I want. But I can't have it -- Not how you live. My phone rings, I think -- tiny chance it's you, big chance it's Sam calling to tell me you're dead.

DEAN Lis...

LISA No, don't. Don't apologize or anything. It's just... It's just I get to this place where I'm okay, and then you show up at our door. You keep doing that, every time I think I'm never gonna see you again. I'm trying to get over you. What are you trying to do? What do you want from us, Dean?

INT. FACTORY

JONNY (on the phone) Why am I flipping out?! I-I don't know, maybe 'cause of the feds! Maybe 'cause Dave and Steve are freaking dead. Look -- no. No. Just...Call me later. (blood drips on Jonny's hand and he finds a gash spreading across his forehead)

ACT III
(Jonny exhales, his breath visible)

SAM Come on.

JONNY What's going on?

SAM That was a ghost trying to kill you for being a dick.

JONNY What?

SAM You know what? You're lucky you are the most suspicious interview of all time. I figured something like this would happen.

JONNY Figured something like what would happen?

SAM Buddy, look, I don't have time for the big speech, all right? So, brass tacks -- Rose is back.

JONNY That's crazy!

SAM Look, you're gonna end up like your friends Unless you tell me what you did to Rose. Do you want me to help you or not?

JONNY It was just a stupid joke. You know, I mean, you -- you -- you play jokes. We didn't think it was that big of a deal.

SAM What did you do?

JONNY We made Rose think she had a secret admirer. I don't think the girl had ever been asked out in her life. Honestly, we just thought she was kind of pathetic...So we knew she'd take the bait. She was so excited. The poor girl never saw it coming.

(In the flashback, Rose enters an apartment where the guys have dressed up a mannequin and are waiting for her. They laugh at her confusion)

STEVE Look, Rose, I think he likes you.

JONNY It was mean. But you know how it is when a group of guys get together. They -- they act like jackasses.

STEVE Aw, don't be like that.

JONNY Come on, Rosey, it's just a joke!

ROSIE Go to Hell.

JONNY It happened so fast...

STEVE (grabs Rose's wrist) Hey, take a joke, Rosey. Seriously.

(Rose tries to break free and falls bashing her head on the table. She falls to the floor, dead)

JONNY We didn't mean for it to happen. And then it was too late.

STEVE What are you doing? 

JONNY I'm calling the cops.

STEVE Are you crazy? 

JONNY It was an accident.

STEVE We tricked her here. I grabbed her. That's involuntary manslaughter at least, and that's if they even believe us. You understand?

JONNY Steve said there was only one option. I wish I could take it all back.

SAM I'm sure you do.

JONNY I didn't kill her.

SAM Okay. Look me in the eyes and tell me none of it's on you. [ inhales sharply ] Look, I'm not saying you deserve to die. [ sighs ] I can help you.

JONNY How?

SAM You have to tell me where she's buried.

JONNY In the woods, a clearing off Canyon Run Road.

SAM No, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere.

JONNY But I --

SAM You need to stay inside the salt line until I tell you you're safe.

JONNY You just want me to stand here all night?!

SAM Consider it getting off easy.

INT. BEN'S BEDROOM (Ben is playing a video game)

DEAN Well, that's ridiculous. Plants could never kill a zombie.

BEN You think I'm gonna say "I'm sorry"?

DEAN And why would I think that? Because you lied to get me here?

BEN It was an emergency.

DEAN A date's not an emergency, Ben.

BEN It is if it's the third one. I watch TV. I know what that means.

DEAN (clears throat) Well, your mom's a grown-up. She gets to go out.

BEN Why won't you come home? Can't you just say "I'm sorry" and then come back?

DEAN I'm sorry. I can't.

BEN Can't or won't?

DEAN Both.

BEN So, you hate Mom now?

DEAN What? No, come on.

BEN So it's me.

DEAN Ben, stop it.

BEN Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

DEAN Listen to me. You didn't do anything. You understand that? Look, one day you'll, uh...You'll get this when you're older.

BEN Don't talk to me like I'm six.

DEAN Okay, fine. It's like this, then. Just 'cause you love someone doesn't mean you should stick around and screw up their life. So I can't be here.

BEN You think something will follow you home?

DEAN No. No, I don't, but I think my job turns me into somebody that can't sit at your dinner table. And if I stayed, you'd end up just like me.

BEN Why do you say it like you're so...bad?

DEAN Well, trust me, I'm not someone you want to aim to be.

BEN Don't I get a vote? 

DEAN No, you don't. I'm sorry, Ben. But, you see, this way you got a shot at living whatever life you want. You know, pick one. Pick five. 'cause with me, there's just the one road.

BEN You're a liar, Dean.

DEAN Excuse me?

BEN You say family's so important, but -- but what do you call people who -- who care for you, who love you even when you're a dick? You know you're walking out on your family, right?

EXT. ROSE'S GRAVE

SAM (on his phone while he watches Rose's corpse burn) All right, it's over. You're safe. And, Jonny? Look at this as a new beginning. Lot of chances not to be a jackass.

INT. JONNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

JONNY Jenny? Hon...We're leaving...tonight. So, pack up. Just the essentials. All I want is for us to move on with our lives. I love you. You know that. It's been...It's been really hard, Jen.

FINAL ACT
INT. JONNY'S APARTMENT - DAY

( Sam is at the crime scene. He sees Jonny's sex doll, "Jen" and calls Dean)

DEAN (Dean's voicemail message) This is Dean's other other cell, so you must know what to do.

SAM Hey, it's not over. Burning the remains didn't stop her. She's got to be hooked to something else. I'm gonna head to the sister's now. Call me.

INT. ISABEL'S APARTMENT

SAM (going through a box of Rose's things) So, um, this is it?

ISABEL I gave most of her clothes to the Goodwill. She didn't have much.

SAM Those yours?

ISABEL Yeah.

SAM Are you in school?

ISABEL Mm-hmm, yeah.

SAM Where?

ISABEL Uh, Great Falls.

SAM So let me guess...Um, you were at the chem lab and the factory this week.

ISABEL Well, yeah.

SAM Did you happen to stop by a bar called McOwen's last night?

ISABEL Everybody from the factory goes there. I stop in maybe three times a week. Why?

SAM That's it. So this is all about you.

ISABEL What? What is?

SAM The murders -- your coworkers, your college janitor.

ISABEL What, you -- you think I could do something like that?!

SAM No, no, no, no, no. But -- but I think you're at the center.

ISABEL Me? How?

SAM What are you wearing of Rose's? A ring? A bracelet? Her baby teeth in a locket? What?

ISABEL You're scaring me.

SAM Just think, please. What -- what do you have of Rose that you carry with you?

ISABEL I-I'm...

SAM What?

ISABEL Well, the only thing I have of hers is a part of me. When I was 16, she gave me one of her kidneys.

SAM Her kidney?

ISABEL Yeah.

SAM You're kidding.

ISABEL Will you please tell me what this is about?

SAM Yeah. Um...But I'm gonna need you to come with me.

EXT. STOREFRONT

DEAN So, that the girl with the haunted kidney?

SAM Yeah. 

DEAN Well, just when you think you seen it all.

SAM Right.

DEAN What do you want to do? Can't exactly burn the thing. I mean, she kind of needs it.

SAM Well, she can't just walk around with it, Dean. The spirit's attached. It's gonna use her to get close to anyone it wants revenge on. It's not gonna stop killing.

DEAN Okay, so what are you suggesting, that we cut it out of her? 

SAM And then what? Leave her in a tub of ice with a phone taped to her hand? 

DEAN Maybe we should call Dr. Robert. Might have some leads on some non-haunted, black-market replacement kidneys.

SAM He works out of a butcher shop.

DEAN It's pretty clean. You'd be surprised.

SAM No. I think we have to go hoodoo.

DEAN Hoodoo?

SAM Yeah, hoodoo.

DEAN That's more of a band-aid, not really a cure.

SAM It buys us a minute.

DEAN All right, Louisiana it is.

ISABEL Voodoo?! What the hell are you talking about?

DEAN Actually, it's "hoodoo." It's a little different.

SAM Hold on, Isabel.

ISABEL You're not feds.

SAM Just let us explain.

( The Impala revs up )

DEAN No. No way.

ISABEL  That's impossible. 

DEAN No, no, no, no, no, no. She possesses sex dolls! This -- this is not a sex doll!

( The Impala's lights turn on)

DEAN Hey, you leave my baby alone! She's got nothing to do with this! (The Impala drives at them) Go, go, go, go, go!

SAM Okay, here, here, here. (ushers Isabel into a car) Get in.

DEAN Son of a bitch! (Dean stands in front of the store window) I'm so sorry, baby.

(the Impala charges at Dean and crashes through the storefront)

SAM Okay. You all right?

DEAN Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. You guys?

SAM Yeah.

ISABEL Yeah, I'm...(blood pours out of Isabel's mouth and she looks down to find a giant glass shard sticking out of her stomach)

SAM Isabel? Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

ROSE'S SPIRIT I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this.

(Rose's spirit goes up in flames)

EXT. BOBBY'S SCRAPYARD - DAY

(Dean is repairing the Impala)

SAM How's it look?

DEAN Well, considering she got carjacked by poltergeist, could be worse. I mean, what exactly did we do back there, Sam?

SAM Yeah, I'm not putting it in the win column, either.

DEAN We saved a few dicks, a-a-and we killed an innocent girl. I got a heartbroken kid and a woman who's so pissed at me...I see what you mean about facing your past. It's, uh -  It's awesome. Thanks.

SAM Dean.

DEAN I mean, all we do is make a mess.

SAM That's not true. We do save lives, now and again.

DEAN Yeah, I guess. I'm just...I'm just tired of all the bad luck, you know?

SAM Well, you know, number one, bad luck is kind of in the job description. And two, it's not all bad. Really. Look at me. I mean, at least Satan's left the building.

DEAN Yeah. It's the little things.

SAM And I have a soul because of you. I never thanked you for that, did I?

DEAN That's all good, man.

SAM Well, thanks.

DEAN You'd have done the same for me.

SAM I mean it. Look, we keep our heads down, keep swinging. We'll lose some. Hopefully, we'll win more. And...I don't know. Anyway, for what it's worth, I got your back.

DEAN Yeah, I know.
