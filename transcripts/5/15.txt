NOW
EXT. CEMETERY – NIGHT

(In front of a headstone marked Clay James Thompson, a man reaches up through the soil and drags himself out of the grave.)


INT. BENNY SUTTON’S TRAILER – NIGHT

(Benny Sutton reclines on the sofa watching a documentary about cheetahs. A thunderstorm rages outside.)


DOCUMENTARY VOICEOVER

Here on the savannah, the wildebeest lounges, lazy and self-content, and is oblivious to the fierce predator that stalks him from the shadows.

The great wildebeest herds migrate south in search of water, drinking their fill in preparation for the long dry season to come. The wildebeest are on edge. Every movement could be a sound of potential attack. Merely a rustle of the wind through the bushes could scare the entire herd into a bone-crushing stampede.


(The trailer door rattles. Benny investigates, but it seems to be just the wind. He returns to the sofa.)


DOCUMENTARY VOICEOVER

At first the animal reacts with confusion…


(The wind blows the door open. Benny closes the door and locks it.)


DOCUMENTARY VOICEOVER

The wildebeest returns warily to its watering hole, where…


(Suddenly, behind him is a man covered in mud. Benny tries to fire a shotgun, but it’s empty.)


DOCUMENTARY VOICEOVER

...who are closing in for the kill. When it attacks, it attacks quickly.


BENNY

No.


(The man begins to strangle Benny.)


BENNY

Please! God! No!


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. DINER, SIOUX FALLS, SOUTH DAKOTA – DAY


(Sam and Dean get out of the Impala.)


SAM (on phone)

Bobby, listen, when you get this message, call! Okay?


DEAN (to Sam)

Is he still not home? How far could he get in that chair?


INT. DINER – DAY


SAM

So, what do we do?


DEAN

Well... Guess we just do it ourselves.


(They sit down at a table opposite a man.)


DEAN

Mr. Wells, why don't you tell us what you saw in your own words.


DIGGER

Call me Digger.


DEAN

Digger? Who gave you that name?


DIGGER

I did.


DEAN

You gave yourself your own nickname? You can't do that.


DIGGER

Who died and made you queen?


SAM

Okay. Uh, why don't you just tell us what you saw?


DIGGER

I saw Clay Thompson climb into Benny Sutton’s trailer through the window. Couple minutes later, Clay walked out, and Benny's dead.


DEAN

And, uh... (holds up photo) ...Is this the guy you saw?


DIGGER

Well, he was all covered with mud, but, yeah. That's Clay.


SAM

And you are aware that Clay Thompson died five years ago?


DIGGER

Yep.


DEAN

And you're positive that it was this guy.


DIGGER

You calling me a liar?


SAM

No, no, no. Of course not. Look. Can you think of any reason why Clay Thompson, alive or dead, would want to kill Benny Sutton?


DIGGER

Hell, yeah. Well, five years ago, Benny's the one that killed Clay in the first place.


DEAN

Is that a fact?


DIGGER

Well, yeah, so-called "hunting accident." Now, if you ask me... Clay came back from the grave to get a little payback.


DEAN

Go on.


(Sheriff Jody Mills enters the diner, talking on a cell phone.)


SHERIFF MILLS

Owen, put down the cupcake and pick up an apple… Okay? Okay. I love you.


DIGGER

Heads up. "Fargo."


SHERIFF MILLS

Digger.


DIGGER

Sheriff.


SHERIFF MILLS

Gentlemen. I'm Sheriff Jody Mills. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.


DEAN

Agents Dorfman and Neidermeyer. FBI.


SHERIFF MILLS

Welcome to Sioux Falls, gentlemen. Can I ask you what you're doing with Digger here?


DIGGER

They’re doing their job. They believe me, Sheriff.


SHERIFF MILLS

The FBI believes a dead man committed a murder?


SAM

Look, we're just asking a few questions, Sheriff. That's all.


DEAN

Of course, if a dead man didn't commit the murder, then, uh, who did?


SHERIFF MILLS

What'd you say your jurisdiction here was again?


DEAN

Our jurisdiction is wherever the United States government sends us.


SHERIFF MILLS

Oh, yeah. How 'bout me and your supervisor have a little chat about that?


SAM

Absolutely. (He hands her a business card.)


(Sheriff Mills calls the number on the card, and Bobby answers, pretending to be the FBI supervisor.)


BOBBY

Agent Willis speaking.


SHERIFF MILLS

Agent Willis, this is Sheriff Jody Mills… Bobby?


BOBBY

Oh… Excuse me?


SHERIFF MILLS

Is this Bobby Singer?


BOBBY

Listen, I don't know who this is, but... this is Agent Tom Willis of the FBI.


SHERIFF MILLS

Bull crap. FBI, huh?


SAM

So, uh... So you know Bobby Singer?


DEAN

That is... a fun coincidence.


SHERIFF MILLS

Here's what I know about Bobby Singer. He's a menace around here, ass-full of drunk-and-disorderlies and mail fraud. You understanding me?


DEAN

I think we all can agree that you've made yourself perfectly clear, yes.


SHERIFF MILLS

So, whatever the three of you are planning, it ends here. Now. Ten-four on that, Agents?


DEAN

Yeah.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY


DEAN

You know how many times we called? Where have you been?


BOBBY

Playing murderball.


DEAN

What's that smell? Is that soap? Did you clean?


BOBBY

What are you, my mother? Bite me!


SAM

Bobby, seriously.


BOBBY

I been working. You know, trying to find a way to stop the devil.


DEAN

Find anything?


BOBBY

What do you think?


SAM

Bobby, it's just… there's a case less than five miles from your house.


BOBBY

What, the – the Benny Sutton thing? That's what this is about?


DEAN

You knew about this?


BOBBY

Hell, yes. I checked into it already. There's nothing here.


SAM

Except a witness who saw a dead guy commit murder.


BOBBY

What witness? Digger Wells?


DEAN

Yeah. So?


BOBBY

So, he's a drunk.


SAM

Well, what about the lightning storms? They look like omens.


BOBBY

Except in February in South Dakota in storm season. Guys, I thought it was something, too. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.


SAM

So who killed the guy?


BOBBY

Take your pick. This Benny Sutton guy was a grade-a son of a bitch. There's a list of the living a year long wouldn't mind putting a cap in his ass.


DEAN

So, you're telling us... nothing?


BOBBY

Sorry. Looks like you wasted a tank of gas on this one.


DEAN

Great.


INT. IMPALA – NIGHT


(Dean parks the Impala near St. Anthony’s Cemetery.)


SAM

What's up?


DEAN

Isn't that the graveyard back there?


SAM

Yeah. So what? Bobby already checked it out.


DEAN

And? What, Bobby's never wrong? Come on. We'll take a peek, and then we'll hit the road. Can't hurt.


EXT. ST. ANTHONY’S CEMETERY – NIGHT


(Walking through the cemetery, Sam and Dean see a grave with overturned soil.)


SAM

Hey.


(Sam stops at Clay Thompson’s headstone.)


DEAN

That look fresh to you?


SAM

Yeah, actually.


(Sam and Dean dig up the grave and discover the coffin is empty.)


SAM

What is going on here?


DEAN

I don't know, but something stinks.


INT. CLAY THOMPSON’S HOUSE – NIGHT


(Sam and Dean break into the house and look around. A man attacks Dean, thinking he is a burglar. Dean pushes him to the ground.)


CLAY

Don't shoot me! Please! There's money in the safe.


DEAN

We don't want your money.


CLAY THOMPSON

What do you want? Anything. Please...


SAM

You're Clay Thompson, right?


CLAY

Who are you?


SAM

Um, FBI.


CLAY

FBI? Oh, my God. This is about Benny.


DEAN

Wha… what about Benny?


CLAY

He killed me! He shot me in the back! I'm supposed to let him get away with that?


DEAN

Hold up. Are… are you confessing?


CLAY

Please. I'll go with you. Just… just don't wake my kids.


SAM

Y-you'll go with us where?


CLAY

Jail.


DEAN

Let me get this straight. You're Clay Thompson, and you died five years ago?


CLAY

Yes.


DEAN

And three days ago you climbed out of your grave, and you killed Benny Sutton?


CLAY

Yes.


DEAN

So you are, in fact, a dead guy.


CLAY

I guess. I – I – I don't know what I am.


(Clay’s wife enters.)


CLAY’S WIFE

Clay? I called 911.


CLAY

It's okay, honey. These men are the FBI. They're here about Benny.


DEAN

Why don't you come with us, Mr. Thompson? I think that'd be best.


EXT. CLAY THOMPSON’S HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM

Dean.


DEAN

He's a monster.


SAM

He's a soccer dad.


DEAN

What do you want to do with him?


(Sheriff Mills and another police officer suddenly intercept them.)


SHERIFF MILLS

Freeze! Drop your guns!


DEAN

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. All right. Hey.


DEAN

Remember the guy you said that was dead and couldn't possibly commit murder? There he is.


SHERIFF MILLS

And?


DEAN

"And"? And you're welcome – for catching the undead killer zombie.


SHERIFF MILLS

Whatever he is or isn't that don't give you the right to shoot him in the middle of the street.


(Sheriff Mills handcuffs Dean.)


CLAY

Shoot me?


SHERIFF MILLS

You're free to go, Mr. Thompson.


DEAN

Free to go?!


CLAY

I can't believe you were gonna kill me.


DEAN

You're a zombie!


CLAY

I'm a taxpayer!


INT. JAIL CELL – NIGHT


DEAN

So, what? Sheriff's on the take?


SAM

Yeah. No. The zombies are paying her off?


(Sam sees Sheriff Mills and Bobby talking in the police station.)


SAM

Hey.


DEAN

So, what? Now they're friends?


INT. POLICE STATION – NIGHT


(Sam and Dean leave with Bobby. Sam pushes Bobby’s wheelchair.)


SAM

Bobby, I thought the sheriff hated you?


BOBBY

She did till five days ago.


DEAN

What happened five days ago?


BOBBY

The dead started rising all over town.


SAM

So you knew about this?


BOBBY

Yep.


DEAN

I think what Sam meant to say is, you lied to us?


BOBBY

Look, I told you there was nothing here. And there isn't. Not for you.


DEAN

There are zombies here.


BOBBY

There are zombies... And then there are zombies. Come with me.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN

You want to tell us what the hell…


(A woman wearing an apron walks to the table carrying a plate.)


KAREN SINGER

Oh, hey. I didn't realize you were bringing company.


BOBBY

It’s four a.m., babe. You didn't need to cook.


KAREN

Oh, please! I’ll get some more plates.


DEAN

Who was that?


BOBBY

Karen. My wife.


DEAN

Your new wife?


BOBBY

My dead wife.


ACT TWO
INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN (eating pie)

This is incredible, Mrs. Singer.


KAREN

Thank you, Dean.


(Sam frowns at Dean and gives him a pointed look.)


DEAN

What? It is.


BOBBY

It's great, Karen. Thanks. Could you, um, just give us a minute?


(Karen leaves the room.)


DEAN

Are you crazy? What the hell?


BOBBY

Dean, I can explain.


DEAN

Explain what? Lying to us? Or the American girl zombie making cupcakes in your kitchen?!


BOBBY

First of all, that's my wife, so watch it.


SAM

Bobby, whatever that thing is in there, it is not your wife.


BOBBY

And how do you know that?


SAM

Are you serious?


BOBBY

You think I'm an idiot, boy? My dead wife shows up on my doorstep, I'm not gonna test her every way I ever learned?


DEAN

So what is it? Zombies? Revenant?


BOBBY

Hell if I can tell. She's got no scars, no wounds, no reaction to salt, silver, holy water...


DEAN

Bobby, she crawled out of her coffin.


BOBBY

No, she didn't. I cremated her. Somehow, some way, she's back.


SAM

That's impossible.


BOBBY

Tell me about it.


SAM

You bury her ashes?


BOBBY

Yeah.


DEAN

Where?


BOBBY

In the cemetery. That's where they all rose from.


DEAN

How many?


BOBBY

15, 20, I made a list. (He hands the list to Sam.) Uh, there's Karen... Clay... Sheriff Mills – her little boy came back.


SAM

And there were no signs? No omens?


BOBBY

Well, there were the lightning storms.


DEAN

That's what we said. What else?


BOBBY (reads from the Book of Revelation)

"And through the fire stood before me a pale horse. And he that sat atop him carried a scythe, and I saw since he had risen, they, too, shall rise, and from him and through him."


DEAN

So, what, Death is behind this?


SAM

Death, Death? Like “Grim Reaper" death?


BOBBY

Yeah.


DEAN

Awesome. Another horseman. Must be Thursday.


SAM

Bobby... Why would Death raise 15 people in a podunk town like Sioux Falls?


BOBBY

I don't know.


DEAN

You know, if Death is behind this, then whatever these things are... it's not good. You know what we have to do here.


BOBBY

She doesn't remember anything, you know.


DEAN

What do you mean?


BOBBY

Being possessed, me killing her... her coming back.


DEAN

Bobby...


BOBBY

No, no, don't "Bobby" me. Just... just listen, okay? (Karen can be heard humming.) She hums when she cooks. She always... used to hum when she cooked. Tone deaf as all hell, but... And I never thought I would hear it again. Look, just read Revelation. The dead rise during the apocalypse. There's nothing in there that says that's bad! Hell, maybe it's the one good thing that comes out of this whole bloody mess.


DEAN

And what would you do if you were us?


BOBBY

I know what I'd do. And I know what you think you got to do. But... I'm begging you. Please. Please. Leave her be.


INT. DINER – DAY


SAM

So, what do you think?


DEAN

There's nothing to think about. I'm not gonna leave Bobby at home with the bride of Frankenstein.


SAM

Then what do you want to do? Just walk in there in front of Bobby and blow her skull off?


DEAN

If she decides that Bobby's face is the blue plate special, I'd like to be there.


SAM

Fine. See what else we can find out.


EXT. BOBBY’S SALVAGE YARD – DAY


(Dean is leaning against the Impala. He jumps at the sight of Karen next to him.)


KAREN

Oops. Did I scare you?


DEAN

No. No. No. There's... nothing scary about you at all.


KAREN

Feel like some lunch?


DEAN

Uh... I'm good. Thanks.


KAREN

Come on, there's more pie.


DEAN

I don't think that Bobby wants me inside.


KAREN

Guess it'll have to be our secret, then, huh? Come on.


EXT. SHERIFF MILL’S HOUSE – DAY


(Sam sneaks up to the window and sees Sheriff Mills and her husband reading a book to their young son.)


INT. BOBBY’S KITCHEN – DAY


(Dean is eating a piece of pie. There are many other pies in the room.)


DEAN

I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that you like pies. Did you bake all these?


KAREN

I don't know what it is. Since I got back, I can't stop baking.


DEAN

Yeah, when do you have time to sleep?


KAREN

I don't. Must be the excitement.


DEAN

Or being dead.


KAREN

I know you don't trust me.


DEAN

Why would you say that?


KAREN

Come on, Dean. That's why you're here, isn't it? Keeping an eye on me? I know who you are. Just like I know Bobby's not the same mild-mannered scrap dealer I married. You hunt things. I – I'm a thing. I get it.


DEAN

So then you know that Sam and I would never let anything happen to Bobby. That he's like a father to us.


KAREN

I understand. And he's lucky to have you looking out for him, Dean. But you're not the only one.


DEAN

Is that so?


KAREN

I remember everything, you know. When I died. That demon taking over my body... and the things it made me do. And Bobby having no choice but to... Well, you know what he did. But I can see it in his eyes when he looks at me. The guilt. It weighs on him.


DEAN

So why don't you just tell him you remember?


KAREN

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say you've never been in love. He's my husband. My job is to bring him peace... not pain.


EXT. HOUSE – DAY


(Sam looks at Bobby’s list and then knocks on the door.)


SAM

Mrs. Jones?!


(He opens the unlocked door.)


INT. EZRA JONES’ HOUSE – DAY


SAM

Ezra Jones? Um... Ezra Jones?


(An old lady lies in a bed, obviously sick, coughing and foaming at the mouth. She gestures for Sam to come closer.)


SAM

W-what is it? You think maybe you could tell me from here? Yeah. I'm gonna regret this.


(Sam leans close as she tries to say something. She attacks him, spitting mucous onto him in the process. Sam notices a dead man on the floor with his stomach bloodied. Sam shoots Mrs. Jones in the head through her open mouth.)


ACT THREE
INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT


BOBBY

Keep your damn voices down. Karen's upstairs.


DEAN

Oh, I'm sorry. We're a little tense right now. Who's old lady Jones?


BOBBY

The first one to come up.


SAM

First one to go bad.


BOBBY

Ah, she was always a nutty broad.


DEAN

Nutty how? Nutty like the way she ate her husband's stomach? Was that the level of nutty she was in life?


BOBBY

No.


DEAN

Look, Bobby, I feel for you. But you have got to acknowledge that you're not exactly seeing this straight!


SAM

Bobby, whether you admit it or not, these things are turning. We have to stop them – all of them.


(Bobby pulls out a gun and rests it on his lap.)


BOBBY

Time to go.


DEAN

What?


BOBBY

You heard me. Off my property.


SAM

Or what? You'll shoot?


BOBBY

If Karen turns, I will handle it my way.


DEAN

This is dangerous.


BOBBY (cocks gun)

I'm not telling you twice.


(Sam and Dean leave.)


INT. IMPALA – NIGHT I don't know.


DEAN

He's crazy.


SAM

It's his wife, Dean.


DEAN

So he goes "Full Metal Jacket" on us? We're his family, Sam.


SAM

Look, man. Bigger fish, okay? I mean, we got a bunch of zombies about to turn this town into a giant chew toy.


DEAN

Yeah, and he's alone in the house making pie with one of 'em!


SAM

All right? So?


DEAN

So! I'm gonna have to go back there and… and… and kill her. That's the only thing I can think of.


SAM

If he sees you, you're a dead man.


DEAN

Well, then, I guess I won't let him see me.


SAM

Okay. I'll... head to town and rescue everyone – should be easy.


DEAN

Sounds like.


SAM

I'm gonna need some help.


DEAN

What about the sheriff?


SAM

Uh, last time I checked, the sheriff was pretty pro-zombie.


DEAN

Well, I guess you'll just have to convince her.


SAM

How?


DEAN

I don't know. You're just gonna.


INT. SHERIFF MILLS’ HOUSE – NIGHT


(Sheriff Mills’ young son is lying on the couch, obviously sick.)


SHERIFF MILLS

There. Does that feel better, honey?


SHERIFF MILLS’ SON

I'm so hungry, mommy.


SHERIFF MILLS

Oh, I know. I know. Mommy's gonna make you some soup, okay?


SHERIFF MILLS’ SON

Okay.


SHERIFF MILLS’ HUSBAND (talking on phone)

I don't know what else to tell you, doc. We checked the thermometer three times. His temperature is 111 degrees.


SHERIFF MILLS’ SON

Mommy.


SHERIFF MILLS’ HUSBAND

Hold on, doc. (He hands the phone to Sheriff Mills.)


SHERIFF MILLS’ SON

I'm hungry!


SHERIFF MILLS

Can you take that in to him?


SHERIFF MILLS (on phone)

Dr. Dwight, it's Jody Mills.


EXT. BOBBY’S SALVAGE YARD – NIGHT


(Dean walks toward the house, loading a shotgun.)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT


BOBBY

Karen, stay away from the windows. Karen?


(Karen collapses in the kitchen.)


BOBBY

Karen?! Karen?


KAREN

(coughing) I'm… I'm okay.


BOBBY

Yeah?


KAREN

I'm okay. I just... I'm okay. I – I just got to be dizzy.


BOBBY

You're burning up.


KAREN

Oh, I'm okay. I – I just need something to eat. And I'll be fine. Really. (She coughs heavily.)


INT. SHERIFF MILLS’ HOUSE – NIGHT


SHERIFF MILLS (on phone)

I don't know how to explain it, doctor. That's… that's why we're calling you. I...


(A noise comes from the living room and Sheriff Mills drops the phone.)


SHERIFF MILLS

Sean? Owen?


(She finds her husband dead and her son eating his flesh.)


SHERIFF MILLS

Oh, my God.


(Sheriff Mills’ son stands up and slowly approaches her. Sam suddenly bursts in and pulls her outside.)


SAM

Let's go!


SHERIFF MILLS

No!


SAM

Go!


EXT. SHERIFF MILLS’ HOUSE – NIGHT


SHERIFF MILLS

My husband!


SAM

Leave it! He's dead!


SHERIFF MILLS

That was not my son!


SAM

You're right. It wasn't. Listen, Sheriff. Your town is in danger. People are in danger, and we need to help them now. Can you do that for me? (Sheriff Mills shakes her head.) Can you focus for me, Sheriff? Sheriff?


SHERIFF MILLS

How do we put them down?


SAM

Head shot.


SHERIFF MILLS

(nods) We're gonna need weapons.


SAM

We can start by rounding up everybody we can find. Where is there a safe place we can take people?


SHERIFF MILLS

Jail.


SAM

Right. Just, um... (he takes out his gun) give me a minute.


(Sam goes back into the house. A gunshot is heard.)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT


(Karen lies in bed, sick. Bobby is at her bedside, holding her hand.)


KAREN

I'm so hungry, Bobby.


BOBBY

I'll fix you something to eat in a minute.


KAREN

I can feel it. It's happening.


BOBBY

Shh, it’s gonna be alright.


KAREN

No. It's not. I'm turning, Bobby. You know I am.


(Bobby looks at his gun on a table nearby.)


KAREN

It's okay. Do it.


BOBBY

No way.


KAREN

Please.


BOBBY

No.


KAREN

I remember.


BOBBY

You remember what?


KAREN

Everything. The demon inside me. You killing me. I remember.


BOBBY

Then you know... why I can't do it again.


KAREN

I remember something else, too. When I came back... There was a man.


BOBBY

What do you mean, a man?


KAREN

At the grave. He was so thin. Like a skeleton. And he told me to give you a message.


BOBBY

Me? W-why didn't you tell me this before?


KAREN

You've seen so much. I just... I just wanted to see you smile.


BOBBY

What was the message?


(Dean opens the front door and enters. A gunshot is heard.)


DEAN

Bobby?!


(Dean finds Karen dead and Bobby holding her hand.)


INT. POLICE STATION – NIGHT


(Sheriff Mills is taking guns out of a cabinet. A group of people is gathered in the room.)


SAM

All right, if I hand you a gun and you see a dead person, I don't care if it's your friend, your neighbor, or your wife, you shoot for the head. That's the only way we survive.


MAN

Uh, you mind telling us who the hell you are?


SAM

Friend of Bobby Singer's.


MAN

Town drunk.


SAM

No, I – I thought... (nods at Digger) he was the town drunk.


MAN

Who told you that?


SAM

Bobby Singer…. Stay sharp. I'll watch the front door.


EXT. BOBBY’S SALVAGE YARD – NIGHT


DEAN

You know, Bobby, if you want to sit this one out...


BOBBY

Let's just get going.


(A noise indicates someone is approaching and Dean goes to investigate.)


INT. POLICE STATION – NIGHT


(Sam opens the door and looks out, then closes the door again and shakes his head at Sheriff Mills.)


EXT. BOBBY’S SALVAGE YARD – NIGHT


(Dean walks through the salvage yard while Bobby sits in his wheelchair.)


BOBBY

Dean? Dean!


(Bobby fires at a zombie, which tackles Dean to the ground.)


ACT FOUR
EXT. BOBBY’S SALVAGE YARD – NIGHT


(Dean punches the zombie and tries to reach his gun.)


BOBBY

Dean?


(Bobby shoots at and kills a zombie as it runs at him, then shoots at another zombie which is moving behind cars. Dean finally gets to his gun and shoots the zombie that attacked him.)


BOBBY

Dean!


(Multiple zombies attack both Dean and Bobby. One of them throws Bobby out of his wheelchair onto the ground. Dean shoots it.)


BOBBY

Little help here? (Dean helps Bobby back into his wheelchair and picks up his gun.)


DEAN

Guns?


BOBBY

Yeah. All right.


(Dean and Bobby shoot zombies as they hurry back into the house.)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN

Got any more ammo? I'm low.


BOBBY

Yeah, we got plenty. Just run back past the zombies. It's in the van, where we left it.


DEAN

A simple "no" would have been fine. What are they all doing here, anyway?!


BOBBY

I think I get it.


DEAN

What?


(Zombies begin to break in through the roof and windows.)


BOBBY

Oh, that ain't good.


DEAN

I'm out.


BOBBY

Me too.


DEAN Come on!


(Dean and Bobby lock themselves in a closet, fighting zombies on the way. Zombies pound on the door.)


BOBBY

Kind of a tight fit, don't you think?


DEAN

It's all right. They're idiots. They can't pick a lock.


(The pounding stops and the door handle moves.)


BOBBY

Don't you ever get tired of being wrong?


DEAN

I'm making this stuff up as I go. Sue me.


(The closet door opens and Dean hits zombies with the butt of his shotgun.)


SAM

Get down!


(Sam and Sheriff Mills shoot all the zombies.)


SAM

Are you okay?


ACT FIVE
EXT. CEMETERY – DAY


(Dean and Sheriff Mills join Sam in front of a massive funeral pyre.)


DEAN

Well, if there's any zombies left out there, we can't find them.


SAM

How are the townspeople?


SHERIFF MILLS

Pretty freaked out. Hell, traumatized. A few of them are calling the papers. As far as I can tell, nobody's believed 'em yet.


SAM

Would you? (Sheriff Mills shakes her head.) How are you holding up?


DEAN

Is that everyone?


SAM

All but one.


EXT. BOBBY’S SALVAGE YARD – DAY


(Sam and Dean join Bobby in front of another funeral pyre.)


BOBBY

So, thinking maybe I should apologize for losing my head back there.


SAM

Bobby, you don't owe us anything.


DEAN

Hey, look, I don't know squat from shinola about love, but... At least you got to spend five days with her, right?


BOBBY

Right. Which makes things about a thousand times worse. She was the love of my life. How many times do I got to kill her?


SAM

Are you gonna be okay, Bobby?


BOBBY

You boys should know... Karen told me why Death was here.


SAM

What do you mean?


BOBBY

I know why he took a stroll through a cemetery in the sticks of South Dakota. He came for me.


DEAN

What do you mean, you?


BOBBY

Death came for me. He brought Karen back to send me a message.


DEAN

You? Why you?


BOBBY

Because I've been helping you, you sons of bitches. I'm one of the reasons you're still saying no to Lucifer, Sam.


DEAN

So this was like a hit on your life?


BOBBY

I don't know if they wanted to take my life or... my spirit. Either way, they wanted me out of the way.


SAM

But you're gonna be all right. Right, Bobby?
