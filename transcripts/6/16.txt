EXT. GAS STATION

(a trucker, Rick fills up his truck at the gas pump. Eve approaches him)

RICK Whoa.

EVE I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

RICK (camera pans down to show Eve's bare feet) You okay? You look a little—

EVE Well, I could use a ride.

RICK Okay. 

INT. RICK'S TRUCK

RICK So, what's your name, sweetheart?

EVE Eve.

RICK Eve. I'm Rick. So, how far you going, Eve?

EVE However far you want. (Eve leans over and kisses Rick, who pulls back)

RICK Whoa, whoa. Eve. Look, you're very pretty, but this is not what's right for you. Trust me.

EVE Then what's right for me?

RICK (Rick hands her a 'Jesus Loves You' pamphlet) This emptiness you feel inside – it's really a hunger for him.

EVE You do know that Jesus was just a man.

RICK Sure, but he was also the son of God, sent here because he loves us.

EVE God doesn't care about you.

RICK Sure he does.

EVE Your father made you and then abandoned you, so you pray. You see signs where there's nothing. But truth is, your apocalypse came and went, and you didn't even notice. A mother would never abandon her children like he did. You'll see.

RICK See what?

EVE Can I tell you a secret? (Rick nods and Eve leans over and latches onto Rick's ear)

RICK Aah! Aah!

INT. RICK'S HOUSE

(Rick approaches his sleeping wife and beats her to death with a hammer)

RICK'S WIFE Aah!

ACT I
INT. BOBBY'S LIVING ROOM

BOBBY I've been getting blasts from hunters all week. (pointing at a map) Nest of vamps. Werewolf dance party. Shifters, six of them. Two hunters died taking them out. Ghouls, ghouls. Ghoul-wraith smorgasbord. 

DEAN Is it just me, or is that a straight kick-line down I-80?

BOBBY Exactly.

DEAN Looks to me like it's a Sherman march monster mash.

SAM Yeah, but where are they marching to?

(Bobby circles another point on the map)

SAM What is it?

BOBBY Guy bashes in his family's heads.

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM

RICK It's like I told the cops. I blacked out.

SAM Well, just tell us what you do remember.

RICK Driving my regular route, and then I-I woke up in my truck at work.

SAM And where's work?

RICK Starlight Cannery. I-I didn't remember how I got there...So I called home. When no one picked up. I-I went there, and I found...

BOBBY Anything unusual before you blacked out? Sights, smells, anything off the routine?

RICK No. Basic night. I was giving some kid from the truck stop a ride. She took off. I-I think she took off.

DEAN Anything else?

RICK I swear – I didn't mean to do it. I-I loved them.

INT. POLICE STATION

(Sam is typing rapidly on a computer keyboard)

DEAN So, demon possession or ghosts? I thought this was a monster thing.

SAM All right, here we go. (they view security camera footage of the night the trucker picked up the hitchhiker) Truck stop, night of the murders.

DEAN That's him. (In the video, Eve approaches) Hmm. Hello. (Sam pauses the camera while Eve is facing it and her face is grotesque) Freakish nightmare. What the hell is that? 

SAM Bobby?

BOBBY I've never seen that in my life. All those vamps and ghouls out on I-80 – maybe they're coming in for Mother's Day.

DEAN Um...Okay, well, if that is big mama – whatever she is, we got zero on ganking her. So what are we gonna do if we run into her? Throw salt and hope?

BOBBY No, we're gonna turn tail and run, because we're in over our heads.

DEAN I mean, we better get some real info on this bitch before we do run into her.

POLICE OFFICER Hey, let's go.

BOBBY What's the ruckus?

POLICE OFFICER A guy just went postal down at the Cannery.

BOBBY Okay, I'll go. You finish here.

EXT. DOCKS

BOBBY FBI. Willis. How many in there?

POLICE OFFICER Six dead.

BOBBY What happened?

POLICE OFFICER Apparently, a guy walks in, pulls a hunting rifle, just opens fire. Captain! This is Agent—

POLICE CAPTAIN What? There a fed convention in town or something?

BOBBY I beg your pardon.

RUFUS Agent Willis? Am I right?

BOBBY Agent. I wasn't expecting you...yet.

RUFUS Well, apparently, you didn't get the call. (to the officers) Gentlemen, can you excuse us?

BOBBY What in the high holy are you doing here, Rufus?

RUFUS Same as you – tracking 31 flavours of crazy, which led us both smack into the middle of this.

BOBBY Right. Huh. Can we talk to the perp?

RUFUS Well, we can give it a shot. I don't know if he's gonna talk back to us, though. Cops put eight bullets in him. So...

BOBBY So what?

RUFUS So are we partnering on this or not? Come on, man. It's not rocket surgery. We're here. Let's do this. Just like old times.

BOBBY Long as I get to drive.

RUFUS (laughing) Hell no.

INT. AUTOPSY ROOM

(Rufus and Bobby examine the corpse of the shooter)

RUFUS So, do you think the mother of whatever the hell is wrapped up in this, Bobby?

BOBBY Looks like.

RUFUS These are just guys going berserk, Bobby. How is that a monster thing?

BOBBY I don't know. That's why we're hacking him open. Hand me one of those swab things over there.

(Rufus hands Bobby a swab and Bobby checks the ear of the body, the swab comes out covered in blue grey goo)

RUFUS What have you got? That ecto? (Rufus takes the swab) That's not ecto. (Rufus sniffs the swab) What the hell is that?

BOBBY It's something new.

RUFUS New? No such thing as new, Bobby.

BOBBY Well, it's something. Those guys who snapped, one thing they had in common – they both worked at that Cannery joint.

EXT. CANNERY

RUFUS I don't even know why you have a driver's licence.

DEAN Well, look what the cat dragged in.

SAM It really is good to see you, Rufus.

RUFUS I can believe it. It must get old dealing with this miserable cuss here all by yourself.

SAM Is it that obvious?

BOBBY Why don't you three get a room?

DEAN All right, we all pack a snack?

SAM Yeah.

DEAN Let's see what we can see.

INT. CANNERY

(a door opens and Gwen steps out)

DEAN Gwen?

GWEN Dean.

(Samuel appears behind her, Dean walks toward Samuel, raising his gun)

DEAN Welcome to next time.

SAM (lowers Dean's arm) No, no, no, no! Hold on!

DEAN I said I'd kill him!

SAM Look, just a second.

RUFUS I take it you know each other.

DEAN He's our grandfather.

RUFUS Oh. Somebody needs a hug.

BOBBY Why are you here?

SAMUEL We're working. You?

DEAN None of your damn business!

BOBBY Sam, take Dean for a walk.

DEAN You got to be kidding me.

SAM Look, Dean, it's fine.

DEAN How?

(Sam walks Dean out of the room)

DEAN What is wrong with you?

SAM Look, maybe he knows something.

DEAN You don't remember what he did. I do.

SAM I know. I'm not saying don't. I'm saying not yet.

(Sam re-enters the room, Dean waits just outside)

BOBBY So...you're Samuel.

SAMUEL You must be the guy pretending to be their father.

BOBBY Well, somebody ought to.

SAMUEL Sam. You're looking well.

SAM Save the small talk, all right?

SAMUEL You seem different.

SAM I got my soul back. No thanks to you, I hear.

SAMUEL You hear? You don't remember.

SAM I remember enough.

RUFUS I, uh, really hate to break up this little circle of love, but why don't we talk shop, huh? How about you tell us what it is you're hunting?

SAMUEL A creature from Purgatory. She calls herself Eve.

SAM Eve?

SAMUEL Yep. They call her mother. She was here about 10,000 years ago. Every freak that walks the face of the earth can be traced back to her. And she's back.

BOBBY How the hell do you know all that?

SAMUEL You don't know half the things that I know, kid. Hell, until recently, you didn't even know about us.

BOBBY I now know that you'd throw your own kin to hungry ghouls. I think I know enough.

GWEN You what?

SAMUEL Dean lied to the man.

BOBBY How about you ask Dean?

GWEN Good idea. (Gwen exits the room and approaches Dean) Dean. Is it true?

DEAN What?

GWEN Did Samuel really try to—

DEAN Kill me? Yes. He didn't even blink. That's the guy you're rolling with.

GWEN He didn't tell me anything about that. I didn't know.

DEAN I know. Honestly, there's something I need to tell you.

GWEN What?

(Dean pulls out his gun and shoots Gwen in the heart)

(The others run out of the room at the sound of the gunshot. Sam checks for Gwen's pulse, and then gets back up to look for Dean.)

RUFUS See if you can plug that hole up, Bobby.

ACT II
(Rufus tries CPR chest compressions on Gwen, while Sam searches for Dean)

RUFUS Come on, girl! Come on! Come on! Come on!

BOBBY She's gone.

RUFUS Ah, damn it.

BOBBY I'm sorry...If you care.

SAMUEL Screw you. I care.

SAM Is she, uh...


RUFUS Where's Dean?

SAM I couldn't find him. Whatever got into those guys must have got into Dean.

BOBBY Rufus, help Samuel move her somewhere. Sam and I will lock down here. We're gonna want to find Dean before he finds us.

SAM We're gonna find him alive, Samuel, or I'm gonna put a bullet into your head.

(Sam and Bobby walk through the Cannery, locking doors. All four men search, Sam dials Dean's cell-phone and then hears it ring. Rufus spots Dean.)

RUFUS Dean, put that damn thing down. (Samuel runs over aiming his gun at Dean, Dean points his gun at Samuel) Dean, put it down.

DEAN You're the least of my worries right now, Rufus.

SAM Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

BOBBY Okay, both of you.

RUFUS Both of us, my ass.

DEAN I'm not in the mood. I just had a 12-inch...Herpe crawl out of my ear.

SAM What?

DEAN You heard me. I just woke up on the ground, just in time to see this – this...worm thing sliding out of my freaking ear and into that vent. So you tell me what the hell's going on!

SAMUEL You killed Gwen. That's what's going on.

DEAN We were just talking out in the hallway. That's the last thing I remember. That thing must have jumped me.

BOBBY So, we're talking about, like, a monster that gets in you?

DEAN It's like a Khan worm on steroids.

SAM You mean like a parasite, something that took over your body.

DEAN Worm crawls in you, worm crawls out.

RUFUS Monster possession? That's novel.

SAMUEL Or that thing's still in you, and we can't trust a word that you're saying.

DEAN It's not!

BOBBY Check your ear.

DEAN What do you mean, check my ear? Check my ear for what? (Rufus sticks his finger in Dean's ear) Hey! What? Why don't you buy me a drink first?

RUFUS Second date. Oh, yeah, we're goo positive.

DEAN What does that mean? What does that mean?

RUFUS That means it was in you, all right.

SAMUEL Or it still is.

DEAN It's not in me!

BOBBY Okay. Everybody, give up your guns.

SAMUEL What?

RUFUS Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, think about this for a second, Bobby.

BOBBY I'm thinking we don't know who is and who ain't got the damn Khan worm up inside his melon.

DEAN It's not in me!

BOBBY I didn't say it was. Point is we don't know who it is. It could be any one of us. So the best we can do...is to make it that much harder for that thing to blow our fool heads off. (Bobby holds open a sack and puts his gun inside.  Dean, Sam and Rufus follow)

RUFUS Are you waiting for a handwritten invite, Campbell? (Samuel reluctantly gives up his gun)

(They go back into the room and lock their weapons in a locker)

BOBBY Okay. We need some time to breathe, make a plan.

SAMUEL A plan? Based on?

BOBBY I'm gonna make a few phone calls, see if anybody ever heard of anything like this.

RUFUS Hmm. Ditto. Got a few trees I can shake.

BOBBY (on the phone) Oh, balls, Allard. No, I told you that.

RUFUS (flips his phone closed) Damn it.

(Samuel gets up. Sam blocks his path)

SAMUEL Relax. Bathroom break. So unless you want to hold it for me...

(Samuel leaves the room. Dean and Sam follow him)

BOBBY (flips his phone shut) Well, I got a dump truck full of bubkes.

RUFUS Nothing here, either. You call Willie?

BOBBY Of course. You think I'm an idjit?

RUFUS How about Raj?

BOBBY Wouldn't talk to me.

RUFUS Yeah, me neither.

BOBBY Okay, plan "B." Let's just go and grab the thing.

RUFUS And then what, exactly?

BOBBY Well, we sit on our thumbs, or we go in guns blazing.

RUFUS Like Omaha?

BOBBY You know what? Screw you for bringing up Omaha. That's just low.

(Samuel comes around a row of lockers and finds Dean and Sam waiting for him)

SAMUEL What?

DEAN Nothing. I'm just wondering how you sleep at night.

SAMUEL Like a baby. Thanks for asking.

DEAN You fed us to Crowley.

SAMUEL True, but what am I gonna do about it now? Do I blame you for wanting to kill me? Of course not, Dean. What I did was...but I'm not apologizing. I did what I did. I don't cry over spilled blood.

SAM So you really can just go on, like...

SAMUEL Just because you're Dr. Jekyll at the moment doesn't mean you can get all high and mighty. Don't forget, we spent a year together.

SAM Yeah, we did. We're blood. And you still sold me out.

SAMUEL Trust me, what I did pales in comparison to what you did, and on more than one occasion.

SAM All right, tell me what I did.

DEAN No. Sam, come on. (Dean goes to stand between Sam and Samuel)

DEAN The only reason you're alive right now is because we're working a job. The minute we kill this thing...you're next.

SAMUEL Okay, then. We'll just see. (Dean sees goo coming from Samuel's ear, Samuel pulls his gun, Dean grabs his arm and angles it up. Samuel fires but the shot misses. He shoves Sam and Dean against the lockers and runs)

BOBBY I heard a shot.

DEAN Samuel!

RUFUS I'm gonna be needing my gun back now, Bobby.

BOBBY You think?

RUFUS Yeah.

(Bobby breaks the lock on the locker holding their weapons)

RUFUS Hey, don't feel bad. You know, it was a good plan, except for the part where a monster would definitely, definitely not give up all his weapons.

BOBBY Shut up.

(Dean and Sam enter the room)

DEAN We lost him.

SAM So, what's the plan?

DEAN We stick together. We got to keep track of this thing, who it's in.

(They search the cannery. Suddenly Sam grabs Dean and pulls him back. Dean, Bobby and Rufus point their guns at Sam)

SAM Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on. Look. (Sam shines his flashlight down revealing a wire line)

DEAN Booby trap.

BOBBY I'll be damned.

(They step over the trap carefully and continue. Suddenly a door slides closed behind Sam and he is cut off from the rest of the group)

DEAN Hey! Hey! 

SAM Whoa! Dean!

DEAN Sam! Damn it. Son of a bitch.

SAM Dean?

DEAN Sam!

SAM I'm gonna go around, okay?

DEAN All right. Watch yourself.

SAM Yeah.

DEAN Come on.

SAM (spots Samuel and aims his gun at him) Don't move.

SAMUEL Sam.

SAM Put your gun down.

SAMUEL What you gonna do, son? You're not gonna shoot me. You got your soul back. You gonna shoot your own family?

SAM Yeah, I wouldn't go with the family thing. Try again.

SAMUEL Mary's still my daughter. (steps closer)

SAM I said don't move.

SAMUEL You're still named after me. (steps closer)

SAM I said don't move!

SAMUEL Appears to be our moment, Sam. You still want to know about your summer vacation? I'll tell you all about it. You're dying to know, huh?

SAM Yeah, I am.

SAMUEL Well, then, let's just put these down and talk. (steps closer)

SAM Stop.

SAMUEL It's all right, Sam. (steps closer)

(Sam shoots Samuel in the head)

ACT III
DEAN Sam! Sam.

BOBBY Oh, thank God. (Notices Samual's dead body) Drop the gun, Sam.

(Sam puts his gun down)

SAM It's me.

RUFUS Okay. That's great, Sam. Just got to cuff you, uh, till we can be sure, okay? You understand, right?

SAM It's in him. (Sam gestures at Samuel)

BOBBY Are you sure?

SAM Yeah. Yeah, I think.

RUFUS You see anything come out of him...after he dropped?

(they take Samuel back into the room and swab his ears)

DEAN Tell me you got something.

BOBBY Nothing.

SAM What? So – so you mean he wasn't a monster when I ganked him?

RUFUS One way to find out. Bobby, you got a cranial saw in the car?

BOBBY Of course.

DEAN You're not going alone.

RUFUS Oh, no, he won't. He won't. We will both go grab some tools and see about getting some power in this place. And I want you and you to – okay, I want you and you to watch him and him and – all right, if anything crawls out of anybody, somebody step on it.

SAM Yeah, don't worry. I'll watch Samuel. Dean will watch me.

RUFUS Yeah, right.

(Rufus and Bobby exit the room)

DEAN You did the right thing, you know.

SAM You mean you think I did, if it's in him and I'm me. This thing's playing three-card monte with us.

DEAN Well, I'm just gonna assume you're you.

SAM You want to take this off, then? (Sam motions with his bound wrists)

DEAN Not till we get that sucker out of his walnut.

SAM I don't know. I mean, I barely remember him, and what I do remember – it's not good. And what he did to us...But...

DEAN There's a "but"?

SAM I mean, I just can't help but think...What would Mom say?

DEAN You know what I think Mom would say? She'd say just 'cause you're blood doesn't make you family. You got to earn that.

(The lights come on and Rufus and Bobby enter)

RUFUS Well...All right. Let's play operation.

BOBBY You boys want to take a breather?

DEAN We're good.

BOBBY We're about to crack open your grandpa's grapefruit. Take a breather.

(Dean and Sam exit)

RUFUS (looking at the frayed cable of the cranial saw) What is this? Have you been dumpster-diving again?

BOBBY What? It still works.

RUFUS Yeah, right. Hope so. 

BOBBY Listen, Rufus, I've been thinking.

RUFUS Yeah, well wonders never cease. (Rufus plugs in the saw)

BOBBY Yeah, s-shut up a minute. I'm trying to say something. It was my fault – Omaha.

RUFUS No. No, it wasn't.

BOBBY No, I should – I should have listened to you.

RUFUS Well, hey, that's categorical, Bobby.

BOBBY I – l-let me just get this out.

RUFUS Bobby, we've had this conversation already, okay?

BOBBY No, we haven't. I never said I'm sorry, Rufus. I – you lost her because of me, and I—

RUFUS Bobby, I said we've had this conversation already. And you could blabber all day...And it wouldn't change a thing, Bobby. I will never forgive you for what happened. You got that? Never. So change the subject, Bob.

(They begin sawing Samuel's head, and his eyes open! He fights Rufus and Bobby and throws them both off of him. He breaks off a table leg and shoves it through the door handles)

SAM Dean.

RUFUS Jesus.

(Dean frees Sam's hands. Bobby throws Samuel against the frayed cable and Samuel is electrocuted. The Khan worm leaves Samuel. Dean and Sam kick the door open)

SAM Bobby, you okay?

DEAN Rufus. Rufus. Rufus. Hey, you all right? Wake up.

SAM Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's all right. I got you. Come on. (he helps Bobby up)

DEAN Come on. (he helps Rufus up)

RUFUS This can't be my afterlife 'cause the three of you are here. What happened?

SAM Well, when we left, he was dead on the table.

BOBBY Yeah, till he wasn't.

RUFUS So how did he get double dead?

DEAN Bobby threw him against that. I guess it was a live wire. It shorted, and he went ape. Then that thing crawled out of his ear.

BOBBY At least we know what tickles it. Electricity.

SAM Yeah. Now the question is, where'd it go? You see?

DEAN No.

SAM You two were down for the count.

DEAN Yeah. Well, either it bailed or it's in either one of you.

RUFUS Or, it's in one of you.

DEAN No, we were awake.

RUFUS Did you have eyes on each other?

DEAN Yes.

RUFUS 100% of the time?

DEAN Define 100.

RUFUS Like I said.

SAM All right, how about, uh, check for goo, right?

(all four stick their fingers in their ears)

SAM Nothing.

BOBBY It might just be gone.

DEAN No. It might have wised up and covered its trail.

SAM All right, let's settle this...100%.

DEAN How? (Sam strips the cable, Dean plugs it in) You're live.

SAM Okay. All right. (Sam holds the cable against Samuel) Yeah.

RUFUS Okay. I'm not a doctor, but I'm gonna go ahead and call this one.

SAM Yeah. All right,who wants to go first?

DEAN Come on. (removes his jacket)

SAM You sure?

DEAN Hurry up before I start thinking – (Sam holds the cable against Dean's arm) Son of a...Whew. Awesome. Here, you want me to—

(Sam holds the cable against his own arm) 

DEAN (gesturing for Sam to hand him the cable) Let's go.

SAM Yep.

RUFUS Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

DEAN No passes, Rufus. Come on.

RUFUS I got a damn pacemaker.

DEAN Well, you better hope it's a good one.

BOBBY Since when do you got a pacemaker?

RUFUS Since Bush Jr., term one. I'm down three toes, too, F.Y.I. All right, come on. Just make it quick.

RUFUS (as Dean holds the cable against his arm) God! God! Damn it! Damn it!

DEAN You okay?

RUFUS No, I'm not okay. Give me that. (he grabs the cable from Dean)

BOBBY Okay. All right, my turn. Well, it ain't inside me, so go right ahead.

RUFUS All right, then just stand still, Bobby.

BOBBY Okay, sure.

RUFUS I'll make this quick.

BOBBY No problem.

RUFUS All right? Let's do this.

BOBBY Okay, uh, just a second, Rufus.

RUFUS Just a second nothing, whatever you are.

BOBBY I'm Bobby.

RUFUS Bobby, my ass.

(Bobby stabs Rufus in the chest)

SAM Bobby! (Rufus falls and Sam lowers him to the ground) Rufus.

FINAL ACT
INT. CANNERY (Sam and Dean stand on either side of Bobby)

SAM Bobby, there are two of us and one of you.

(Sam catches a hold of Bobby and Dean punches him, knocking him unconscious. Bobby wakes tied to a chair with duct tape)

DEAN Well, hey, there, you little herpe. (Dean holds the cable against Bobby's neck)

SAM Why do you keep talking about herpes?

DEAN What? I don't. Shut up. Shut up. (to Bobby) Now, don't you even think about shagging ass out of here, 'cause we got every crack in this room sealed. So get comfy.

BOBBY I am comfy. It's nice in here. And you love this guy, don'tcha? You really want to kill me and take him with me? Haven't you lost enough pals today?

DEAN We'll do what we have to do. And we got some questions for you, so you can either play ball, or we could fry up a little shrimp on the barbie.

BOBBY Ask. Been waiting for you to ask.

DEAN What the hell's that supposed to mean?

BOBBY It means I got nothing to hide.

SAM What are you?

BOBBY You haven't got a name for me yet. I'm new around here. Eve cooked me up herself. (Dean holds the cable to Bobby's neck again)

DEAN Who is she, this Eve bitch?

BOBBY The mother of all of us, and the end of all of you. By the time she's done, there'll be more creatures than humans. You'll live in pens. We'll serve up your young and call it veal.

SAM And what's your deal in all of this? I mean, how's jumping a few truckers gonna help?

BOBBY You think I'm here to mess with a couple of Cannery workers? We led you here.

SAM Why?

BOBBY She has a message for you.

DEAN Oh, yeah? What's that?

BOBBY You're all gonna die. She's pissed. She's here. And it's gonna be nothing but pain for you from here on in.

DEAN Well, here's my response. (Dean holds the cable to Bobby's neck again)

SAM Dean. Dean! How much more do you think he can take?

BOBBY You can't kill me, not without taking him with me.

DEAN Well...We'll just have to do what Bobby would want us to do. (Sam wraps Bobby's mouth and ears shut with duct tape)

DEAN No way out now, slug-o. Bobby, hang on in there. (Dean holds the cable to Bobby's neck until he sags forward)

DEAN Bobby?

SAM Is he, uh...Hey, hey. (Sam starts to peel off the duct tape, the Khan worm falls out, dead) Whoa. Bobby.

DEAN Bobby, hey.

SAM He's not breathing. Bobby!

EXT. CEMETERY

DEAN I got to say, I never figured Rufus for the religious type.

BOBBY Well, he didn't exactly keep kosher. He always used to pull the old "can't work on the sabbath" card whenever we had to bury a body. You know, I-I was just a job. I was Joe mechanic. Then my wife got possessed...went nuts on me. I stabbed her, and that didn't stop her. Next thing I knew, this guy comes busting in, soaks her with holy water, and sends that demon straight to hell so fast. I'd have gone away for killing her. But... Rufus cleaned up everything. Taught me a thing or two about...what's really out there. Pretty soon, we were riding together. Worked like that for years, kind of like you two knuckleheads.

SAM So, what happened?

BOBBY It was Omaha. It was my fault. And he never let it go.

DEAN Well, he should have.

BOBBY You don't know what I did, Dean.

DEAN Doesn't matter.

BOBBY What do you mean, it doesn't—

DEAN I mean at the end of the day, you two are family. Life's short, and ours are shorter than most. We're gonna spend it wringing our hands? Something's gonna get us eventually, and when my guts get ripped out, just so you two know, we're good. Blanket apology for all the crap that anybody's done all the way around.

SAM Some of us pulled a lot of crap, Dean.

DEAN Well, clean slate.

SAM Okay.

(Bobby takes out a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue and pours some on the grave, and then takes a swig himself)
