TEASER
INT. CLINIC - NIGHT

In slow motion, we see DEAN in a dim hallway, grimly turning towards a door and pulling out a gun. He slides out the clip, taps it on the gun, then replaces it. Inside the room, there is a Crater Lake poster on the wall. Below it is a young blond man (DUANE) tied to a chair. Nearby are a young woman (PAM), a middle-aged woman (DR. LEE), and a tough-looking black man (MARK). DUANE looks up as DEAN opens the door and enters, raising the gun. At regular speed, DUANE begins babbling.

DUANE
No, no, no, no, no, you're not gonna... no, I swear! It's not in me!

PAM
Oh God. We're all gonna die.

MARK
Maybe he's tellin' the truth.

DEAN
(advancing, cocking the gun)
He's not him, not anymore.

DUANE
No, stop it! Stop it! Ask her, ask the doctor! It's not in me!

DR. LEE
I just . . . I can't tell.

DUANE
No, please, don't. Don't. I swear, I,

DEAN
I got no choice.

DUANE
(sobbing)
I swear, it's not in me, it's not in me! Don't, don't. Please!

DEAN fires twice. The image distorts in a bright flash, and we close on...

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

SAM, who is lying on the floor beside a motel bed and coming out of the vision. The door opens and DEAN enters, chewing on jerky and carrying a six-pack of beer. SAM sits up, panting.

DEAN
Sam?

SAM
No . . .

SUPERNATURAL

ACT ONE
EXT. BLACKTOP - NIGHT

DEAN is driving, SAM navigating with a GPS device which speaks directions.

GPS VOICE
Continue on O-R Two-Two-Four West.

SAM
There are only two towns in the US named Rivergrove.

DEAN
How come you're so sure it's the one in Oregon?

SAM has a flashback to the vision — the Oregon poster on the wall.

SAM
There was a picture. Crater Lake.

DEAN
Okay, what else?

SAM
I saw a dark room, some people, and a guy tied to a chair.

DEAN
And I ventilated him?

SAM
Yeah. You thought there was something inside him.

DEAN
What, a demon? Was he possessed?

SAM
I don't know.

DEAN
Well, all your weirdo visions are always tied to the Yellow-Eyed Demon somehow . . . so was there any black smoke? Did we try to exorcise it?

SAM
No. Nothing, you just plugged him, that's it.

DEAN
Well, I'm sure I had a good reason.

SAM
I sure hope so.

DEAN
What does that mean?
(beat)
I mean, I'm not gonna waste an innocent man.
(SAM raises his eyebrows)
I wouldn't!

SAM
I never said you would!

DEAN
Fine!

SAM
Fine! Look, we don't know what it is. But whatever it is, that guy in the chair's a part of it. So let's find him, and see what's what.

DEAN
Fine.

SAM
Fine.



EXT. RIVERGROVE STREET - DAY

The Winchesters pull into town past a large billboard advertising Crater Lake. They pull up in front of a wooden shop; out front the older man from the vision (MARK) is cleaning a rifle; he wears a short-sleeved blue shirt with a multi-pocket brown vest. SAM and DEAN get out and approach him.

DEAN
Morning.

MARK
Good morning. Can I help you?

DEAN
Yeah.
(pulling out a badge)
Uh, Billy Gibbons, Frank Beard. U.S. Marshals.

MARK
What's this about?

DEAN
We're looking for someone.

SAM
A young man, early twenties.
(he flashes to the vision)
He'd have a, a thin scar right below his hairline.

MARK
What'd he do?

SAM
Well, nothing. We're actually looking for someone else, but we think this young man could help us.

DEAN
Yeah, he's not in any kind of trouble or anything; well, not yet.
(he glances down at MARK'S left arm, which shows a distinctive tattoo)
I think maybe you know who he is . . . Master Sergeant.
(smiling)
My dad was in the Corps, he was a Corporal.

MARK
What company?

DEAN
Echo-2-1.

SAM
So can you help us?

MARK
(hesitates)
Duane Tanner's got a scar like that. But I know him. Good kid, keeps his nose clean.

DEAN
Oh, I'm sure he does. Um. You know where he lives?

MARK
With his family, up Aspen Way.

DEAN
Thank you.

They leave; MARK frowns as he watches them go. Across the street, SAM bumps into a telephone pole and glances at it in passing. He stops; carved into the wood is a single word:

CROATOAN

They approach the pole and SAM points at the word with a significant look.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN
Croatoan?

SAM
Yeah.
(DEAN looks at him blankly.)
Roanoke? Lost colony? Ring a bell? Dean, did you pay any attention in history class?

DEAN
Yeah! Shots heard 'round the world, How bills becomes laws . . .

SAM
That's not school, that's Schoolhouse Rock.

DEAN
Whatever.

SAM
Roanoke was one of the first English colonies in America, late 1500s?

DEAN
Oh yeah, yeah, I do remember that. The only thing they left behind was a single word carved in a tree. Croatoan.

SAM
Yeah. And I mean, there were theories — Indian raid, disease, but nobody knows what really happened. They were all just gone. I mean, wiped out overnight.

DEAN
You don't think that's what's going on here, I mean . . .

SAM
Whatever I saw in my head, it sure wasn't good. But what do you think could do that?

DEAN
Well, I mean, like I said, all of your weirdo visions are always tied to the Yellow-Eyed Demon somehow, so . . .

SAM
We should get help. Bobby, uh, Ellen maybe?

DEAN
Yeah, that's a good idea.

DEAN pulls out his cell phone, then frowns at it.

DEAN
I don't have a signal.

SAM does the same, shakes his head.

SAM
I don't either.

They walk to a pay phone, which DEAN picks up; we hear the "out of service" beeping, and DEAN clicks the receiver several times.

DEAN
Line's dead.
(he hangs up)
I'll tell you one thing. If I was gonna massacre a town, that'd be my first step.



EXT. TANNER HOUSE - DAY

The IMPALA is parked outside a cabin--like house in the middle of nowhere, and SAM and DEAN approach the front. By the door is a small, tacky plaque that reads "BORN TO FISH; FORCED TO WORK". SAM knocks on the door, and a teenaged boy with dark spiked hair (JAKE) opens it.

JAKE
Yeah?

DEAN
(flashing the badge)
We're looking for Duane Tanner; he lives here, right?

JAKE
Yeah, he's my brother.

DEAN
Can we talk to him?

JAKE
Oh, he's not here right now.

DEAN
Do you know where he is?

JAKE
Yeah, he went on a fishing trip up by Roslyn Lake.

SAM
Your parents home?

JAKE
Yeah, they're inside.

MR. TANNER (inside)
Jake? Who is it?

DEAN
(as MR. TANNER appears)
Hi, U.S. Marshals, sir, we're looking for your son Duane.

MR. TANNER
Wh-why? He's not in trouble, is he?

DEAN
No, no, no, no. We just need to ask him a couple of routine questions, that's all.

SAM
When's he due back from his trip?

MR. TANNER
I'm not sure.

SAM
Well, maybe your wife knows.

MR. TANNER
No, I don't know, she's not here right now.

DEAN
Your son said she was.

JAKE
Did I?

MR. TANNER
She's getting groceries. So, when Duane gets back, there's a number where he can get a hold of you?

DEAN
Oh no, we'll just check in with you later.

They turn and walk down the steps as the TANNERS shut the door behind them.

DEAN
That was kind of creepy, right? A little too Stepford?

SAM
Big time.

Looking furtively about, they sneak around to the back of the house, crouching below a window. Cut to:


INT. TANNER HOUSE - DAY

BEVERLY TANNER is tied to a chair and gagged; JAKE comes around behind her, hands on her shoulders.

JAKE
It's okay, Mom. It's not gonna hurt.

MR. TANNER comes out of the next room with a kitchen knife. JAKE stands in front of his mother and casually rolls up one sleeve; his father cuts into his arm and lets the blood drip onto a wound in BEVERLY'S shoulder.

OUTSIDE, SAM and DEAN arm themselves and kick down the back door. As they rush in, handguns raised, MR. TANNER rushes at them with a knife; DEAN shoots him thrice in the chest. JAKE jumps out the window, shattering glass, and darts off into the woods. SAM aims at him through the window but hesitates, giving him time to get away.

END ACT ONE


ACT TWO
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

BEVERLY is in the back seat of the IMPALA; as they pull up in front of the clinic SAM helps her out and leads her to the door. DEAN opens the trunk and looks around furtively.


INT. CLINIC - DAY

SAM leads BEVERLY inside; the clinic is quiet, dim, and empty.

SAM
Hello? Hello? We need a doctor here!

The young woman from the vision (PAM) rushes out, concerned.

PAM
Mrs. Tanner, what happened?

SAM
She's been attacked.

PAM
Doctor Lee?

DR. LEE
(rushing in)
Bring her in.

SAM
Okay.

PAM leads SAM and BEVERLY into a back room, and DR. LEE follows. DEAN enters, carrying the (canvas-covered) body of MR. TANNER hoisted over his shoulders.

DR. LEE
Is that —

DEAN
Mr. Tanner?

DR. LEE
Was he attacked too?

DEAN
Uh . . . no, actually, he did the attacking and then he got himself shot.

DR. LEE
Shot?

DEAN
Yeah.

DR. LEE
And who are you?

DEAN
U.S. Marshal. I'd show you my badge, but uh . . .

DR. LEE
Oh. Sorry. Bring him back here.



INT. LAB - DAY
BEVERLY is seated on a stool with her shirt off; DR. LEE sits across from her, treating the wound on her left shoulder.

DR. LEE
Wait, you said Jake helped him? Your son Jake?

BEVERLY
(nodding)
They beat me. Tied me up.

PAM
I don't believe it.

DR. LEE
Pam. Beverly . . . do you have any idea why they would act this way? Any history of chemical dependency?

BEVERLY
No, of course not. I don't know why. One minute they were my husband and my son. And the next, they had the devil in them.

SAM and DEAN are listening to this, and they share a look at her last words.

DEAN
We gotta talk.
(they exit the lab)
Those guys were whacked out of their gourds.

SAM
What do you think? Multiple demons, mass possession?

DEAN
If it is a possession there could be more. I mean, God knows how many, it could be like a friggin' Shriner convention.

SAM
Great.

DEAN
Of course, that's one way to wipe out a town, you take it from the inside.

SAM
I don't know, man. We didn't see any of the demon smoke with Mr. Tanner, or any of the other usual signs.

DEAN
Well, whatever. Something turned him into a monster. And you know if you woulda taken out the other one there'd be one less to worry about.

SAM
I'm sorry, all right? I hesitated, Dean, it was a kid!

DEAN
No, it was an "it". Not the best time for a bleeding heart, Sam.

DR. LEE stalks out of the lab, her heels clicking loudly on the floor.

SAM
How's the patient?

DR. LEE
Terrible! What the hell happened out there?

DEAN
We don't know.

DR. LEE
Yeah? Well, you just killed my next door neighbor.

DEAN
We didn't have a choice.

DR. LEE
Maybe so, but we need the county Sheriff. I need the coroner . . .

SAM
Phones are down.

DR. LEE
I know, I tried. Tell me you have a police radio in the car?

SAM
Yeah we do. But it crapped out just like everything else.

DR. LEE
I don't understand what is happening.

DEAN
How far is it to the next town?

DR. LEE
It's about forty miles down to Sidewinder.

DEAN
All right, I'm gonna go down there, see if I can find some help.
(clapping SAM on the shoulder)
My partner'll stick around, keep you guys safe.

DR. LEE
Safe from what?

DEAN
We'll get back to you on that.



EXT. BLACKTOP - DAY

DEAN pulls up behind a wrecked car with Oregon plates that read "WTF 4C7"; he stops to investigate, carrying a gun. The windows on the car are smashed and blood covers the seats; on the ground by the driver's side is a large bloody knife. He picks it up.



INT. CLINIC - DAY

SAM is leaning against a counter, staring at the body of MR. TANNER. He begins pacing; DR. LEE is nearby, looking at something in a microscope.

DR. LEE
Huh.

SAM
What?

DR. LEE
His lymphocyte percentage is pretty high. His body was fighting off a viral infection.

SAM
Really? What kind of virus?

DR. LEE
Can't say for sure.

SAM
Do you think an infection could have made him act like that?

DR. LEE
None that I've ever heard of. I mean, some can cause dementia, but not that kind of violence. And besides, I've never heard of one that did this to the blood.

SAM
Did what?

DR. LEE
There's this . . . weird residue. If I didn't know better I'd say it was sulfur.

SAM
Sulfur.



EXT. BLACKTOP - DAY

DEAN drives along the road to a bridge, which is blocked by a roadblock consisting of several cars and a half-dozen locals with guns. One is JAKE. He stops the car, frowning. Something bangs down on the roof of the car and he jumps; a man leans over into frame.

DEAN
Oh-ho-ho. Hey.

MAN
Sorry. Road's closed.

DEAN
Yeah, I can see that. What's up?

MAN
Quarantine.

DEAN
Quarantine? What is it?

MAN
Don't know. Something going around out there.

DEAN
Uh-huh. Who told you that?

MAN
County Sheriff.

DEAN
Is he here?

MAN
No. He called. Say, why don't you get out of the car and we'll talk a little?

DEAN
(laughs nervously)
Well, you are a handsome devil, but I don't swing that way, sorry.

MAN
I'd sure appreciate it if you got out of the car, just for a quick minute.

DEAN
Yeah, I'll bet you would.

DEAN puts the car into a quick reverse; the MAN grabs his collar and is dragged along. The men at the roadblock begin firing, and DEAN swings the car around, shaking the MAN off and zooming away.



INT. CLINIC - DAY

SAM is staring intently at BEVERLY, still huddled on the stool in the lab.

BEVERLY
I don't understand. Are you saying my husband and Jake had a disease?

DR. LEE
That's what we're trying to find out. Now, during the attack, do you remember . . . did you have any direct contact with their blood?

BEVERLY
Oh my God. You don't think I've got this virus, do you?

DR. LEE
Beverly, I don't know what to think. But with your permission, we'll take a blood sample.

BEVERLY nods and lays her hand gently on DR. LEE'S. Suddenly she grabs DR. LEE'S wrist and yells in rage, lashing out with her other hand. SAM advances on her and she tosses him against a glass cabinet, which shatters. She picks up a scalpel as he takes a fire extinguisher from the wall; she advances on him, still yelling. He knocks her out.



EXT. TOWN ROAD - DAY

DEAN is driving back into town; MARK steps into his path brandishing a rifle, and he stops the car.

MARK
Hands where I can see 'em!

DEAN
Son of a-

MARK
Get out of the car! Out of the car!

DEAN
(opening the door and getting out slowly)
All right, easy there, big guy.

As he stands, DEAN pulls out a handgun and points it at MARK.

DEAN
All right, put it down!

MARK
Lower it now!

DEAN
Put it down!

MARK
Are you one of 'em?

DEAN
No! Are you?

MARK
No!

DEAN
You could be lying!

MARK
So could you!

DEAN
All right! All right. We could do this all day, all right? Let's just uh, let's take it easy before we kill each other.

MARK
(relaxing slightly)
What's going on with everybody?

DEAN
I don't know.

MARK
My neighbor . . . Mr. Rogers, he —

DEAN
You've got a neighbor named Mr. Rogers?

MARK
Not anymore.
(DEAN shakes his head)
He came at me with a hatchet. I put him down. He's not the only one, I mean, it's happening to everyone.

DEAN
I'm heading over to the Doc's place, there's still some people left.

MARK
No, no way. I'm getting the hell out.

DEAN
There's no way out, they got the bridge covered, now come on.

MARK
I don't believe you.

DEAN
Fine, stay here, be my guest.

MARK hesitates, then changes his mind. He pulls out a handgun and keeps it pointed towards DEAN as he gets into the passenger's side; DEAN still has his gun up as well.

DEAN
(muttering)
Well, this ought to be a relaxing drive.



INT. CLINIC - DAY

DR. LEE is again looking through the microscope; PAM huddles against the far wall.

PAM
What if we all have it? What if we all go crazy?

DR. LEE
You've got to stay calm. All we can do is wait. The Marshal's bringing help.

PAM
I can't, I . . . I've got to go.

DR. LEE
Pam!

PAM
No, you don't understand. My boyfriend's out there, I gotta make sure he's okay.

She hurries out of the lab, and SAM follows her all the way to the lobby.

SAM
All right, wait, wait. Please. Look, I know you're upset, all right? But it's safer if you stay here for now. Help is coming.

We hear the IMPALA pull up outside.

SAM
There they are.

DEAN (off-camera)
Sammy? Open up!

SAM opens the door to let in DEAN and MARK; both are still armed.

SAM
Did you guys, uh, get to a phone?

DEAN
Road block.
(to MARK)
I'm gonna have a word. Doc's inside.

SAM
What's going on out there, Dean?

DEAN
Man, I don't know, I feel like Chuck Heston in the Omega Man, I mean, Sarge is the only sane person I could find. What are we dealing with, do you know?

SAM
Yeah. Doc thinks it's a virus.

DEAN
Okay, great. What do you think?

SAM
I think she's right.

DEAN
Really?

SAM
Yeah. And I think the infected are trying to infect others with blood-to-blood contact. Oh, but it gets better. The uh, the virus? Leaves traces of sulfur in the blood.

DEAN
A demonic virus?

SAM
Yeah, more like demonic germ warfare. At least it explains why I've been having visions.

DEAN
It's like a Biblical plague.

SAM
Yeah. You don't know how right you are, Dean. I've been poring through Dad's journal, found something about the Roanoke colony.

DEAN
And?

SAM
Dad always had a theory about Croatoan. He thought it was a demon's name. Sometimes known as Deva or sometimes Resheph. A demon of plague and pestilence.

DEAN
Well, that, that's terrific. Why here, why now?

SAM
I have no idea. But Dean, who knows how far this thing can spread? We gotta get out of here, we gotta warn people.

MARK (off-screen)
They've got one! In here!

DEAN
(entering the next room)
What do you mean?

SAM
The wife. She's infected.

MARK
We've gotta take care of this. We can't just leave her in there. My neighbors, they were strong. The longer we wait, the stronger she'll get.

DEAN barely hesitates before pulling out his gun and stalking into the lab.



INT. LAB - DAY

PAM
You're gonna kill Beverly Tanner?

SAM
Doctor, could there be any treatment? Some kind of cure for this?

DEAN
Can you cure it?

DR. LEE
For God's sake, I don't even know what "it" is!

MARK
I told you, it's just a matter of time before she breaks through.

PAM
Just leave her in there, you can't shoot her like an animal!

DEAN
Sam.

They go to the door of the utility room, where BEVERLY is being held. DEAN and MARK hold their guns ready; SAM carefully opens the door, and DEAN and MARK take up offensive positions. Inside, BEVERLY is huddled on the floor, knees drawn up. She jumps at their approach.

BEVERLY
Mark, what are you doing? Mark, it's, it's them! They locked me in here, they, they tried to kill me! They're infected, not me! Please, Mark! You've known me all your life! Please!

DEAN
You sure she's one of 'em?

SAM nods, his face twisted in distress. As MARK pulls back, near tears, DEAN steps forward and fires twice.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. CLINIC - NIGHT

The shades are drawn, and MARK peers through them cautiously. A few people are gathered outside. Behind him, SAM pulls out a hunting knife and checks the blade as DEAN loads a gun. In the lab, PAM has just dropped a vial of blood; she screams.

PAM
Oh god! Is there any on me? Am I okay?

DR. LEE
You're clean, you're okay.

PAM
Why are we staying here? Please, let's just go!

DEAN
No, we can't, because those things are everywhere.

PAM
(sinking down)
Oh god . . .

DR. LEE
Hey, shh, shh.

SAM
(quietly)
She's right about one thing. We can't stay here. We've gotta get out of here, get to the Roadhouse? Somewhere. Let people know what's coming.

DEAN
Yeah, good point. Night of the Living Dead didn't exactly end pretty.

MARK
Well, I'm not sure we've got a choice. Lots of folks up here are good with rifles — even with all your hardware we're, we're easy targets. So unless you've got some explosives . . .

SAM glances up at a shelf of medical supplies and gets an idea.

SAM
We could make some.

He goes to the shelf and takes down a bottle of Potassium Chloride; just then, someone starts pounding frantically on the front door. The Boys run out.

DUANE (off-screen)
Hey! Let me in, let me in! Please!

MARK
It's Duane Tanner!

He opens the door and lets DUANE in. He has a backpack and is limping.

DUANE
Thank god.

MARK
Duane, you okay?

DEAN
(quietly, to SAM)
That's the guy that I, uh, *clicks tongue*

SAM
Yeah.

DUANE
Who else is in here?

DEAN
(grabbing his arm)
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy there, chief. Hey Doc! Give Duane a good once-over, would you?

DR. LEE
(leading the group into the lab)
Pam?

DUANE
Who are you?

DEAN
Never mind who I am. Doc.

DR. LEE
Yeah, okay.

MARK
Duane. Where you been?

DUANE
On a fishing trip up by Roslyn. I came back this afternoon. I . . . I saw Roger McGill being dragged out of his house by people we know! They started cutting him with knives! I ran, I've been hiding in the woods ever since. Has anybody seen my mom and dad?

DEAN
(turns to SAM, attempting a joking tone)
Awkward . . .

DUANE is sitting on a stool; his left leg has a deep gash in it.

DR. LEE
You're bleeding.

DEAN
Where'd you get that?

DUANE
I was running, I must have tripped.

DEAN
Tie him up, there's rope in there.

DUANE
Wait . . .

DEAN
(pulling his gun on DUANE)
Sit down!

MARK
I'm sorry, Duane, he's right. We've gotta be careful.

DUANE
Careful? About what?

DEAN
Did they bleed on you?

DUANE
No, what the hell? No!

SAM
Doc? Any way to know for sure, any test?

DR. LEE
I've studied Beverly's bloodwork backwards and forwards.

DUANE
My mom!

DR. LEE
It took three hours for the virus to incubate. The sulfur didn't appear in the blood until then, so . . . no, there'd be no way of knowing. Not until after Duane turns.

SAM
Dean, I gotta talk to you. Now.

DEAN glances at MARK, who nods. DEAN and SAM leave the lab.

MARK
Sit in that chair.



INT. ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT

SAM
This is my vision, Dean. It's happening.

DEAN
Yeah, I figured.

SAM
You can't kill him, all right? Not yet. We don't know if he's infected or not.

DEAN
Well, I think we're pretty damn sure. Guy shows up out of nowhere, he's got a cut on his leg, his whole family's infected?

SAM
All right, then we should keep him tied up, and we should wait and see.

DEAN
For what? For him to Hulk out and infect somebody else? No thanks, can't take that chance.

He starts to push past SAM, who stops him with a hand on his chest.

DEAN
Hey look, man, I'm not happy about this, okay? But it's a tough job and you know that.

SAM
It's supposed to be tough, Dean. We're supposed to struggle with this, that's the whole point.

DEAN
What does that buy us?

SAM
A clear conscience, for one!

DEAN
Well, it's too late for that.

SAM
(stopping him again)
What the hell's happened to you?

DEAN
What?

SAM
You might kill an innocent man, and you don't even care! You don't act like yourself anymore, Dean. Hell, you know what? You're acting like one of those things out there.

DEAN
Mm-hmm.

DEAN pushes past SAM a third time; SAM tries to stop him again but DEAN hurls him against the far wall. He goes back into the hall and locks the door behind him.

SAM
Hey!
(rattling the lock)
Open the damn door, Dean! Don't do it, Dean! Don't!

DEAN is now in the hallway from the vision in the TEASER. He drops the clip out of the gun and taps it against the butt, then replaces it. He opens the door to the lab and shuts it behind him; DUANE is tied to the chair and MARK, PAM and DR. LEE stand nearby.

DUANE
No, you're not gonna . . . No, no, I swear it's not in me!

PAM
Oh God. We're all gonna die.

MARK
Maybe he's telling the truth.

DEAN
No, he's not him, not anymore.

DUANE
Stop it! Ask her, ask the doctor! It's not in me!

DR. LEE
I . . . I can't tell.

DUANE
(sobbing)
Please, don't. Don't, please. I swear, it's not in me, it's not in me, I swear, I, I swear it's not in me. No, don't.

DEAN
I got no choice.

The moment stretches on: DEAN pointing the gun at DUANE with his finger hovering over the trigger, DUANE sobbing, the others watching in tense silence. DEAN trembles, hesitates, and finally lowers the gun with a grimace.

DEAN
Damn it!

DUANE pants in relief as DEAN leaves the room.



LATER:

DEAN and SAM are preparing explosives with rags and glass bottles. DR. LEE enters, hands in her pockets.

DR. LEE
It's been over four hours. Duane's blood is still clean. I don't think he's infected. I'd like to untie him, if that's all right.

DEAN and SAM share a look; SAM nods, DEAN lowers his head.

SAM
Sure. Yeah.
(she leaves)
You know I'm gonna ask you why.

DEAN
Yeah, I know.

SAM
So why? Why didn't you do it?

DEAN
We need more alcohol.

SAM gets up and goes into the dispensary and finds PAM already there.

SAM
How you holding up, Pam?

PAM
Good. It'll all be over soon.

She shuts the door and locks it; SAM, his back turned, doesn't notice.

PAM
In fact, I've been waiting for this the whole time.

SAM
For what?

PAM
To get you alone.

She lashes out and knocks him to the ground. She straddles his chest and hits him, hard, across the face. Outside the room, DEAN and MARK hear the commotion and arm themselves. PAM has a scalpel in one hand, which she slices across SAM'S chest and then across her own palm, placing her wound over his. DEAN kicks the door open and shoots her three times in the back. She convulses and falls to the floor. SAM reaches out a hand to DEAN, who starts to lean over to take it; MARK pulls him back.

MARK
She bled on him. He's got the virus.

SAM pulls his hand back, realizing it's true; close on DEAN'S face, stunned, looking from SAM to PAM.

END ACT THREE


ACT FOUR
INT. LAB - NIGHT

SAM is now sitting on the stool, a bandage pressed to his chest. His eyes are down, and he looks near tears. The others surround him, DEAN pacing angrily.

DEAN
Doc, check his wound again, would you?
(pause)
Doctor!

MARK
What's she need to examine him for? You saw what happened.

DR. LEE
Did her blood actually enter your wound?

MARK
Come on, of course it did!

DEAN
We don't know that for sure.

DUANE
We can't take a chance.

MARK
You know what we have to do.

DEAN
Nobody is shooting my brother.

DUANE
He isn't gonna be your brother much longer. You said it yourself.

DEAN
Nobody is shooting anyone!

DUANE
You were gonna shoot me!

DEAN
You don't shut your pie-hole, I still might!

SAM
Dean, they're right. I'm infected; just give me the gun and I'll do it myself.

DEAN
Forget it.

SAM
Dean, I'm not gonna become one of those things.

DEAN
Sam, we've still got some time,

MARK
Time for what? Look, I understand he's your brother, and I'm sorry, I am. But we gotta take care of this.

MARK pulls out his handgun.

DEAN
I'm gonna say this one time — you make a move on him, you'll be dead before you hit the ground. You understand me? I mean, do I make myself clear?!

MARK
Then what are we supposed to do?!

DEAN tosses MARK his keys.
DEAN
Get the hell out of here, that's what. Take my car. You've got the explosives, there's an arsenal in there. You two go with him. You've got enough firepower to handle anything now.

MARK
What about you?

SAM
(after a beat)
Dean, no. No. Go with them. This is your only chance!

DEAN
You're not gonna get rid of me that easy.

MARK
No, he's right. Come with us.
(beat)
Okay, it's your funeral.

He leads DUANE and DR. LEE out the door.

DR. LEE
I'm sorry. Thanks for everything, Marshals.

DEAN
Oh, actually we're not really Marshals.

DR. LEE
Um. Oh.

She leaves, and DEAN shuts the door behind her. He turns slowly to face SAM, who starts to cry.

DEAN
Wish we had a deck of cards, or a foosball table or something.

SAM
Dean, don't do this. Just get the hell out of here.

DEAN
No way.

SAM
Give me my gun, and leave.

DEAN
For the last time, Sam. No.

SAM
(slamming the table)
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done.

DEAN
Oh, I don't know about that. Remember that waitress in Tampa?
(shudders)

SAM
Dean, I'm sick. It's over for me. It doesn't have to be for you.

DEAN
No?

SAM
No, you can keep going.

DEAN
Who says I want to?

SAM
What?

DEAN crosses to the other wall and pulls a handgun out of his waistband before sitting on the file cabinet.

DEAN
I'm tired, Sam. I'm tired of this job, this life . . . this weight on my shoulders, man. I'm tired of it.

SAM
So what, so you're just going to give up? You're just gonna lay down and die? Look, Dean, I know this stuff with Dad has —

DEAN
You're wrong. It's not about Dad. I mean, part of it is, sure, but . . .

SAM
What is it about?

They hear a noise outside; a moment later there's a knocking on the door. DEAN picks up both handguns and crosses to it; DR. LEE is there. He opens the door.

DR. LEE
You'd better come see this.



EXT. CLINIC - NIGHT

All five survivors are standing just outside the clinic; everything else in sight is deathly silent.

DR. LEE
There's no one. Not anywhere. They've all just . . . vanished.

Close shot of a telephone pole into which is carved "CROATOAN".



INT. CLINIC - MORNING

DR. LEE is looking through the microscope; SAM is seated on the exam table.

DR. LEE
Well, it's been five hours and your blood's still clean. I don't understand it but I think you dodged a bullet.

SAM
But I was exposed. How could I not be infected?

DR. LEE
I don't know. But you're just not. I mean, you compare it with the Tanner samples . . .
(she looks through another microscope)
What the hell?

SAM
What?

DR. LEE
Their blood. There's no trace of the virus. No sulfur, nothing.



EXT. CLINIC - DAY

MARK and DUANE are loading up a truck; DR. LEE stands in the doorway of the clinic.

DUANE
Hey, the Sarge and I are getting the hell out of here, heading south. You should come.

DR. LEE
I'd better get over to Sidewinder, get the authorities up here. If they'll believe me. Take care.

MARK waves to her and to DEAN and SAM, who are leaning against the IMPALA.

DEAN
What about him?

DR. LEE
He's going to be fine. No signs of infection.

DR. LEE goes back inside as MARK and DUANE pull away in the truck. DEAN turns to SAM.

SAM
Hey man, don't look at me. I got no clue.

DEAN
I swear, I'm gonna lose sleep over this one. I mean, why here, why now? And where the hell did everybody go? It's like they just friggin' melted.

SAM
Why was I immune?

DEAN
Yeah. You know what? That's a good question. You know, I'm already starting to feel like this is the one that got away?

They get in the car and pull away from town.



EXT. BLACKTOP - NIGHT

MARK drives his pickup down a dark two-lane road; DUANE is in the passenger's seat.

DUANE
You mind pulling over up ahead there?

MARK
All right.

He pulls onto the shoulder and stops the truck.

DUANE
I gotta make a call.

MARK
No phone out here.

DUANE
I got it covered.

He pulls out a small knife.

MARK
What the hell is that?

In a quick motion, DUANE lashes out, slitting MARK'S throat; he catches the blood in a metal bowl, just like the one MEG used to use. He sits back and dips his hand in the blood, swirling it around.

DUANE
It's over, you'll be pleased. I don't think any more tests are necessary.
(beat)
The Winchester boy, definitely immune, as expected.
(pause)
Yes, of course. Nothing left behind.

Close on DUANE'S face, whose eyes have gone demonic-black.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

The IMPALA is parked by the side of a road, overlooking a river. DEAN and SAM lean against a fence, drinking beer.

SAM
So. Last night. You want to tell me what the hell you were talking about?

DEAN
What do you mean?

SAM
What do I mean? I mean you said you were tired of the job. And that it wasn't just because of Dad.

DEAN
Forget it.

SAM
No, I can't. No way.

DEAN
Come on man, I thought we were both going to die, you can't hold that over me.

SAM
No, no, no, no. You can't pull that crap with me, man. You're talking.

DEAN
And what if I don't?

SAM
Then I guess I'll just have to keep asking until you do.

DEAN
I don't know, man. I just think maybe we ought to . . . go to the Grand Canyon.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Yeah, you know, all this driving back and forth across country, you know I've never been to the Grand Canyon? Or we could go to T.J. Or Hollywood, see if we can bang Lindsey Lohan.

SAM
You're not making any sense.

DEAN
I just think we should take a break from all this. Why do we gotta get stuck with all the responsibility, you know? Why can't we live life a little bit?

SAM
Why are you saying all this?

DEAN shakes his head, turning away.

SAM
No, no, no, no, Dean. You're my brother, all right? So whatever weight you're carrying, let me help a little bit.

DEAN
I can't. I promised.

SAM
Who?

DEAN
Dad.

SAM
What are you talking about?

DEAN
(looking down)
Right before Dad died, he told me something.
(takes a breath, then looks at SAM)
He told me something about you.

SAM
What? Dean, what did he tell you?
