NOW
INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM – DAY

The news is playing on TV.

TV: Yesterday this Galveston shoreline was being pounded by ten foot swells and winds up to 150 miles per hour…

One Year Ago

TV: …but today, well, there's not a cloud in sight. Hurricane Tiffany has broken up over the Gulf –

The camera pans to the other side of the room where Bobby is working on some sort of magical ritual. He cuts his palm and adds his blood to the ingredients in a large bowl.

BOBBY: Et ad congregandum... Eos coram me.

BOBBY lights a match and sets the ingredients in the bowl alight. CROWLEY appears in the kitchen doorway.

CROWLEY: Been making merry, have we?

BOBBY: Bite me.

CROWLEY: If that's your thing. (snaps fingers to turn off TV and steps toward Bobby) That Swan dive of Sam's was a thing of beauty. Tens all the way round. Standing ov from the Romanian judge. You should be proud, Bobby. As deaths go, it wasn’t too shabby. Cheer up, mate, we just saved the sodding world together. Me, I've been celebrating.

BOBBY: I'd hate to see what you call celebrating.

CROWLEY: Yes, you would.

Bobby lifts a bottle of alcohol and offers to Crowley

BOBBY: Drink?

CROWLEY: (looks appalled) No!

Bobby pours himself a drink.

BOBBY: Let me get this straight – we just (mocking Crowley's accent) “saved the sodding world together,” and you're too good to drink with me?

CROWLEY: Obviously. (Crowley points to a bottle on the television) I doubt that you have my brand.

BOBBY: What's your poison, your highness?

CROWLEY: (breaths in deep) Craig. Aged 30 years at least. I've been drinking it since grade school.

BOBBY: Well, I got old rotgut aged 6 days (Bobby takes a drink as Crowley watches)

CROWLEY: Swill like that is gonna burn a hole in your soul – oops sorry, my soul. But that’s why you called. Our little deal.

BOBBY: Yeah, well, it's about time you hold up your end and give it back.

CROWLEY: Give it back?

BOBBY: Our deal was, we ice Lucifer, you rip up the lease.

CROWLEY: (smirks) Oh. (turns away from Bobby) You didn't read your contract.

BOBBY: The hell you talking about, contract?

Crowley turns toward Bobby, snaps his fingers and points. Bobby writhes in pain as writing appears on his body.

CROWLEY: Paragraph 18, subsection B, which is on you naughty bits – I only have to make “best efforts” to give you back your soul.

BOBBY: Meaning what?

CROWLEY: Meaning… (makes a straining gesture and sighs) I’d like to – but I can't.

BOBBY: You lying sack of – (Crowley cuts him off)

CROWLEY: Ten years (Crowley walks across the room towards Bobby), you come to daddy. Until then, I suggest you start drinking the good stuff.

BOBBY: I figured you'd say that. So you can rot here till you change your mind.

CROWLEY: Why? ’Cause you asked nicely?

Bobby shakes his head.

BOBBY: No. (Bobby walks past Crowley to the back of the room) ’Cause I'm going Dateline on your ass. (Bobby turns off the light and we see a Devil's Trap painted on the floor in glowing paint.

CROWLEY: I hope that's paint. Really. (sighs) What am I going to do?

Bobby turns towards the kitchen to walk away and Crowley lets out a sharp whistle. We hear the growl of Crowley's hell hound. Bobby grimaces as the hell hound breaths on his face.

CROWLEY: Doggie breath. (Bobby is covering his face) Bracing, isn't it?

Bobby gulps and turns towards Crowley.

CROWLEY: Ball’s in your court, Robert. Ten years of living or ten years as Alpo.

Bobby looks in the direction of the growls and back at Crowley. Bobby looks at Crowley in disgust. Crowley just smirks happily as Bobby opens his pocket knife and approaches the circle. Bobby scrapes the paint, breaking the seal and setting Crowley free.

BOBBY: (holding his knife in a threatening manner) This ain't over.

CROWLEY: I wouldn't have it any other way. (Crowley walk out of the trap and pauses in front of Bobby) Happy hunting. Crowley walks off leaving Bobby fuming.

Kenosha, Wisconsin

Present Day


EXT. PARK – DAY

Children are playing in the playground and not far away Dean is examining a body with a large hole in its chest.

SAM: No EMF. Find anything in there?

Dean takes off his glove and drops it on the ground.

DEAN: Yeah, I've got some kind of a claw. (Dean picks up the claw from the ground)

SAM: What in the hell has a claw like that? (Dean pulls out his phone)

DEAN: That is a good question. (Dean makes a call)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

The phone is rings. The camera scopes the room, which appears to be empty.

INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN (over the phone): We gotta case here.

Bobby shakes his head.

BOBBY: I'll call you back. (He hangs up the phone)

Bobby starts his research. “The Gambler” by Kenny Rogers plays as he works. Bobby is getting frustrated.

BOBBY: Balls! (He slams a book shut)


EXT. BOBBY’S TOWN – DAY

Bobby is driving and passes his neighbour, who waves at him. Bobby waves back. He drives to Sioux Falls University Library, but it is closed. Bobby sighs and looks inside. Bobby then goes around back and breaks a window to get inside. Bobby climbs in the window and falls inside.

BOBBY: Balls!

Bobby goes back to the car with a book. Bobby tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.

BOBBY: Come on. Come on. (Bobby tries the engine one more time and sighs) Balls.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby makes it back home at 1:07 am and does more research. The clock on his desk ticks over. Bobby starts to nod off. The clock reads 2:47 am and keeps ticking to 3:02 am, when Bobby wakes with a start. He takes some pills and drinks lots of coffee to keep going.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby is still at his desk at 5:09 am. He phones Dean.

BOBBY: You're hunting a Lamia.


INT. MOTEL ROOM, WISCONSIN – DAY

BOBBY (over the phone): It's a monster.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

BOBBY: Juices hearts, chugs the blood. (sighs) Never heard of one popping up…


INT. MOTEL ROOM, WISCONSIN – DAY

BOBBY (over the phone): … outside of Greece though.

Dean gets up.

DEAN: Yeah, well, looks like this freak is immigrating. It’s snacking on cheese heads.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN (over the phone): How do we gank it?

Bobby yawns.

BOBBY: There’s a couple of ways. Easiest is a silver knife blessed…


INT. MOTEL ROOM, WISCONSIN – DAY

BOBBY (over the phone): …by a padre.

DEAN: (still chewing) Gotcha. (He hangs up the phone)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby looks at the receiver and speaks to the dial tone.

BOBBY: You're welcome.

Bobby hangs up and puts down the phone as he yawns.

FEMALE VOICE: Hey, I'm still here!

Bobby walks downstairs to the panic room.

CROSSROADS DEMON: Hey there, cranky. You were gone so long, I just assumed alcoholic coma.

The crossroads demon, who has red eyes, is tied to a chair inside a devil's trap.

BOBBY: Where were we?

CROSSROADS DEMON (purrs): Your soul.

BOBBY: Right. Talk.

CROSSROADS DEMON: Look at you, all in a rush. Foreplay… (uncrosses her legs and recrosses them) …gets you more play.

BOBBY: I want Crowley's name. (The crossroads demon looks at him and smiles) His real name, back when he was flesh and blood.

CROSSROADS DEMON: (changes eyes from red to normal) Does tying up demons in your basement make you feel better about that time that you killed your wife?

Bobby picks up a bag and brings it over to the demon.

CROSSROADS DEMON: What's that?

BOBBY: You don't recognize them? They're yours.

Bobby places the bag in a large metal tub. He lights a flame thrower.

CROSSROADS DEMON: It won't work. It's a myth.

Bobby is looking at the flame.

BOBBY: Then you got nothing to worry about.

Bobby points the flames over the metal tub. The demon screams in pain. Bobby lowers the flame thrower.

CROSSROADS DEMON: (gasping in pain) I can't.

Bobby makes the flames higher again over the tub. The demon screams. Bobby lowers the flame thrower.

CROSSROADS DEMON: (her flesh burned) You don't know what he’ll do to me.

BOBBY: Right now you better worry about me.

CROSSROADS DEMON: You don't get it. He's the King.

Bobby burns her again.

BOBBY: King of the Crossroads. I've heard the speech.

CROSSROADS DEMON: (groaning in pain) No. King of Hell.

The doorbell rings. Bobby blows out the pilot of the flame thrower. The doorbell rings again.

CROSSROADS DEMON: You gonna get that or what?

CUT TO:

Bobby walks to the front door as the bell rings again. Bobby looks through the peephole and sees his female neighbor holding something and arranging her hair. Bobby checks his breath and tries to straighten his clothes a bit before opening the door and stepping onto the porch.


EXT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

BOBBY: (looks around) Marcy.

MARCY: Bobby Singer. How long have we been neighbors?

BOBBY: (guessing) Six months?

MARCY: Well, don't you think it's time you welcomed me to the neighborhood? (Marcy offers the tray to Bobby and uncovers it) My famous ginger peach cobbler.

Bobby looks at it, then at Marcy.

MARCY: Take a whiff. Seriously, I'm a genius.

Bobby sniffs, rolls his eyes and smiles. Marcy also smiles. Marcy then hears the crossroads demon screaming for help. Bobby closes the door slightly.

BOBBY: It's stupid horror flicks. Guilty pleasure.

MARCY: I love scary movies. Hey have you seen “Drag Me To Hell”?

BOBBY: (awkward pause) Trying to avoid it.

MARCY: But it's fantastic. (Marcy takes a deep breath) Saturday, seven o'clock, my house. I'll fix you dinner and I'll whip up a batch of my famous white chocolate popcorn and we'll watch it. Deal?

Bobby looks down.

BOBBY: That sounds super, Marcy, but uh –

MARCY: Okay, no worries. Um, hey, one other thing. Uh, my wood chipper – it’s a piece of crap, you know. It just broke down on me and – and I hear that you’re quite handy. Maybe you could come over and take a look. You know, just whenever –

BOBBY: Yeah. I'll see what I can do.

MARCY: (smiling, pleased) Okay.

The two look at each other, then shake hands.

MARCY: Well, okay… (Marcy holds Bobby's hand for a little longer) …okay, I'll see you soon.

Marcy waves goodbye. She and Bobby turn to leave, each looking back at the other a few times. Bobby closes the door and smiles at the cobbler in his hands.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby walks down the stairs to the basement.

CROSSROADS DEMON: Aww. She sounds nice. (Bobby walks past the demon, ignoring her) Are you going to make sweet love to her before you stab her to death, Bobby? (Bobby relights the pilot of the flame thrower) That is your usual thing, right?

Bobby aims the flame at the metal tub and the demon starts screaming again.

BOBBY: I want Crowley's name now! (The demon continues to scream and we see her flesh blister and burn) Crowley's name!

CROSSROADS DEMON: (whimpering) Okay, okay. (Bobby take the flame off the tub) MacLeod. Fergus MacLeod. I swear. We call him Lucky the Leprechaun behind his back.

BOBBY: MacLeod's Scottish, Einstein.

CROSSROADS DEMON: You got what you want, now send me back. (Bobby grabs a can of lighter fluid and soaks what's in the tub) No! (Bobby keeps pouring lighter fluid) We had a deal.

BOBBY: I gave it my best effort.

CROSSROADS DEMON: No!

The demon screams as Bobby torches the items in the tub. When he is finished, Bobby blows out the pilot light of the flame thrower.


ACT TWO
INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

The scene opens on a map of Scotland. The phone rings. Bobby checks the caller ID and answers.

BOBBY: Yeah, Garth, what do you got? (Bobby listens to Garth) Never heard of a vamp doin’ that. It doesn't sound like our kind of thing. Better drop a dime to the FBI.

Bobby hangs up the phone and places it back on its charger. Another phone labeled “FBI Tom Willis” rings.

BOBBY: Willis, FBI. (Bobby listens to the caller) No, Garth, not me, the FBI. The real FBI! How are you still alive?

Bobby hangs up the phone and another line rings. It is labeled “CDC Frank Castle”.

BOBBY: Yeah, Castle.

Another phone line rings.

BOBBY: Yeah.

Another line rings.

BOBBY: Yeah.

Another call.

BOBBY: Willis.

Bobby is trying to do some work and the phone rings again.

BOBBY: Uh huh. Of course she's one of ours. And if she says she's got to dig that grave up, you better damn well let her.

Bobby hangs up the phone labeled “Police Pete Lovell”. Bobby tries to take a sip of coffee and another line rings. Bobby looks bored listening to the caller, then hangs up. Bobby is reading and drinking his coffee when he hears banging on his door. Bobby gets up to answer the back kitchen door. It is Rufus Turner.

RUFUS: (out of breath) Oh, good, you’re home! Listen. You gotta help me bury a body.

Bobby stares in disbelief, then rolls his eyes.


EXT. BOBBY’S YARD – DAY

Bobby is walking with Rufus.

BOBBY: Why'd you bring it here?

RUFUS: The law is on my tail! What was your guess? (Bobby looks at Rufus) What, what, what? They got lucky.

BOBBY: Yeah, or you’re getting slow.

RUFUS: Yeah, I'm getting slow – says mister sits on his ass all day taking calls.

Bobby and Rufus reach Rufus' truck. Rufus lowers the tailgate and uncovers the body of an Asian woman. Rufus gestures at the body.

BOBBY: (looking at the body) Vamp, shifter – what?

RUFUS: None of the above. (Rufus pulls the lips on the body back to expose the teeth and looks over at Bobby)

BOBBY: Okami? Where’d you shiv it?

RUFUS: Get this. Billings. (Rufus closes the mouth)

BOBBY: The only time I ever saw one of these was in Japan.

RUFUS: Duh. No one's ever seen one of these except in Japan.

BOBBY: For what it's worth, Sam and Dean are tracking a Lamia in Wisconsin.

RUFUS: Get out. I thought they never leave Greece.

Bobby shakes his head slightly.

BOBBY: Monsters lately. Is it me, or is it weird?

RUFUS: Yeah well, it’s definitely something. (Rufus stops pondering and snaps his head up) So, you got a shovel?

Bobby uses a mechanical digger to dig a hole. Rufus stands by with a shovel, watching Bobby operate the machine.

RUFUS: Man, I know what I want for Hanukkah.

CUT TO: Bobby and Rufus approach a deep, rectangular hole in the ground. Rufus drops the body into the hole.

CUT TO: Bobby and Rufus are finishing filling in the hole.

RUFUS: So the son of a bitch's name is Fergus McCloud?

BOBBY: That's the son of a bitch's name.

RUFUS: (raking the dirt over the ground) Where are you gonna look?

BOBBY: (rests on shovel to look at Rufus) Scotland. Crowley let slip that he likes Craig. It's, uh –

RUFUS: (Rufus stops raking) It's Scotch. Only made and sold in a tiny area on the north tip of Caithness county. It's peaty and sharp, with a long finish of citrus and tobacco notes. (Rufus goes back to raking as Bobby stares at him. Rufus notices and stops) Hey, what? What am I, a heathen? (Rufus throws out his arms) I know what Craig is.

BOBBY: Well, I got a hunch that that's where Crowley lived and died back when he was a human, a few hundred years before he got the big squeeze in hell and came out a demon.

RUFUS: (stops to look at Bobby) You know I've got contacts over there. (pauses) I could make a few calls. (starts to rake again)

BOBBY: (rests on shovel again) Well, I ain't askin' for no help.

RUFUS: (rests on his rake) I ain't askin' for your permission.

Rufus and Bobby smooth over the dirt.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby is about to cut a piece of the cobbler when the phone rings. Bobby puts down the knife and walks over to the phone.

BOBBY: Yeah.


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

DEAN: What's another way to kill a Lamia?


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

BOBBY: Well, what happened to the silver knife…


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

There is a dead priest at Dean's feet.

BOBBY (over the phone): … blessed by a priest?

DEAN: That didn't pan out. What's plan B?

In the background we see Sam being tossed into a pillar. Dean winces.

SAM: (in pain) Dean. (Sam is pulled away from the pillar)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby is looking in a book and he hears knocking on the front door.

VOICE AT DOOR: Police!

Bobby (still on the phone): Balls!


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

DEAN: Come on Bobby, get the lead out!


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby is looking through the book.

BOBBY: Where are you?


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

DEAN: In a church. In a rectory.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby still looking though the book.

BOBBY: Is there a kitchen?

DEAN (over the phone): Yeah.

BOBBY: Find salt...


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

Dean is scoping out the kitchen listening to Bobby with the creature's growls in the background.

BOBBY (over the phone): …and rosemary.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby raises his head at the pounding at his door.

VOICE AT DOOR: Open up, Singer!


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

Sam is being tossed around in the kitchen while Dean, still on the phone with Bobby, searches the cabinets for salt and rosemary.


EXT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

At Bobby's front door is Sheriff Jody Mills and a man.

Bobby, still on the phone, opens the door and the man flashes an FBI badge at him.

AGENT ADAMS: Mr. Singer. I'm Agent Adams. (Adams puts away his badge) I believe you know Sheriff Mills.


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

Dean is still searching the kitchen cabinets.


EXT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby gestures that he will be with Agent Adams and Sheriff Mills in a moment.

BOBBY: My mom. Just a sec.

Bobby turns to walk into the study.


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

Dean is still looking in the cabinets and he gets excited.

DEAN: Rosemary! (The creature growls)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN (over the phone): I got it!

Agent Adams and Sheriff Mills follow Bobby into the house.

BOBBY: Great, great. Now blend the herbs…


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

Dean is pouring the salt into a bowl.

BOBBY (over the phone): …saute over a high heat…


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

BOBBY: Cook well.


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

Dean drops his phone and tosses the mix at the Lamia. It screeches.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby listens to the screams over the phone.


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

Dean is pulling the stove away from the wall. The Lamia tosses Sam hard into a corner.

DEAN: Sammy!

Dean is trying to light his lighter.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN: (voice heard as the lighter clicks) Fire in the hole!


INT. CHURCH, WISCONSIN – DAY

Dean is using the gas line as a makeshift flamethrower and aims it at the Lamia. Sam shields himself in the corner. The creature's screams are heard.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

BOBBY: Okay. Great. Great. Enjoy the roast, Mom.

Bobby hangs up the phone and turns to see Agent Adams and Sheriff Mills standing behind him.

AGENT ADAMS: (has a sketch in his hand) Have you seen this man? Rufus Turner, aka Luther Vandros, aka Ruben Studdard.

BOBBY: No, I've never seen that dick.

AGENT ADAMS: How do you know he's a dick?

BOBBY: Lucky guess.

Sheriff Mills rolls her eyes.

AGENT ADAMS: Funny. ’Cause I got a couple of guys working the highway said they saw him pull in here. Carrying a body.

BOBBY: Well, that's ridiculous. Look, it's a workday, I gotta…

AGENT ADAMS: I just want to take a look around.

Bobby takes two steps in Agent Adams’ direction.

BOBBY: You got a warrant, sonny?

AGENT ADAMS: (walking forward to be in Bobby's face) Well, do I need one, sir?

The two stare at each other.

SHERIFF MILLS: (patting both men on the chest) Okay fellas, put the rulers away. Zip up. (talks to Agent Adams) Look, Bobby here is a kind of a (looks at Bobby for the right word) crank. And he ain't what you call a fan of big brother, but me and him – (to Bobby) How long I been arresting you now? Ten years?

BOBBY: Thereabouts.

SHERIFF MILLS: Yeah, we got a history, so... what do you say just let me scope the place out? That okay? You could just wait outside.

AGEBT ADAMS: (looks at Sheriff Mills then turns for the door) Five minutes.

Sheriff Mills watches Agent Adams go outside. She turns back to Bobby.

BOBBY: Why did you send him outside?

SHERIFF MILLS: ’Cause I didn't think you’d want him in here.

BOBBY: I don't. I've got a body in the basement.

SHERIFF MILLS: My point.

BOBBY: Yeah, but I've got another body buried in the yard. (Sheriff Mills' eyes get wide)

SHERIFF MILLS: Damn it. (She goes to the front door to look outside, then looks at Bobby.) He's not there.

BOBBY: (irritated sigh) Balls!


EXT. BOBBY’S YARD – DAY

Sheriff Mills and Bobby walk outside and find Agent Adams.

AGENT ADAMS: Mr. Singer, come with me, please.

Bobby and Sheriff Mills exchange a look, then follow Agent Adams. Agent Adams stops in front of a now empty hole where Rufus and Bobby buried the Okami.

AGENT ADAMS: Do you mind explaining this?

BOBBY: What, you never had a septic tank explode on you? I got it pretty well cleaned up, but watch where you step.

Agent Adams checks the bottom of his shoes.


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

Rufus is driving while on the phone with Bobby.

BOBBY (over the phone): Get back here!

RUFUS: Get back – I’m two states over, Bobby. I can't.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby is on the phone while carrying a large bag.

BOBBY: The Okami ain't dead.


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

RUFUS: Of course it is.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby pulls various knives out of a bag.

BOBBY: Did you use a bamboo dagger?

RUFUS (over the phone): Yeah.

BOBBY: Blessed by a Shinto priest?


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

RUFUS: I'm not an imbecile, Bobby.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Did you stab it seven times?


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

RUFUS: (pauses) Five times.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY (exasperated): It's seven!


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

RUFUS: No, I'm pretty sure it's five.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Well, clearly it's seven times.


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): The damn hole is empty.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: What was it feeding on when you found it?


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

RUFUS: Single white females –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

RUFUS (over the phone): While they slept.

Bobby has an “oh, no” look on his face.


INT. MARCY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Marcy is getting ready to go to bed. She closes an open window and locks it. She turns to go down the hall and we see a figure quickly pass the window. Marcy locks the front door as something watches from the kitchen. She has just walked away from the door when Bobby kicks in the door. Marcy screams. MARCY: Bobby?

BOBBY: (out of breath) Where's your bedroom?

Marcy, still in shock, points the way and Bobby runs down the hall. Bobby pushes open the door and checks under the bed. As Bobby continues searching the room, Marcy walks in.

MARCY: Bobby, I'm trying to keep my cool but, what are you doing in my house with a shotgun?

BOBBY: (stops searching to look at Marcy) Have you seen anything (pauses for the right word) weird?

MARCY: (raises eyebrows) You mean besides you?

Marcy's eyes wander up to the corner of the ceiling and she gasps. Bobby follows her gaze to the corner behind him and the Okami pounces on him. The Okami wrestles with Bobby and tosses him out the window. The Okami then turns to Marcy, who quickly backs out of the room, closing the door. The Okami goes out the same window Bobby did. Bobby is just getting up when the Okami rushes him and knocks him back down. Bobby gets up and the Okami lunges at him again, but Bobby sidesteps and it crashes into a tree. Bobby tries to keep it pinned against the tree but the Okami punches him and he flies backwards. He hits the wood chipper and powers it up by accident. The Okami attacks again. The two wrestle near the blades. Marcy comes running outside.

MARCY: (screaming) Bobby, no! Look out!

Bobby knees the Okami and rolls out from under her. Bobby shoves the Okami toward the blades and blood and flesh start to come out of the other end of the wood chipper... where Marcy is standing. Bobby is hit with some of the blood as the rest of the Okami is shredded. Bobby then walks towards the controls to turn off the wood chipper and sees Marcy.

BOBBY: I, uh – I thought your chipper was broke.

MARCY: (covered in blood and in shock) I just said that to get you over here.

BOBBY: (pauses) Oh. Well, I guess I could come over for dinner some night. Might be fun.

MARCY: I don't think so.

BOBBY: (has an “it figures” look and nods) Story of my life.


ACT THREE

Bobby is on the phone with Rufus.

RUFUS (over the phone): You're still alive, huh.

BOBBY: Don't act so surprised.


EXT. DINER – DAY

Rufus is parked in front of a diner while talking to Bobby.

RUFUS: How about Godzilla?

BOBBY: Put her down.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

RUFUS (over the phone): So you just happened to have a bamboo dagger blessed by a Shinto priest laying around?

BOBBY: Wood chipper.


EXT. DINER – DAY

RUFUS: Oh, okey dokey. Wood chipper, that – that pretty much trumps everything.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby nods.


EXT. DINER – DAY

RUFUS: Look, listen, Bobby, thank you. I screwed up.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

BOBBY: Forget it. I figure –


EXT. DINER – DAY

Rufus is taken aback by Bobby's words.

INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby grabs a pencil.

RUFUS (over the phone): AKA –

EXT. DINER – DAY

BOBBY (over the phone): I'd appreciate your –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

BOBBY: (making a face) …help getting it.


EXT. DINER – DAY

RUFUS: (chuckles) I'm way ahead of you, brother.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

RUFUS (over the phone): I'm headed for Andover now. I should be there about midnight.


EXT. DINER – DAY

RUFUS: You’re, um... you’re thinking hostage exchange, aren't you?


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

RUFUS (over the phone): I mean, you get the ring, you can summon Junior’s ghost.


EXT. DINER – DAY

RUFUS: Get the ghost, you can swap Crowley his son for your soul.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

BOBBY: Something like that.


EXT. DINER – DAY

RUFUS: Let's hope that works out.


EXT. BOBBY’S YARD – NIGHT


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby opens the refrigerator to get the cobbler Marcy made him. He picks up a knife to cut a slice when the phone rings. Bobby puts down the knife to answer the phone. The caller ID says “John P. Jones.”

BOBBY: Dean. You alright?


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: Yeah. Yeah, the Lamia grilled up fine.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: I sense a “but” coming on.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: It's Sam, Bobby.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby looks upwards.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: He's just – he's different. You know, I get it. You go through something like that and – and you change, but (sees Sam outside the hotel window talking on the phone) something's not right to me.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby hears the other line beeping and checks the caller ID.

BOBBY: Dean.

DEAN (over the phone): I got a few questions –


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: …about that year.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN (over the phone): You saw him and I didn't.

BOBBY: Dean. I got another call.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: You what?

BOBBY (over the phone): Just hang on.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: I got take this. It's –


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY: …important.

DEAN: (laughs) More important than Sam? (Dean hears a click on the line) Bobby?


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby can hear sirens over the phone.

BOBBY: Rufus?


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

Rufus is driving very fast with police sirens and lights flashing behind him.

RUFUS: The good news is I snagged the ring, Bobby.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

RUFUS (over the phone): However...

BOBBY: Tell me that ain't –

RUFUS (over the phone): Yeah, yeah, yeah.


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

RUFUS: Three guesses and one of them – it ain't the paramedics.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby listens helplessly.


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

RUFUS: Listen, Bobby. Bobby, I gotta stash –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

RUFUS (over the phone): …this ring.

BOBBY: Well, don't swallow it.


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

RUFUS: (pauses) Right! I'm swallowing it, Bobby! (Rufus swallows the ring)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Don't swallow it! (Bobby can hear Rufus swallowing, then drinking something)


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

Rufus sighs.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Damn it.

RUFUS (over the phone): Oh, hell.

POLICE OFFICER’S VOICE (heard over the phone): Hands where I can see them!

RUFUS (over the phone): Whoa, whoa, whoa! That is unnecessary force! I know my rights!

Bobby hangs up on Rufus and clicks back to Dean.

BOBBY: Still there, Dean?


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: Bobby, what the hell?


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby looks annoyed.

BOBBY: I, uh – sorry.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

Dean stands up.

DEAN: You know you are the one person that I can talk to about this stuff, about Sam –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN (over the phone): …about leaving Lisa and Ben. I mean I don't –I don’t even know which way is up right now.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: Bobby?


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby is staring off into the distance.

DEAN (over the phone): Hello?

BOBBY: I – I hear you, son. I – it just ain’t a good time.

DEAN (over the phone): Yeah, okay. You know what –


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: Forget it. I mean I'm baring my soul like a freaking girl here and, uh –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN (over the phone): And you've got stuff to do. So that is – that's fine.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: That's fine but, seriously, a little selfish.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN (over the phone): Not all about you.

Bobby gets angry and leans forward.

BOBBY: Where's your brother?


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

Dean makes a face like “why do you ask.”

DEAN: Outside.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Get him.

Bobby pours himself a drink as Dean fetches Sam.

DEAN (over the phone): You're on speaker, Bobby.

BOBBY: Sam. Dean.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): I love you like my own. I do. But sometimes –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby pauses and takes a long drink.

BOBBY: Sometimes…


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): You two are the whiniest, most self-absorbed sons of bitches I ever met!


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: I'm selfish? Me? I do everything for you! Everything! You need some lores scrounged up –


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): You need your asses pulled out of the fire –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: You need someone to bitch to about each other –


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

Sam looks at Dean, puzzled.

BOBBY (over the phone): You call me and I come through –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Every damn time!


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): And what do I get for it?


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Jack with a side of squat!


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN: Bobby –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Do I sound like I'm done?


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): Now look. I know you've got issues.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby is pacing the room.

BOBBY: God knows I know. But I got a news flash for you. You ain't the center of the universe!


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): Now, it may have slipped your mind…


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: …that Crowley owns my soul! And the meter is running!


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): And I will be damned if I'm going to sit around –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: And – and be damned! So how about you two sack up and help me for once?


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

Dean looks very humble and Sam calm.

SAM: Bobby, all – all you got to do is ask.

DEAN: Anything you need... we're there.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby, still cooling off, shakes his head.


EXT. BRIDGE – DAY

Bobby is leaning on a car, arms crossed, waiting. Sheriff Mills drives up, puts the patrol car in park and turns off the engine.

SHERIFF MILLS: I got a call from Marcy Wards. Seems she had a little “home invasion?” Told her I’d look into it. (The Sheriff smiles) Didn't bother filing a report.

BOBBY: Thanks. (takes a deep breath) I need a favor.

SHERIFF MILLS: Luther Vandros show up? Tell him I'm a fan.

BOBBY: His real name is Rufus Turner. He's being held in Andover, Mass., on a burglary charge. I need you to get him extradited here.

SHERIFF MILLS: Extradited? Extradited for what?

BOBBY: Murder.

SHERIFF MILLS: (laughs, then sees that Bobby is not joking) You’re not joking? (Bobby shakes his head) Do you have any idea what it takes to extradite a prisoner? I'd need a court order, permission from the DA... I –I would have to call in every marker I've got and hand out a few to boot.

BOBBY: So you're saying there's a chance.

SHERIFF MILLS: And if by some miracle we can get him here, then what? Then your pal's here on a murder charge. How are you gonna get him out from under that one?

BOBBY: Let me handle the B side.

SHERIFF MILLS: (laughs) I like you, Bobby. (Bobby lowers his head a bit) But this could nuke my career.

BOBBY: (sighs) Look, I've done a lot for this town. Some you know about. (Tilts head) Some you don't. And I'm not real good at this whole asking for help thing but –

SHERIFF MILLS: I'm sorry, Bobby. I can't.

Sheriff Mills starts the patrol car and drives off.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – DAY

Bobby pours himself a drink. Bobby is about to take a drink when he hears knocking on the door. Bobby opens the door to see Sheriff Mills.... with Rufus.

RUFUS: Miss me?

Rufus walks into Bobby's kitchen. Bobby looks in shock at Sheriff Mills.

BOBBY: How did you –

SHERIFF MILLS: (shakes her head) Don't ask. You got one hour, then I call the feds and tell them he busted out.

BOBBY: Thanks.

SHERIFF MILLS: I lose my job over this, I am taking it out of your ass!

Sheriff Mills leaves as Bobby nods to himself. Bobby then turns his attention to Rufus, who is looking around the kitchen.

BOBBY: Please tell me the ring is still in your stomach.

Rufus fishes in his pants pocket and produces the ring for Bobby. Bobby looks at the ring.

BOBBY: I'll go boil some water.

Bobby walks off.

RUFUS: What?


ACT FOUR
INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby pours a circle of salt and appears to be performing a summoning spell.

BOBBY: Amate spiritus oscorte tae quadaramos aramos nobiscume quarde ahpule nos chikitara.

Bobby throws something at a candle that makes the flame flare high. Bobby can soon see his breath in front of him. There is a ghost flickering to his right. Bobby slowly turns to look at the spirit.

BOBBY: Gavin MacLeod?

GAVIN: Yes. (pause) Is – is this hell?

BOBBY: That's gonna depend on you. (Gavin stares at Bobby) You Fergus MacLeod's boy? (Gavin nods) You and me... we're gonna have a nice long chat.

CUT TO: Bobby is performing another summoning ritual. This time Crowley shows up and he looks very annoyed.

BOBBY: Well, you look like hammered crap.

CROWLEY: And you're a vision as always.

Bobby and Crowley look each other over, then Crowley looks up to see that he is standing beneath a devil's trap.

CROWLEY: Don't we both know how this game ends? Really Bobby, you gotta know when to fold 'em.

BOBBY: Word on the street is that ever since Lucifer went to the pokey, you’re the big kahuna downstairs.

CROWLEY: I see you've been reading the trades.

BOBBY: Trouble in Paradise?

CROWLEY: Mate. You... have no idea. (Crowley gets a glass and pours a drink he has brought himself) I thought… when I got the corner office… (Crowley drops some antacid in the drink) I thought it was all going to be rainbows and two-headed puppies. (turns to look at Bobby) But, if I'm being honest, it's been hell. (takes a drink)

BOBBY: I thought that was the point.

CROWLEY: (finishes his drink and puts the glass on the table) You know what the problem with demons is?

BOBBY: They're demons.

CROWLEY: Exactly. Evil lying prats. The whole lot of them. And stupid. Try to show them a – a new way, a better way. And what do you get? Bugger all. You know, there's days that I think Lucifer's whole “Spike anything with black eyes” plan wasn't half bad. Hmm. Feels good to get it off my chest. We should make this a thing.

BOBBY: (sarcastically) Do I look like Dr. Phil to you?

CROWLEY: A little. (Bobby gives him a dirty look) Anyhoo. Obviously not here for a social call. So on with it.

BOBBY: I want –

Crowley grunts to interrupt and puts up his hand.

CROWLEY: Save you the recap. In fact I'll do the shorthand for you. (points at Bobby and speaks in a mock Bobby voice) I want my soul back, idjit. (points at self) 'Fraid not. (points at Bobby and speaks in mock voice) But I'm surly and I got a beard. Gimme! Blah, blah, blah. Homespun cornpone insult, witty retort from yours truly. The bottom line is, you get bubkes. Are we done?

BOBBY: Just getting started.

Bobby looks over to his left and Gavin appears. Crowley looks startled. He looks at Gavin, then Bobby and back to Gavin.

CROWLEY: Gavin? (Gavin stares at Crowley) Is that you? It – it's been so long. (Gavin continues to stare) I love you so – (Crowley can no longer pretend and laughs) Sorry. Your soul for my boy, is that it, right? I've got to give you credit for thinking outside the box on that one, but – problem is... I loathe the little bastard. You want to torture him, just let me pull up a chair and watch. Hell, burn his bones and send him down to me and we can have a family reunion. That right, son? You picked the wrong bargaining chip this time, my friend.

BOBBY: He ain't a chip. (Crowley looks confused) I was just using him to dig up dirt on you. And since Gavin hates you maybe even more than you hate him, he was more than happy to squawk.

CROWLEY: What did you tell him, son?

GAVIN: (smiles wickedly) Everything.

Gavin looks very satisfied then flickers out.

BOBBY: (walking toward Crowley) I know it all now. Fergus. You may be king of the dirt bags here but, in life, you were nothing but a two-bit tailor who sold his soul in exchange for an extra three inches below the belt.

CROWLEY: Just trying to hit double digits. (Bobby smiles at Crowley) So, you got a glimpse behind the curtain. And?

BOBBY: And – now I know where you’re planted.

Bobby picks up a cell phone and tosses it at Crowley. Crowley puts the phone to his ear and hears Dean's voice.

DEAN (over the phone): Hiya, Crowley.

CROWLEY: Dean. It's been a long time. We should get together.

DEAN (over the phone): Sure.


EXT. GRAVEYARD IN SCOTLAND – DAY

DEAN: We'll have to do that when I get back.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

CROWLEY: Back?

DEAN (over the phone): Yeah.


EXT. GRAVEYARD IN SCOTLAND – DAY

DEAN: Me and Sam – we've gone international. In fact, we're in your neck of the woods. (As Dean speaks we see the scenery and the boys by an open grave.)


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Crowley looks upset.


EXT. GRAVEYARD IN SCOTLAND – DAY

DEAN: Did you really use to wear a skirt?


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

CROWLEY: A kilt. I had very athletic calves. What's the game?

DEAN (over the phone): Dominoes.


EXT. GRAVEYARD IN SCOTLAND – DAY

DEAN: In fact we just dug yours up.

Sam and Dean are looking down at a pile of bones.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

CROWLEY: (to Bobby) This is ridiculous. The whole burning bones thing – it's a myth.

BOBBY: I know an employee of yours who would disagree.


FLASHBACK to the scene with the Crossroads Demon from earlier in the episode.

CROSSROADS DEMON: What's that?

BOBBY: You don't recognize them? They're yours. (inside a bag are human bones)

Bobby burns the bones and the Crossroads Demon burns up in her chair.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

CROWLEY: That's where she got to.

BOBBY: You demons. You think you're something special. But you're just spirits. Twisted, perverted, evil spirits. But, end of the day, you're nothing but ghosts with an ego. (Crowley has his jaw set) We torch your bones, you go up in flames.

DEAN (over the phone, clicking lighter) You hear that, Crowley?

Crowley looks down at the phone.


EXT. GRAVEYARD IN SCOTLAND – DAY

DEAN: That's me flicking my Bic for you.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Your bones for my soul. Going once… (sound of Dean playing with the lighter)


EXT. GRAVEYARD IN SCOTLAND – DAY

Dean is flicking the lighter, listening.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: (hears Dean playing with the lighter) Going twice.

Crowley tosses the phone to the ground.

CROWLEY: (exasperated) Bollocks.

Crowley raises his hand palm to reveal the contract on Bobby's arms, he then turns his hand over and in a wiping motion begins to erase the contract.

BOBBY: You can go ahead and leave in the part about my legs.

Crowley rolls his eyes, but does as he is told. The rest of the contract disappears.

BOBBY: Pleasure doing business with you.

CROWLEY: Now if you don't mind. (Crowley's gaze goes up to the devil's trap over his head)


EXT. GRAVEYARD IN SCOTLAND – DAY

Sam and Dean are still standing over Crowley's bones. Crowley appears behind them carrying a bag.

CROWLEY: I believe (Sam and Dean turn at Crowley's voice) those are mine.

DEAN: You know, now that I think about it, maybe I'll just (clicks lighter) napalm your ass anyhow.

Crowley just looks at Dean as Sam extinguishes the flame of the lighter in Dean's hand.

SAM: Dean, he's a dick, but a deal’s a deal.

Crowley walks past the boys.

CROWLEY: (to Sam) I don't need you fight my battles for me, Moose. Get bent.

Crowley inspects the bones as he puts them in the bag, then rises to look at Sam and Dean.

CROWLEY: Now, if you'll excuse me. I've a little hell to raise.

Crowley disappears and the camera pans out to the Scottish landscape.


EXT. ROAD IN SCOTLAND – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): I appreciate you boys lending a hand.

DEAN: Hey, any time we get to punk Crowley works for us.

SAM: Yeah.

BOBBY: Still, knowing how much you love flying the friendly skies –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: I guess a nine hour plane trip was no picnic.


EXT. ROAD IN SCOTLAND – NIGHT

BOBBY: What did you do, drink your way through it?

DEAN: I was fine.

SAM: No, he white knuckled his way through four puke bags.

DEAN: But at least I was sober. If some nutjob decided to try something, I was ready. I had a fork.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: (laughs) Listen. Um – about the things I said earlier. I was in a tough spot and I – I guess I was –

SAM (over the phone): You were right, Bobby.


EXT. ROAD IN SCOTLAND – NIGHT

SAM: We take you for granted.

DEAN: You've been cleaning up our messes for years, Bobby. Without you, I don't even want to think about where me and Sam would’ve ended up.

Sam nods in agreement.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby is silent for a moment.

BOBBY: Okay then, let’s roll credits on this chick flick.


EXT. ROAD IN SCOTLAND – NIGHT

BOBBY (over the phone): You boys have a safe flight. And, uh –


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY: Try some of the local grub, I hear it's... exotic.


EXT. ROAD IN SCOTLAND – NIGHT

DEAN: Oh yeah, no, definitely. We are. I hear they have an olive garden.

Sam looks at Dean.


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby rolls his eyes and hangs up the phone.


EXT. ROAD IN SCOTLAND – NIGHT

Sam tries to hang up the phone, but the car is so small he honks the horn (Dean is driving).


INT. BOBBY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Bobby has actually cut a piece of the cobbler and sits down. As Bobby gets ready to take a bite, the phone rings. Bobby puts down the fork and the plate as he gets up to answer the phone.

BOBBY: Willis. (listens to the other person) Yeah, he is. One of our best agents, in fact.
