TEASER
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
BOBBY is walking through the house, flashlight in hand, looking around. The wind is whistling outside. Bobby hears a sound and turns around, but there's nothing there. He looks a bit worried.

When he reaches the doors to the kitchen he slowly slides them open, and takes a few steps in. He scans the room and suddenly we hear a WOMAN scream and she attacks him. He falls to the floor with her on top of him and she struggles with him, pulling him back and forth, while she's still screaming. The scene is flashing confusingly for a few seconds.

The screen flashes white a few times and then...



INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

BOBBY is asleep on a bed. It's daytime. The door is being opened from the outside and a maid enters the room. After a few steps she sees BOBBY on the bed, who hasn't reacted to the noises she's made.

MAID
Oh! I'm sorry.

She begins to walk out again, but as she retrieves the keys from the door, and BOBBY still hasn't moved, she looks a bit worried.

MAID
Sir?

Since he's still not moving, she leaves the keys in the door and walks over the his bed. She touches him on the shoulder.

MAID
Wake up.

He doesn't react. We flash back to the kitchen where the woman is still screaming and BOBBY is trying to survive the attack. She is slamming his head against the floor.

We flash to his bed where the MAID now has grabbed his shoulders, shaking him, trying to wake him up. The previous scene and the one we're flashing to seems to be a dream.

MAID
Wake up, do you hear me? Wake up. Sir, wake up!

She turns around to the door, panicked.

MAID
Help! I need some help in here!

ACT ONE
INT. BAR - DAY

(MUSIC: Doobie Brothers, "Long Train Runnin'")

We open to the bartender turning around, with a bottle in his hand, to a man and a woman. He grabs a glass and walks down the bar.

MAN
Cheers!

As the camera moves towards the bartender, he's pouring up a drink and we notice SAM is sitting in the background nursing a drink. We cut to him as he's tilting his glass back and forth slowly, almost spilling out the contents. He's looking sad and all the hope we usually see in him is gone. He also appears a bit drunk. The door opens behind him and DEAN walks in. When he sees SAM he walks over, brows furrowed.

DEAN
There you are. What are you doing?

SAM turns to him.

SAM (shrugs)
Having a drink.

DEAN
It's two in the afternoon. You're drinking whiskey?

SAM
I drink whiskey all the time.

DEAN
No, you don't.

SAM
What's the big deal? You get sloppy in bars, you hit on chicks all the time. Why can't I?

DEAN looks around and we see that there's not many people in the bar; just the one woman by the bar, who's quite a bit older than SAM.

DEAN
It's kind of slim pickings around here.
(he turns back to SAM)
What's going on with you?

SAM shakes his head, and doesn't say anything for a few moments. He looks completely lost.

SAM
I tried, Dean.

DEAN looks a bit confused.

DEAN
To do what?

SAM
To save you.

DEAN looks like, all right this is going to take a while, and pulls up a stool to sit down next to SAM.

DEAN
(to bartender)
Can I get a whiskey? Double, neat.

SAM
I'm serious, Dean.

DEAN
No, you're drunk.

SAM
I mean, where you're going... what you're gonna become.
(He looks close to tears)
(scoffs, shakes his head)
I can't stop it.
(beat)
I'm starting to think maybe even Ruby can't stop it. But really, the thing is, no one can save you.

DEAN
What I've been telling you.

SAM
No, that's not what I mean. I mean, no one can save you, because you don't wanna be saved. (pause) I mean, how can you care so little about yourself?

DEAN takes in all this, and scoffs, and smiles a little.

SAM (cotinues)
What's wrong with you?

DEAN looks over to meet SAM's eyes, but before they get a chance to say anything else, DEAN's cell rings.

DEAN
Hello?
(...)
Yes, this is Mr. Snyderson.
(...)
(he looks surprised)
What?
(...)
(he looks over at SAM)
Where?



EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
The IMPALA is going down the road, quickly, past the camera.


INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
BOBBY is lying in a bed and as the camera moves up, we see DEAN and SAM standing next to his bed.

SAM
So, what's the diagnosis?

DOCTOR
We've texted everything we can think to test. He seems perfectly healthy.

DEAN
Except that he's comatose.


DOCTOR
Mr. Snyderson, you're his emergency contact. Anything we should know? Any illnesses?

DEAN
No, he-he never gets sick. I mean, he doesn't even catch cold.

SAM
Doctor, is there anything you can do?

DOCTOR
Look, I'm sorry, but we don't know what's causing it... so we don't know how to treat it. He just... went to sleep, and didn't wake up.

DEAN and SAM share a look and then they look over at BOBBY.



INT. MOTEL ROOM

SAM and DEAN enters the room, which is the one we saw BOBBY in before.

SAM
So, what was Bobby doing in Pittsburgh?

DEAN
Unless he's taking an extremely lame vacation...

He closes the door as they walk into the center of the room.

SAM
I mean, he must have been working a job, right?

They continue to walk around the room.

DEAN
Well, you think there'd be some sort of sign of something, you know?

SAM opens a drawer, but it's empty. DEAN does the same, and that too is empty. The room looks completely clean.

DEAN (continues)
Research, news clippings...

SAM turns to the closet.

DEAN
Or a frigging pizza box or a beer can.

DEAN walks away from the dresser he was looking in, and SAM walks over to the closet. We see that BOBBY's clothes are hanging there. He turns on the light and DEAN turns around to him.

SAM
How 'bout this?

SAM moves the clothes out of the way and on the wall behind them hangs all of the news clippings, maps and pictures they were looking for. there's pictures of roots, mushrooms, seeds and a map where BOBBY has written "Pittsburgh" in big letters and underlined it. There's post-its with addresses and numbers. There's a piece of paper about a plant.

DEAN
(chuckles)
Good old Bobby, always covering up his tracks.

SAM
You make heads or tails of any of this?

DEAN takes one of the papers about a plant and reads the title of it.

DEAN
"Silene capensis", which of course means absolutely nothing to me.

SAM
Here. Obit.

He takes a newspaper clipping and reads from it as he skims it.

SAM
"Dr. Walter Gregg, 64, university neurologist."

DEAN
How'd he bite it?

SAM
Um.. actually, they don't know. They say he just went to sleep and didn't wake up.

DEAN takes the clipping from him, reading it himself.

DEAN
That sound familiar to you?

SAM
All right, um... So let's say Bobby was looking into the doc's death. You know, hunting after something-

DEAN looks up at him.

DEAN
–that started hunting him.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
All right, stay here. See if you can make heads or tails of this.

He points to the closet.

SAM
What are you gonna do?

DEAN
I'm gonna look into the good doctor myself.

He walks to the door.


INT. DR. GREGG'S OFFICE
Books and boxes are cluttered over the office, ready to be packed up and removed. DEAN and Dr. Gregg's assistant comes in.

DEAN
So you're Dr. Gregg's lab assistant?

SANDERS
That's right.

DEAN
Well, his death must have come as a shock to you.

SANDERS
Yeah, it did.

DEAN looks around the office, while SANDERS stands behind him.

SANDERS
But, still, go in your sleep, peaceful... That's what you wish for, right?

DEAN
Yeah. Right.

DEAN looks at a book on the doctor's desk.

DEAN
Dr. Gregg uh.. studied sleeping disorders? Dreams?

He picks up the book and holds it up for SANDERS.

SANDERS
I don't understand. I went over all of this with the other detective.

DEAN puts down the book and looks at her, curious.

DEAN
You already spoke to another detective?

SANDERS
Yes. A very nice older man with a beard.

DEAN
Well, I'd love to hear it again if you don't mind.

SANDERS
Thing is, I'm sort of busy. Maybe we could do this later?

DEAN
Sure. Yeah. Just bring you down to the station later this afternoon,
(her face falls)
and get your statement on tape, do it all official-like.

SANDERS
Look, okay, I didn't know about Dr. Gregg's experiments. Not until I was cleaning out his files.

DEAN
(confused)
His experiments, uh...? The ones he was conducting on ... sleeping?

SANDERS
No one knew, okay? Not the university, not anybody. I already spoke with a lawyer and he told me I can't be held liable for anything.

DEAN
Maybe you couldn't, but that was before the new evidence came to light.

SANDERS
New evidence?

DEAN
Mm-hm.

SANDERS
What new evidence?

DEAN
(thinks quickly) I'm not at liberty to say.

SANDERS
(sighs, most likely feeling screwed)
Look, I'm just a grad student. This was a gig to cover tuition.

DEAN
Maybe so. But, uh, still, this- this... this could go on your permanent record. Unless you hand over the doctor's research to me. All of it.



As the scene transitions we hear knocking on a door.



INT. JEREMY FROST RESIDENCE

DEAN holds up his badge, that states he's a detective for Pittsburgh police department. JEREMY moves away from the door so DEAN can come in.

JEREMY
Look, I don't know what the RA said, but, ah, I was growing ferns.

DEAN walks in.

DEAN
(chuckles)
Take it easy, Phish, that's not why I'm here.

JEREMY
Really?

DEAN turns around to him. He's got a file in his hands.

JEREMY
(relieved)
Oh, thank God. Okay.

DEAN
I wanna talk to you about Dr. Gregg's sleep study.

JEREMY
Yeah. Dr. Gregg just died, right?

DEAN
You were one of his test subjects, right?

JEREMY
Yeah.

JEREMY opens his fridge and takes out two beers. He holds them up a bit, motioning as a question. He then holds one out to DEAN.

JEREMY
Unless you're on ... duty or, whatever?

DEAN looks to the door for a second, and then decides to go for the beer.

DEAN
I guess I can make an exception.

DEAN takes the bottle and JEREMY grabs the bottle opener. He opens his bottle as DEAN opens his. They lift their beers to each other and then both take a swig. DEAN closes his eyes as he takes in the beer, enjoying the taste. He gives a small smile before continuing with the interview.

DEAN
Now, Dr. Gregg was testing treatments for a, uh, "Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome"? Which means...?

JEREMY
Um.. I, uh.. I can't dream.

DEAN makes a "huh" face.

JEREMY
I had this bike accident when I was a kid and banged my head pretty good and I haven't had a dream since. Till the study. You know. Sort of.

DEAN
What'd the doc give you?

JEREMY
It's this yellow tea. It.. it smelled awful, tasted worse.

DEAN
What did it do?

JEREMY
Just passed right out. And uh, I had the most vivid, super-intense dream. Like a bad acid trip, you know?

DEAN
(forgets he's in character)
Totally.
(remembers his role)
I mean, no.

JEREMY
That was it. I dropped out of the study right after that. I didn't... like it. To tell you the truth... it kind of scared me.

DEAN looks at him, thoughtful.




INT. HOSPITAL
DEAN is sitting by BOBBY's bed, looking at him, thoughtful. SAM enters after a few seconds. DEAN becomes aware of something, and turns around to see SAM. They share a look before SAM walks further into the room.

SAM
How is he?

DEAN rubs his hand over his chin as he turns back to BOBBY. SAM walks to stand by the foot of the bed. He's got files in his hand.

DEAN
No change. What you got?

He gets up and walks over to SAM, to see what he brought with him.

SAM
Well, considering what you told me about the doc's experiments..
(he sighs)
..Bobby's wall is starting to make a hell of a lot more sense.

DEAN
How so?

SAM holds up a picture of a plant from the folder.

SAM
This plant, Silene capensis, is also known as African Dream Root? It's been used by shaman and medicine men for centuries.

DEAN
Let me guess. They dose up, bust out the didgeridoos, start kicking around the hackey.

SAM
Not quite. If you believe the legends, it's used for dreamwalking. I mean, entering another person's dreams, poking around in their heads.

DEAN
I take it we believe the legends

They share a look.

SAM
When don't we? But dreamwalking is just the tip of the iceberg.

They pick up a paper from the folder that contains info on the root and a drawing of it.

DEAN
What do you mean?

SAM
I mean, this Dream Root is some serious mojo. You take enough of it, with practice, you can become a regular Freddy Krueger.

The camera pans up on BOBBY.

SAM
You can control anything. You could turn bad dreams good, you could turn good dreams bad.

DEAN
And killing people in their sleep?

SAM nods.

SAM
For example.

DEAN sighs.

SAM
So let's say uh, let's say this doc was testing this stuff on his patients, Tim Leary-style.

DEAN
Somebody gets pissed at him, decides to give him a little dream visit, he goes nighty-night.

SAM
But what about Bobby?

He looks over at him and the camera cuts to him, zooming in slowly on his face.

SAM
I mean, if the killer came after him, how come he's still alive?

DEAN
I don't know.

The camera zooms in on BOBBY and the screen flashes in white.



INT. HOUSE; DREAM
We're back in the house BOBBY was dreaming about in the beginning. He's holding a door closed as the woman is banging on it, making it rattle. She continues to scream and BOBBY's panting, scared. He looks around for something to hold the door, and grabs an old suitcase. He desperately grabs around the space, which now reveals itself to be a closet, for anything to hold the door. He grabs a broom and holds his back to the door, trying to keep it closed.

BOBBY
(screaming)
Help me! Somebody help me!

The camera was on his face as he screamed and it now zooms out and reveals that the closet is gone and it's just a very long hallway. The camera zooms out faster and faster.

BOBBY
HEEEELP MEEEEE!

The screen flashes.



INT. HOSPITAL

We zoom in on BOBBY in the hospital bed.


ACT TWO
INT. HOSPITAL; HALLWAY
SAM and DEAN comes out through a door, probably just leaving BOBBY's room. They walk the hallway.

DEAN
So how do we find our homicidal sandman?

SAM
Could be anyone.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Anyone who knew the doctor, had access to his dream shrooms.

SAM
Maybe one of his test subjects or something?

DEAN
Possible. But his research was pretty sketchy. I mean.. I don't know how many subjects he had, or who all of them were.

SAM scoffs and DEAN looks at him.

DEAN
What?

SAM
(loud sigh)
In any other case, we'd be calling Bobby and asking him for help right now.

DEAN looks like he just thought of something. He grabs SAM by his arm to stop him and he looks up at him.

DEAN
You know what? You're right.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Let's go talk to him.

SAM
(a little confused)
Sure. I think we might find the conversation a bit one-sided.

DEAN
Not if we're tripping on some Dream Root.

SAM
What?

DEAN
You heard me.

SAM
You wanna go dreamwalking inside Bobby's head?

DEAN
Yeah. Why not? Maybe we could help.

SAM
We have no idea what's crawling around in there.

DEAN
Well how bad could it be?

SAM
Bad.

DEAN
Dude, it's Bobby.

SAM
(considers) Yeah, you're right.
(scoffs) One problem though. We're fresh out of African Dream Root, so unless you know someone who can score some ...

DEAN
Crap.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Bela.

SAM
Bela? Crap.
(scoffs) You're actually suggesting we ask her a favor?

DEAN
I'm feeling dirty just thinking about it, but yeah.

DEAN starts walking again. SAM sighs and walks after him.


DEAN walks away. SAM doesn't move for a moment. He sighs and then follows.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
SAM is sitting doing research on his laptop when a knock on the door sounds. SAM closes the lid on the computer, sighs and then walks over to the door. He cautiously only opens it a few inches and then when he sees who it is, sighs, and opens it up completely, holding it open. BELA walks in in a trenchcoat.

BELA
Hey, Sam.

SAM closes the door as BELA stops in the room, turns around, and then faces him.

SAM
(annoyed)
Bela, I didn't think there's a chance in hell you'd show up.

He stands across from her, putting his hands on his hips. She just smiles at him.

BELA
Well, I'm full of surprises. Though, truthfully...

She takes hold of the belt of her trenchcoat, and advances slowly towards SAM.

BELA
You wanna know why I'm here?

SAM takes a few steps back as BELA comes up in front of him.

SAM
Okay.

She opens and takes off her coat, revealing the top of a lacy slip or bra – she's not wearing a shirt, and although the camera doesn't show it, we can imagine that she's not wearing pants either.

BELA
Because of you.

SAM looks to the side, unsure and a bit embarrassed, as the coat falls to the floor, revealing that she's wearing a slip.

SAM
Uh.. What are you doing?

He looks down at her and she puts her hand on his cheek, her eyes on his lips.

BELA
I can't stop thinking about you.

SAM
(confused)
What?

She leans in and kisses him. He responds and puts his hand on her arm. They breath in with the kiss and she puts her other hand on his waist.

SAM
Are you sure?

The scene cuts to the bed where SAM lands on his back with BELA on top as they continue to kiss. They roll over as BELA moans and SAM ends up on top of her. The camera cuts between her every word to her holding her head in different angles, enjoying SAM.

BELA
Mmmm.... Sam. Sam. Sam. Oh!

DEAN (V.O)
Sam! Wake up.


CUT TO:

In the foreground, SAM is sitting at the desk, sleeping bent over with his head on his arm. Drool covers his hand and he's got a smile on his face. In the background, DEAN is sitting in a chair, looking up at SAM and holding papers that he'd apparently been reading through. SAM smiles a little more and then realizes it was just a dream. His smile disappears and he sits up, wiping his face with the back of his hand. The same hand he had drool on, which he discovers. DEAN chuckles, watching him. He wipes his face with his other arm.

DEAN
Dude, you were out. And making some serious happy noises.

SAM looks very uncomfortable and doesn't look over at DEAN.

DEAN
Who were you dreaming about?

SAM
What? No one. Nothing.

DEAN
C'mon, you can tell me. Angelina Jolie?

SAM
No.

DEAN
Brad Pitt?

SAM turns around, almost looking at him.

SAM
No. No! Dude, it doesn't matter.

DEAN
Whatever.

SAM
(to himself)
Whatever.

DEAN
I called Bela.

SAM gets still at this, a smile quickly flashes by. Trying to cover his voice when answering.

SAM (awkwardly, embarrassed)
Bela? Yeah? She- What'd she.. you know, say? She.. gonna.. help us?

DEAN
Shockingly, no, which puts us back to square one. I've been trying to decipher the doctor's notes. Unfortunately, he has worse handwriting than you do.

SAM is still in his chair, back to DEAN, looking around a little.

DEAN
You gonna come help me with this stuff?

DEAN looks over at him. SAM looks around, and then down to his lap. He shifts uncomfortably and looks up, still keeping his back to DEAN.

SAM
Yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec.

He moves around a bit in his seat, stretching. Suddenly a knock on the door sounds. They both turn in its direction. SAM stays in his chair as DEAN gets up to open the door. DEAN opens the door just inches, just like SAM did in his dream. When he sees who it is, he looks annoyed and opens up the door, walking with it.

DEAN
Bela. As I live and breathe.

SAM swallows visibly.

BELA enters, wearing a similar trenchcoat to the one in SAM's dream, only this one is black and the other one was tan. SAM reacts to her right away due to the dream, and tries to cover up his "situation".

BELA
You called me. Remember?

DEAN
I remember you turning me down.

BELA
Well, I'm just full of surprises.

BELA turns to SAM, who is still in the chair. He lifts one hand at her, waving awkwardly over his shoulder, staying half-turned away from her with his other hand in his lap. He doesn't look her in the eyes.

SAM
Hey, Bela. What's going on?

DEAN looks from her to SAM, and she just continues on.

BELA
I brought you your African Dream Root.

She hands over a jar of it to DEAN.

BELA
Nasty stuff, and not easy to come by.

She puts her bag on the TV and starts to open her coat, with her back to SAM. SAM sits up, alertly, breathing in anticipation ...

DEAN
Why the sudden change of heart?

BELA
What? I can't do you a little favor every now and again?

SAM tenses up in anticipation as her coat slips off ....

DEAN
No. You can't.

The coat falls away and reveals her in a regular long-sleeved blue shirt, and not as naked as SAM had been half-anticipating. He lets out a breath silently, visibly relaxing a bit more.

DEAN
Come on, I wanna know what the strings are before you attach them.

BELA
You said this was for Bobby Singer, right?

DEAN nods.

BELA
Well, I'm doing it for him. Not you.

DEAN
Bobby? Why?

BELA
He saved my life once.
(beat)
In Flagstaff.

DEAN throws a look SAM's way and SAM just shrugs. He looks back at her, still not responding to her statement.

BELA
I screwed up and he saved me, okay? You satisfied?

DEAN
Maybe.

She looks at DEAN, who's now looking at the jar, and at SAM.

BELA
So when do we go on this little magical mystery tour?

DEAN
Oh, you're not going anywhere. I don't trust you enough to let you in my car, much less Bobby's head. No offense.

SAM looks a bit disappointed. DEAN walks over to the closet. He turns on the lights and opens up the safe, where the Colt is, and he puts in the jar of Dream Root with it. BELA and SAM watch him.

BELA
None taken.

SAM looks up at her quickly and DEAN closes the safe, locking it. He walks into the room again, where BELA is looking a bit annoyed now.

BELA
It's 2 am. Where am I supposed to go?

DEAN
Get a room. Ah, they got the Magic Fingers, a little Casa Erotica on pay-per-view. You'll love it.

BELA
You...

She takes her bag in a huff and walks to the door, retrieving her coat on the way. SAM jumps out of his chair calling after her.

SAM
Nice to see-.. Seeing you...

She slams the door behind her, ignoring him.

SAM
... Bela.

DEAN who was smiling after her, takes that in and he turns to SAM, a bit confused.




CUT TO
LATER
SAM walks over to the beds with two glass cups of the liquid containing the Dream Root. DEAN is sitting on the bed, waiting for him. As SAM comes over, he hands DEAN one of the cups and then sits down on the other bed.

DEAN
Uh, should we dim the lights and synch up Wizard of Oz to Dark Side of the Moon?

SAM looks over at him, with a smile.

SAM
Why?

DEAN looks at him, disappointed.

DEAN
What did you do during college?

SAM looks at him with his usual "huh" reaction to such questions. DEAN goes to drink the liquid but SAM stops him.

SAM
Wait, wait, wait. Whew. Can't forget this.

DEAN puts down the cup and looks over at him as he pulls out a little envelope from his shirt pocket. He pulls something out and as DEAN reaches out his hand, he puts it in it.

SAM
Here.

DEAN
What the hell is that?

SAM
Bobby's hair.

DEAN
We have to drink Bobby's hair?

SAM
That's how you control whose dream you're entering. You gotta ... drink some of their uh... some of their body.

DEAN
Well, guess the hair of the dog is better than other parts of the body.

They put it in and SAM exhales, getting ready to drink what seems to be a very disgusting drink. They both raise their cups a bit.

DEAN
Bottoms up.

SAM
Yeah.

They clink their cups together in a toast and then drinks it all up. They both grunt, trying to swallow, which seems to be a little hard. They smack their mouths a bit, due to the awful taste. They look quite disgusted and nothing seems to have changed.

DEAN
Feel anything?

SAM
No. You feel anything?

>SAM looks over at him as he shakes his head a little.

DEAN
No.

He holds up the cup and looks in it.

DEAN
Maybe we got some bad shwag.

We hear thunder from outside and rain pattering on the window. SAM looks over, a little confused.

SAM
Hey, when did it start raining?

DEAN looks over at the window as well. He gets up and walks slowly to the window, drawing open the white curtain liners. The rain is actually not coming from the sky, but from the ground.

DEAN
When did it start raining upside down?

He turns around to SAM and as the camera follows his movement all the colors seems to have drained and we see that they're now standing in the same house that BOBBY was dreaming about. They looks around a bit and as the camera changes angle, we see that the window DEAN was just looking out through, is gone and instead there's a fireplace. The entire motel room has turned into a living room.

DEAN
Okay, I don't know what's weirder – the fact that we're in Bobby's head ... or that he's dreaming of Better Homes and Gardens.

DEAN is looking at SAM while he just looks around the room a bit more.

SAM
Wait. Wait a sec. Imagine the place, uh, without the paint job. (SAM begins gesturing to everything he's talking about.) More cluttered, dusty, books all over the place.

They begin to move around the living room. We get a shot through the window from outside, as if someone's watching them.

DEAN
It's Bobby's house.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
(calling out)
Bobby?!

As SAM walks to the opening of the living room, by the stairs, he feels someone watching him. He turns around and we get a shot through the window again and the camera moves to the side, as if someone's hiding to not be seen by him. SAM keeps watching and we get a shot of the windows from his angle and then we see from the outside again, the person behind the camera is still hiding, but watching him through the curtains. SAM finally turns back around and walks slowly to the stairs and the person watching outside moves to get a better view again. SAM looks up towards the top of the stairs.

SAM
(whispering)
Bobby?

SAM looks towards the door, while DEAN is still in the living room.

SAM
Dean?

DEAN turns around to SAM.

SAM
I'm gonna go look outside.

DEAN
(whispering)
No, no, no, stay close.

SAM
Dude, I'll be fine. Just, look around in here. Look, we gotta find him.

DEAN
Don't do anything stupid.

SAM nods and walks to the door. The windows show that it's still raining outside.


EXT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM - DAY

SAM is coming out of the door he just opened, and now – instead of a dark rainy, color-drained day, we see everything in bright technicolor and the sun is shining. The house is bright blue, with flowers all around, and birds chirping can be heard. SAM walks out on the porch, a confused look on his face. We pan over the yard, and down to BOBBY's car, that looks completely new (same car as used in "The Magnificent Seven") and we pan up the walkway, which is well-manicured, and neatly lined with all kinds of bright, beautiful flowers, to SAM. While SAM takes this in, the door suddenly slams shut behind him. SAM turns around at the sound and goes back and tries to open it but it's locked.

SAM
Dean!

He walks over to the window next to the door and bangs on the wall while looking in.

SAM
Dean!

We see DEAN through the window, still looking around the house with his back to SAM, but he doesn't seem to react to neither SAM calling his name or him banging on the wall.

SAM walks down the porch out of view.



INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM
DEAN open the doors to the kitchen, where we saw BOBBY at the beginning of the episode. He walks in, looking around cautiously. He moves through the kitchen towards the hallway on the other side.

DEAN
Bobby?

He walks out into the hallway, where there's two doors. One across from the kitchen and one on the left.

DEAN
Bobby!

DEAN turns around as if he heard something and looks down the hallway in the other direction, where there's another closed door.

BOBBY's voice
(scared)
Who's out there?

DEAN turns back to the door that was on his left when he entered the hallway. He walks over to the door and we see long scratchmarks on it. DEAN touches them as he goes for the doorknob.

DEAN
(whispered)
Bobby, you in there?

BOBBY
Dean?

DEAN
Yeah. It's me. Open up.

BOBBY opens the door and looks behind DEAN.

DEAN
Hey.

BOBBY moves into the kitchen, looking scared and looking around to make sure the screaming woman isn't there. He has scratches on his cheek and nose. DEAN walks up next to him.

BOBBY
How in the hell did you find me?

DEAN
Sam and I got our hands on some of that Dream Root stuff.

BOBBY
Dream Root? What?

DEAN
Dr. Gregg, the experiments?

BOBBY, who's still looking around, throws him a glance. He's terrified.

BOBBY
What the hell are you talking about?

The lamps begin to flicker.

BOBBY
Hurry.

He runs for the closet again. DEAN turns around and grabs him, trying to figure out what's going on.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

BOBBY
She's coming.

DEAN
Okay, you know this is a dream, don't you?

BOBBY
(terrified)
What are you, crazy?

DEAN
It's a dream, Bobby! None of this is real!

We suddenly see the woman from his dreams earlier opening the door on the other side of the hallway, behind DEAN. BOBBY points to her.

BOBBY
Does that look made-up?

DEAN turns around and we see the woman coming out into the hallway. She's wearing a white dress and there's blood on it, coming from wounds on her neck and chest. Suddenly the closet door slams shut and BOBBY turns around, rattling the doorknob to make it open. DEAN looks at him and then when BOBBY turns around, DEAN looks back at the woman. We now see she looks rather normal except for the bleeding wounds on her chest and neck. Even her hair is styled in a regular fashion. She doesn't look happy though.

DEAN
Bobby, who is that?

BOBBY has tears in his eyes now, but not from being terrified.

BOBBY
She's... She's my wife.

Now her expression isn't as hard. She's just looking back at DEAN and BOBBY. DEAN looks from BOBBY to her and back again.

ACT THREE
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The boys are each lying on their beds, knocked out. DEAN even has the cup still in his hand. SAM's is on the floor between the beds and his arm is hanging above it. They're both on their backs.


EXT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM - DAY
We're in the backyard and SAM comes around the house. There's a little pond and loads of beautiful flowers. SAM walks further into the backyard, just looking around.

KAREN SINGER (V.O)
Why Bobby?


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM
KAREN SINGER
Why did you do this to me?

DEAN and BOBBY are standing in the kitchen, by the living room, and KAREN SINGER is standing in the doorway leading to the hall. At her words, BOBBY turns around.

BOBBY
I'd rather died myself than hurt you.

KAREN SINGER
But you did hurt me. You shoved that knife into me. Again and again. You watched me bleed. Watched me die.

DEAN comes up behind BOBBY and grabs hold of him.

DEAN
Bobby, she's not real.

BOBBY doesn't respond to DEAN, his eyes are on his wife.

KAREN SINGER (continues)
How could you?

BOBBY is close to crying now.

BOBBY
You were possessed, baby. You were rabid. And I didn't know what I know now. I didn't know how to save you.

KAREN SINGER
You're lying. You wanted me dead! If you'd loved me,
(screaming)
you would've found a way!

BOBBY
(small, sobbing)
I'm sorry.

DEAN grabs hold of him again, more forcefully this time.

DEAN
Come on!

DEAN drags BOBBY into the living room and as he begins to slide the doors closed, KAREN SINGER runs for the doors, screaming at them.



EXT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM
SAM is walking by a line of washed sheets, drying in the wind. When he turns around, JEREMY – Dr. Gregg's research subject – is suddenly there, swinging a bat at SAM, and hitting him hard in the chest and shoulder.



INT. MOTEL ROOM

SAM flinches from the hit that his dream-self just took.


EXT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM

SAM falls to the ground with the hit.



INT. MOTEL ROOM
The camera zooms in on SAM who continues to just be knocked out, without a reaction.


EXT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM

SAM is on the ground, holding his shoulder and JEREMY stands over him.

SAM
Who are you?

JEREMY
Who are you? You don't belong here.

SAM
You're one to talk. You're in my friend's head.

JEREMY
You got a poor choice in friends. This is self-defense. He came after me. He wanted to hurt me.

SAM
That may be because you're a killer.

JEREMY
You should be nicer to me. In here... you're just an insect. I'm a god.




INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM

KAREN SINGER is jumping and banging on the doors to the living room, screaming.

DEAN (leaning against the door, holding it closed)
I'm telling you, all of it. Your house, your wife, it's a nightmare!

DEAN is standing by the doors, keeping them closed. BOBBY is standing across from him, just looking at him. KAREN SINGER continues to bang and scream. DEAN finally grabs a wire to tie around the doorhandles.

BOBBY
(crying)
I killed her.

DEAN
Bobby! This is your dream. And you can wake up. I mean, hell, you can do anything.

He ties the doors together just as BOBBY walks up behind him.

BOBBY (despairing)
Just leave me alone. Let her kill me already.

DEAN grabs hold of him, trying to get him to wake up, to snap out it all.

DEAN
(The scene is repeating with each phrase, from both DEAN and BOBBY's perspectives, perhaps, because the cuts are slightly different from each other) Look at me.
Look at me.
You gotta snap out of this now.
You gotta snap out of this now!
You're not gonna die. I'm not gonna let you die.
I'm not gonna let you die. You're like a father to me. You gotta believe me, please.

They look at each other for a moment. BOBBY looks once at the door his wife is still banging on and screaming behind, and then he look back at DEAN.

BOBBY
I'm dreaming?

DEAN
Yes! Now take control of it.

BOBBY looks towards the door, and then he closes his eyes tightly and suddenly all the banging and screaming stops. DEAN lets go of him and walks over to the doors. He removes the cable and slides the doors open, revealing an empty kitchen. KAREN SINGER is nowhere in sight.

BOBBY
I don't believe it.

DEAN turns around and looks at him.

DEAN
(breathing heavily)
Believe it. Now would you please wake up?



EXT. BOBBY'S HOUSE; DREAM

SAM is still on the ground and JEREMY is standing over him.

JEREMY
Sweet dreams.

He raises the bat and SAM pulls up his arm to take the impact. JEREMY lifts the bat and starts to swing it down, hard.



INT. HOSPITAL

BOBBY wakes up suddenly, sitting up in bed.


INT. MOTEL ROOM

DEAN and SAM wake up with suddenly at the same time, sitting up on their beds, panting.



INT. HOSPITAL

BOBBY's panting, looking around.




INT. MOTEL ROOM

The boys are panting and DEAN looks down at his cup. They look over at each other.



INT. HOSPITAL; LATER

BOBBY is sitting in bed, looking over the papers from the investigation. DEAN is sitting on the bed next to him.

DEAN
Hey, Bobby. That, uh... That stuff, all that stuff with your wife?

BOBBY looks over at him.

DEAN
That actually happen?

BOBBY
Everybody got into hunting somehow.

DEAN
I'm sorry.

BOBBY
Don't be sorry. If it weren't for you, I'd still be lost in there. Or dead.
(beat, looking at DEAN)
Thank you.

DEAN only responds with a twitch of his lips. SAM comes in after that, seeing the guys sharing a look.

SAM
So, uh, stoner boy wasn't in his dorm. My guess is he's long gone by now.

BOBBY
He ain't much of a stoner.

He picks up a picture of JEREMY, looking at it.

DEAN
No?

BOBBY
No. His name's Jeremy Frost. Full-on genius. Hundred-and-sixty IQ. Which is sayin' some, considering his dad took a baseball bat to his head.

DEAN nods at that. BOBBY picks up another paper and hands it to SAM.

BOBBY
Here's Father of the Year.

We see that it's a copy of a drivers license for JEREMY's dad, HENRY DAVID FROST, 3123 Houset Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15122 ... DOB 12/16/1968, BRN eyes, 5'11".

BOBBY
He died before Jeremy was 10.

SAM
Looks like a real sweetheart.

BOBBY
Injury gave him Charcot-Wilbrand. He hasn't dreamt since.

SAM puts the paper back on the little side table.

DEAN
Till he started dosing the dream drug.

BOBBY
Yep.

DEAN
How'd he know how to dig up your worst nightmare and throw it at you?

BOBBY
Hey, he was rooting around in my skull. God knows what he saw in there.

SAM
Yeah. How'd he get in there in the first place? Isn't he supposed to have some of your hair, your DNA, or something?

DEAN
Yeah.

BOBBY
Yeahhhh. 'Fore I knew it was him, he offered me a beer. I drank it. (DEAN's face is showing a growing realization.) Dumbest frigging thing.

DEAN, realizing he's done the same thing tries to make it a bit lighter.

DEAN
Oh, I don't know. It wasn't that dumb.
(nervous laugh)

SAM and BOBBY both looks at him with this comment.

SAM
Dean, you didn't.

DEAN
I was thirsty?

SAM
(angry)
That's great. Now he can come after either one of you.

DEAN
Well, now we just have to find him first.

BOBBY
We better work fast ... and coffee up. Because the one thing we cannot do – is fall asleep.

The screen goes black.

ACT FOUR
SUBTITLE
Two Days Later

INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

DEAN's behind the wheel, SAM is sitting next to him. DEAN is clearly pissed over the whole situation.

DEAN
I mean, this Jeremy guy's not a friggin' ghost. Where the hell could he be?

SAM
Dean, you sure you don't want me to drive? You seem a little...

DEAN looks over at him.

SAM
... caffeinated.

DEAN (angrily)
Well, thanks for the news flash, Edison!

DEAN's cell rings. He tries to get hold of it but he fumbles, muttering indistinctly in frustration. He finally gets it in hand. The scene flashes between BOBBY in the motel room with BELA and the IMPALA.

DEAN
Tell me you got something!

BOBBY
Strip club was a bust, huh?

DEAN
Yeah.

BOBBY
That was our last lead.

DEAN
What the hell, Bobby!

BOBBY
Don't yell at me, boy. I'm working my ass off here.

DEAN
Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just.. I'm-I'm-I'm tired.

BELA is using her spirit board and tarot cards to find help from the dead.

BOBBY
Well, who ain't?

DEAN
What's Bela got?

BOBBY turns to Bela.

BOBBY
What do you got, Bela?

BELA
Sorry. Sometimes the spirit world is in a chatty mood, and sometimes it isn't.

BOBBY
(to DEAN)
She's got nothing.

DEAN
Great! Well, I'm just gonna go blow my brains out now!

He flips the phone closed and throws it in his lap. He hits the steering-wheel grunting angrily.


INT. MOTEL ROOM

BOBBY flips his phone closed and looks over at BELA, who's still working by the board. BOBBY walks over to her.

BOBBY
Let me ask you somethin'.

BELA looks up at him.

BOBBY (continues)
What are you doin' helping us?

She smiles a little.

BELA
Bobby, I'm surprised you don't remember.

BOBBY squints his eyes a little, trying to think what she means.

BELA
Flagstaff?

BOBBY looks thoughtful for a moment, not making the connection.

BOBBY
Oh. Yeah. Right. Flagstaff.

He stares off into the distance, still trying to recall.



EXT. IMPALA

The IMPALA comes down the road towards the camera. Suddenly DEAN turns the car on a side road instead of continuing on. When they get to a clearing in the woods, he shuts off the engine. The camera pans up from the headlights to the windshield and over to DEAN's window.

DEAN
All right, that's it. I'm done.

SAM
What are you doing?

DEAN slides down a bit in his seat, resting his head on the back of it.

DEAN
Taking myself a long-overdue nap.

SAM
What?! Dean, Jeremy can come after you.

DEAN
That's the idea.

SAM
Excuse me?


INT. IMPALA

DEAN
Come on man, we can't find him, so let him come to me.

SAM
On his own turf? Where he's basically a god?

DEAN
I can handle it.

SAM
Not alone, you can't.

He reaches over and pulls out some of DEAN's hair.

DEAN
Ow!

He touches his head where SAM grabbed some hair. He looks over at SAM.

DEAN
What are you doing?

SAM (fiddling with DEAN's hairs)
Comin' in with you.

DEAN
No, you're not.

SAM
Why not? At least then it'll be two against one.

DEAN doesn't have a response first, opening and closing his mouth.

DEAN
'Cause I don't want you digging around in my head.

SAM
Too bad.

SAM goes for the items to make the liquid and DEAN just looks at him for a moment.


CUT TO: LATER

They're both asleep, leaning on the doors of the IMPALA. SAM wakes up first, clearing his throat. The car is right where it was before we cut to after they fell asleep.

SAM
Dean.

SAM hits DEAN on his arm and DEAN wakes up forcefully.

DEAN
Jeez. (waking up) For the love of God.

DEAN looks around a bit, looking extremely tired.

DEAN (continues)
What are we still doing here?

>SAM
I have no idea.

A sound can be heard from outside the car.

SAM
There's someone out there.


EXT. IMPALA

They get out of the car, looking around. As they walk in front of the car, music can suddenly be heard. DEAN looks behind him and then when he turns around, a corner of the clearing lights up, and there sits LISA BRAEDEN (from episode "The Kids Are Alright") on a little blanket and a picnic basket. DEAN just looks at her and she smiles up at him. (MUSIC starts playing: "Dream a Little Dream of Me" by the Mamas and Papas, with an echo reverb)

LISA
Hey. You gonna sit down?

DEAN doesn't move, he just looks at her. She has a glass of red whine in her hand and she reaches for another glass in the basket.

LISA
Come on. We only have an hour before we have to pick Ben up from baseball.

She holds the glass for him, giving him another smile. SAM is standing a bit behind DEAN, taking this all in as DEAN just looks at her. He looks over at SAM.

DEAN
I've never had this dream before.

He turns back, away from SAM, and we can see that he isn't telling the truth. In the background, SAM takes a few steps towards him.

DEAN (to SAM)
Stop looking at me like that.

SAM
Sorry.

LISA
Dean. I love you.

She smiles and suddenly her entire scene shakes and both her, the picnic, the light and the music disappears. DEAN looks around, SAM turns around, doing the same.

DEAN
Where'd she go?

SAM is looking into the woods and suddenly JEREMY comes out from behind a tree.

SAM
Dean.

SAM takes after JEREMY, who runs off. DEAN quickly follows SAM and they run into the woods. DEAN loses track of SAM, but keeps running in the same direction. Suddenly he stops and turns, looking around confused.

DEAN
Okay.

The camera pans out and reveals that the woods have turned into wallpaper and DEAN is standing in a hallway with doors on both sides.



EXT. WOODS; DREAM

SAM is still running through the woods, in pursuit of JEREMY. He comes to a clearing, where he stops, panting, looking around.

SAM
Dean?!


INT. HALLWAY; DREAM

DEAN is walking down the hallway towards a door at the end of it. Before he reaches it, it suddenly opens up slowly. DEAN stops, watching. The door glides open more, revealing a motel room.


INT. MOTEL ROOM; DREAM

Clicking can be heard, as DEAN enters the room. As he comes in, we see that the motel room looks exactly as the one he and SAM have been staying in. Across the room from the door, sits a man on the chair by the desk. DEAN walks further into the room, watching him.

DEAN
Jeremy?

The man keeps clicking the on and off button for the lamp on the desk, his back to DEAN. When we get an angle over the mans shoulder, he clicks the lamp back on and we see that it's.. DEAN. He turns his head back towards DEAN, and he doesn't look very nice. DEAN sees that the man is himself. DREAM DEAN slowly stands up, and turns to DEAN, who swallows at the sight of himself. DREAM DEAN doesn't looks so hard anymore.

DREAM DEAN
Hey, Dean.

DEAN
Well, aren't you a handsome son of a gun.

He smiles.

DREAM DEAN
We need to talk.

DEAN nods and begins to walk in a circle, as does DREAM DEAN. They're walking in the same direction just across from each other.

DEAN (nodding)
I get it. I get it. I'm my own worst nightmare, is that it? Huh? Kind of like the Superman III junkyard scene? A little mano y mano with myself?

DREAM DEAN
Joke all you want, smart-ass. But you can't lie to me. I know the truth.

They stop walking, now having changed places. DEAN standing by the desk, DREAM DEAN by the door.

DREAM DEAN
I know how dead you are inside. How worthless you feel. I know how you look into a mirror... and hate what you see.

DEAN (swallows, gets ahold of himself)
Sorry, pal. It's not gonna work. (smiling)
You're not real.

DREAM DEAN
Sure I am. I'm you.

DEAN
I don't think so. 'Cause see, this is my siesta. Not yours.
(raises left hand)
All I gotta do is snap my fingers and you go bye-bye.

He snaps his fingers once, and nothing happens. DEAN's smile fades, and he snaps again, noticing nothing's happening. DREAM DEAN just watches him. DEAN snaps them three more times and then lets his hand fall to his side, eyebrows lifted. DREAM DEAN gives him an I-told-you-so nod.

DREAM DEAN
I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you.

The door slams shut behind him, and locks. All the smiles are gone from DEAN's features; he's completely serious.

DREAM DEAN
Like I said...

DREAM DEAN raises his right hand, in which he is now holding a sawed-off shotgun.

DREAM DEAN (continues)
... we need to talk.


INT. IMPALA

A bang can be heard, and SAM wakes up, gasping. He looks over at DEAN, who's still asleep.

SAM
Dean.

SAM hits him on the arm and the camera pans from SAM to in front of DEAN.

SAM
Hey.

As the camera reaches DEAN's face, we see it's in fact not DEAN, but JEREMY, who's very much awake.

SAM
Wake up.

He hits him on the arm two more times and then JEREMY turns around, with a hard, evil look. SAM only has a second to respond and take in that it's JEREMY and not DEAN, and then JEREMY hits him hard in his stomach with the tip of the bat he used earlier in BOBBY's DREAM. SAM grunts and opens the door.


EXT. IMPALA; DREAM

SAM falls out through the door, face first, still grunting over the pain. JEREMY comes around the front of the car, the bat resting against his shoulder.

JEREMY
Boy, you just don't know when to leave well enough alone, do you?

As he walks towards SAM, who's reached the back of the IMPALA still on the ground, he closes the door SAM fell out through and continues walking up to him. Towering over SAM who's now turned over, looking up at him, still moving backwards.

SAM (pained voice)
You're a psycho.

JEREMY
You're wrong.

SAM
Yeah? Tell that to Dr. Gregg.

JEREMY
The doc? No, no. The doc's the one that got me hooked on this stuff and then he took it away.

SAM is lying still on the ground, looking up at him. He leans on the IMPALA, raising the bat, holding it like he's about to swing, looking down at SAM.

JEREMY
But I needed it, and he wouldn't let me have it.

SAM
So you killed him?

JEREMY
I can dream again. You know what that's like, not to be able to dream? You never rest, not really. It's like being awake for 15 years.

SAM
And let me guess. That makes you go crazy?

JEREMY leans down towards SAM, holding the bat out at him.

JEREMY
I just wanna be left alone. I just wanna dream.

SAM
Sorry. Can't do that.

JEREMY
That's the wrong answer.

SAM is suddenly pulled flat against the ground. He groans and gasps heavily. As we get a shot from the side, we see that SAM's now tied to railroad spikes, unable to move.

JEREMY
I'm getting better and better at this. Stronger and stronger all the time.

He's still standing by SAM's feet, now examining the bat. SAM looks to the side, and JEREMY looks down at him.

JEREMY
But you and your brother? You're not waking up. Not this time. I'm not gonna let you.

SAM looks up at him.



INT. MOTEL ROOM; DREAM

DREAM DEAN (V.O)
I mean, you're going to hell and you won't lift a finger to stop it.

DEAN and DREAM DEAN has begun circling each other again.

DREAM DEAN
Talk about low self-esteem.
(he chuckles)
Then again, I guess it's not much of a life worth saving, now is it?

DEAN
(to himself)
Wake up, Dean. Come on, wake up.

DREAM DEAN
I mean, after all, you've got nothing outside of Sam.

They stop circling each other. They're now back in their original positions. DEAN by the door, DREAM DEAN by the desk.

DREAM DEAN (continues)
You are nothing. You're as mindless and obedient as an attack dog.

DEAN
(smiling in denial, braving it out)
That -That's not true.

DREAM DEAN
No? What are the things that you want? What are the things that you dream? I mean, your car? That's Dad's. Your favorite leather jacket? Dad's. Your music? Dad's. Do you even have an original thought?

DEAN scoffs, not wanting to admit to anything.

DREAM DEAN
No. No, all there is is, "Watch out for Sammy. Look out for your little brother, boy!" You can still hear your Dad's voice in your head, can't you?

He motions with the weapon to his head.

DREAM DEAN
Clear as a bell.

DEAN
(smiling)
Just shut up.

DREAM DEAN lowers the gun.

DREAM DEAN
I mean, think about it ...

He begins to walk towards DEAN, whose smile is fading now.

DREAM DEAN
... all he ever did is train you, boss you around.

They're now standing face to face.

DREAM DEAN
But Sam .... Sam he doted on. Sam, he loved.

DEAN
I mean it. I'm getting angry.

DREAM DEAN
Dad knew who you really were. A good soldier and nothing else. Daddy's blunt little instrument.
(angry)
Your own father didn't care whether you lived or died. Why should you?

DEAN
(angry)
Son of a bitch!

DEAN pushes DREAM DEAN hard, knocking him into the wall above the desk.

DEAN
(screaming angrily)
My father was an obsessed bastard!

DREAM DEAN tries to get up and DEAN kicks him down on the desk again. DEAN holds the weapon as a bat and hits DREAM DEAN once and then pins him to the wall with it.

DEAN
All that crap he dumped on me, about protecting Sam! That was his crap. He's the one who couldn't protect his family. He-

DEAN steps back and swings the weapon again, hitting DREAM DEAN twice.

DEAN
He's the one who let Mom die.

DEAN pins DREAM DEAN again.

DEAN
– who wasn't there for Sam. I always was! He wasn't fair! I didn't deserve what he put on me.

He backs away from DREAM DEAN.

DEAN
And I don't deserve to go to Hell!

DEAN shoots DREAM DEAN twice in the chest. As he lowers the weapon and looking at DREAM DEAN, we see the latter is dead. Blood is splattered on DREAM DEAN's face and his eyes are closed.



EXT. IMPALA; DREAM

JEREMY is hitting SAM repeatedly on his legs and knees, both with the bat and with his feet. SAM is grunting through the assault, not able to move.


INT. MOTEL ROOM; DREAM

DEAN approaches DREAM DEAN on the desk, looking at him. Suddenly DREAM DEAN's eyes flickers open and they're completely black, as when a demon possesses a human. DEAN widens his eyes at that. DEMON DEAN sits up, looking into DEAN's eyes.

DEMON DEAN
(hard and angrily)
You can't escape me, Dean. You're gonna die. And this? This is what you're gonna become!


EXT. IMPALA; DREAM

JEREMY is now standing over SAM, the bat hovering above SAM's chest.

JEREMY
You can't stop me. There's nothing I can't do in here.

SAM
(panting)
Because of the Dream Root.

JEREMY
That's right.

SAM
Yeah? Well, you're forgetting something.

JEREMY now holds the bat, ready to swing down on SAM.

JEREMY
What's that?

SAM looks up at him.

SAM
I took the Dream Root too.

He smiles.

MAN
Jeremy!

As JEREMY turns around, the camera swings to the woods and we see JEREMY's father, HENRY, standing at the edge of the woods.

HENRY
Jeremy!

JEREMY
No. No ....

HENRY begins walking towards him.

JEREMY
Dad?

HENRY
You answer me when I'm talking to you, boy.

JEREMY backs away from SAM and HENRY. He no longer has the bat in his hands.

JEREMY
No ....

Suddenly SAM shows up and hits JEREMY across his face with the bat.



INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION

JEREMY's eyes flicks open.



INT. MOTEL ROOM; DREAM

DREAM DEAN stands up.



EXT. IMPALA; DREAM

SAM hits JEREMY again.



INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION

JEREMY turns over on the cot he's sleeping on, a clear reaction to the hit from SAM. He begins to shake and gasp in his bed, most likely from being beaten by SAM in his dream, and then he dies.


INT. MOTEL ROOM; DREAM

DEMON DEAN disappears and a flash on the screen appears. (this is matter of seconds)


INT. IMPALA
The boys wake up, panting. They look over at each other and then look away. DEAN is clearly shaken by what just happened.

ACT FIVE
INT. HALLWAY - DAY

BOBBY and SAM comes around the corner and walks down the hallway together. SAM has a key to the room in his hands.

BOBBY
So you did a little dream-weaving of your own in here, huh?

SAM
Yeah. I just sort of concentrated and it happened, you know?

BOBBY
Didn't have anything to do with... you know, your psychic stuff?

SAM looks at him, and they stop walking. BOBBY turns and looks at him.

SAM
No. I mean, I don't think so.

BOBBY
(nods)
Good. Good.

SAM swallows, looking a little worried. They continue walking down the hallway.



INT. MOTEL ROOM

DEAN is on the phone with his back to the door, hanging up the phone. Hearing the door opening, he turns around, and SAM and BOBBY enter.

DEAN
Hey, you guys seen Bela? She's not in her room. She's not answering her phone.

They close the door and comes in.

SAM
She must've taken off or something. <

DEAN
Just like that? It's a little weird.

BOBBY
Yeah well, if you ask me what's weird is why she helped us in the first place.

DEAN
I thought you saved her life.

BOBBY
(confused)
What the hell are you talking about?

DEAN
The thing in Flagstaff.

SAM turns around and looks at BOBBY.

BOBBY
That thing in Flagstaff was an amulet. I gave her a good deal, that's all.

DEAN gets confused at that, closing his mouth. SAM turns around and looks at him, confused. He turns back to BOBBY.

SAM
Well, the why did y-?

BOBBY
You boys better check your pockets.

SAM reaches into his pockets, as does DEAN.

BOBBY
Not literally.

DEAN stops what he's doing and slowly looks up at SAM and then turn to the safe in the closet. SAM who's looking at DEAN, does the same.

DEAN
(walking)
No, no, no, no.

He goes over to the safe and opens it up. It's empty.

SAM
The Colt.

DEAN looks over at him and slams the safe shut.

SAM
Bela stole the Colt.

BOBBY
Damn it, boys!

DEAN
Pack you crap.

DEAN walks over to his bag on the couch.

SAM
Why? Where are we going?

DEAN turns to him.

DEAN
We're gonna go hunt the bitch down.



EXT. MOTEL - DAY
The boys are standing by the open trunk, DEAN is zipping his bag closed and SAM puts his own in there.

DEAN
Hey, Sam. I was wondering. When you were in my head, what did you see?

SAM
Uh, just Jeremy. He kept me separated from you. Easier to beat my brains out that way, I guess.
(DEAN scoffs)
What about you? You never said.

DEAN shakes his head.

DEAN
Nothing. I was looking for you the whole time.

DEAN takes the keys out the lock to the trunk and closes it. They get into the car.

INT. IMPALA

SAM sighs as he sits down. DEAN looks thoughtful for a moment.

DEAN
Sam.

SAM looks over at him.

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN doesn't look at him.

DEAN
(clears his throat)
I've been doing some thinking, and... Well, the thing is... I don't wanna die.

SAM's expression softens, saddens.

DEAN
I don't wanna go to hell.

SAM swallows, not answering right away. He nods his head softly.

SAM
(softly)
All right. Yeah. We'll find a way to save you.

DEAN looks over at him, and then looks away nodding. He looks back at SAM, a little smile on his lips.

DEAN (a little shakey)
Okay, good.

SAM nods at him, reassuringly. Suddenly the scene goes into slow motion and DEAN looks to the side.

DREAM DEAN (V.O)
You can't escape me, Dean.

INT. MOTEL ROOM; DREAM - BLACK AND WHITE

DREAM DEAN (V.O)
You're gonna die.

We see the scene of DREAM DEAN waking up again as a demon after being shot.

DEMON DEAN
And this? This is what you're gonna become!

We see DEAN, when he first snapped his fingers. His eyes are now black as night, he's a demon. He smiles and snaps his fingers and the screen goes black.
