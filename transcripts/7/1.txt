NOW
INT. CROWLEY'S LAB - NIGHT

The scene is exactly as we left it at the end of 6.22 The Man Who Knew Too Much. CASTIEL stares at DEAN and BOBBY, waiting, as SAM staggers while standing behind him. After a beat, BOBBY gets on his knees.

BOBBY:
Well, all right then. Is this good, or you want the whole "forehead to the carpet" thing?

BOBBY (to DEAN):
Guys?

DEAN and SAM start to kneel.

CASTIEL:
Stop. What's the point if you don't mean it? You fear me. Not love, not respect, just fear.

SAM:
Cas...

CASTIEL:
Sam, you have nothing to say to me; you stabbed me in the back. (to BOBBY and DEAN): Get up.

DEAN:
Cas, come on, this isn't you.

CASTIEL:
The Castiel you knew is gone.

DEAN:
So what, then? Kill us?

CASTIEL:
What a brave little ant you are. You know you're powerless, you wouldn't dare move against me again. That would be pointless. So I have no need to kill you. Not now. Besides...once you were my favorite pets before you turned and bit me.

DEAN:
Who are you?

CASTIEL:
I'm God. And if you stay in your place, you may live in my kingdom. If you rise up, I will strike you down. Not doing so well, are you Sam?

SAM:
I'm fine...(clears throat)...I'm...fine.

DEAN:
You said you would fix him - you promised!

CASTIEL:
IF you stood down, which you hardly did. Be thankful for my mercy. I could have cast you back into the pit.

DEAN:
Cas, come on, this is nuts! You can turn this around, please!

CASTIEL:
I hope for your sake this is the last you see me.

CASTIEL disappears. BOBBY, DEAN, and SAM look around and at each other for a few seconds, until SAM's nose starts to bleed.

DEAN:
Sam, you okay?

SAM sees a vision of himself burning in hell; he then falls to the ground and cuts his hand on some broken glass. He keeps seeing glimpses of his body on fire.

EXT. WOODED MEADOW IN HEAVEN - DAY

CASTIEL:
Understand. If you followed Raphael, if you stood against me, punishment is certain; there is nowhere to hide. The rest of you, our Father left a long time ago, and that was hard. I thought the answer was free will. But I understand now. You need a firm hand. You need a father. And I am your father now. Be obedient, children. Or this will be your fate.

Camera pans down to a dead ANGEL; then pulls back to reveal CASTIEL standing in a meadow in heaven surrounded by dozens of dead ANGELS, evident by all of the scorched black wing marks.

CASTIEL:
It is a new day. On earth, and in heaven. Rejoice.

SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)

ACT ONE
EXT. BOBBY'S YARD - DAY

DEAN is seemingly crouched inside the crushed and upside-down IMPALA, with his boots pressed against the roof.

DEAN:
(Grunts) Come on. (grunts) (the sound of groaning metal is heard as he tries to push the dented roof out with his feet). Come on, baby!

The camera flips around to reveal the car is right-side up and DEAN is on his back.

BOBBY:
So, you fixin' her or primal screamin'?

DEAN extricates himself from the IMPALA and accepts a beer from BOBBY.

DEAN:
Ah, thanks. How's Sam?

BOBBY:
He's still under. But alive.

DEAN:
Yeah? What about God part deux?

BOBBY:
I got all kinds of feelers out, so far diddly.

DEAN:
And what exactly are you looking for?

BOBBY:
Exactly. What? Miracles, mass visions, trenchcoat on a tortilla? I don't know what I'm lookin' for.

DEAN:
Ah, well, he'll surface.

BOBBY:
So say we do suss out where "new and improved" flew off to..."

DEAN:
Yeah?

BOBBY:
The hell we plan to do about it?

DEAN:
I don't know, Bobby, I got no more clue than you do.

BOBBY:
I don't even know what books to hit for this, Dean.

DEAN:
Well, figure it out! I'm sorry. This ain't in no book. If you stick your neck out, Cas steps on it. So you know what I'm gonna do?

BOBBY:
What?

DEAN:
Imma fix this car. Because that's what I can do. I can work on her 'til she's mint. And when Sam wakes up, no matter what shape he's in, we'll glue him back together too. We owe him that.

BOBBY:
I'm with you.

DEAN lies back down in the IMPALA and begins to pound on the roof with a mallet.

INT. BOBBY'S KITCHEN - DAY

DEAN enters from the back door area, wiping his hands. He gets a beer from the fridge. SAM appears in the doorway from the living room.

SAM:
Hey Dean.

DEAN:
Ah, you're walking and talking.

SAM:
Yeah. I, uh, put on my own socks, the whole nine.

DEAN:
Well, that's uh... I mean you, uh, you sure you're okay?

SAM:
Yeah. My head hurts a little, but...basically.

DEAN:
Seriously?

SAM:
Look man, I'm as surprised as you are but, yeah, I swear.

DEAN:
Good! No reason putting a gift horse under a microscope, right?

SAM:
Yeah. So what happened with Cas?

DEAN:
Why don't you come help me with the car, I'll fill you in?

SAM:
Okay.

DEAN: leaves through the back door. SAM starts to follow him but hesitates as he hears the faint sound of chains jingling. He nervously looks around but seems to see nothing out of order.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

The sign identifies the church as "Lady of Serenity Church," and says "BELIEVE IN GOD HE WALKS AMONG US"

INT. CHURCH - DAY

A REVEREND is preaching about homosexuality being wrong.

REVEREND:
Plenty speak for them and their so-called lifestyle. Media, Hollywood, Lady Gaga won't shut up for love or money.

CONGREGATION chuckles.

REVEREND:
Yeah, funny, but that's why we raise our voices! And picket their so-called weddings, and their funerals. Someone has to speak for God.

CASTIEL (O.S.):
And who says you speak for God?

The CONGREGATION all turn and look at CASTIEL, who stands at the other end of the aisle.

CASTIEL:
You're wrong, I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation. On the other hand, I cannot abide hypocrites like you, Reverend.

REVEREND:
Okay, fun's over friend.

CASTIEL:
Tell your flock where your genitals have been before you speak for me.

REVEREND:
And who the heck are you?

CASTIEL:
I'm God.

The CONGREGATION murmurs. A parishioner stands and tries to speak, but after a look from CASTIEL he falls back unconscious, breaking the church pew.

CASTIEL:
And he who lies in my name shall choke on his own false tongue, and his poisonous words shall betray him.

The REVEREND begins to choke and foam at the mouth; he falls to his knees and then collapses to the floor, dead.

CASTIEL (addressing the CONGREGATION):
For I am the Lord, your God.

CASTIEL starts to walk out of the church but stops when he hears a whispering voice in his head.

VOICE:
Castiel...

CASTIEL grasps the back of a pew.

VOICE:
Cas!

CASTIEL turns and looks at an image of JESUS in a stained-glass window. He collects himself and resumes walking out the church, but leaves a singed patch of wood on the back of the pew where his hand was; also revealing that the image of JESUS in the window has changed to that of CASTIEL in his trenchcoat.

INT. BOBBY'S BASEMENT - DAY

SAM is looking through tool drawers. He suddenly hears the faint jingling of chains as well as ominous laughter. He sees nothing and goes back to his task, finding the wrench he was looking for. He turns around and is shocked to find the basement bathed in an eerie red light. Many chains hang from the ceiling, as well as meathooks with bits of flesh and hair still attached.

EVIL VOICE:
Ha ha ha ha ha!

SAM:
No, no, this can't be happening.

LUCIFER'S VOICE: Sam!
BOBBY (O.S.):
Hey Sam! What are you, taking a nap down here?

BOBBY comes down the stairs, and the basement is now back to normal. A terrified SAM wields the wrench like a weapon, pointing it at BOBBY.

BOBBY:
It's Cas, we think. Come on.

SAM:
Yeah. Coming.

INT. BOBBY'S KITCHEN - DAY

TELEVISION SCREEN: Breaking News - CBA News

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
The sudden deaths of some 200 religious leaders are currently under investigation. The Vatican has yet to issue a statement, but some are already calling this an act of God.

DEAN, BOBBY, and SAM stand watching the TV news. Now, a woman is being interviewed outside the church.

WOMAN ON TV:
We all saw him. No beard, no robe. He was young...and...and sexy. He had a raincoat.

DEAN shuts off the TV.

EXT. BOBBY'S YARD - DAY

DEAN is in the IMPALA, working on a window, while listening to a radio announcer.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Believed to be target hits high up in white-supremacy organizations. The FBI now believes the Ku Klux Klan has been forced to disband.

DEAN: Can't argue with that one.

EXT. BOBBY'S YARD - NIGHT

DEAN is working under the IMPALA's hood.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
A freak lightning strike on the heels of the fire that burned down the Center for Vibrational Enlightenment earlier today. Said a spokesman, "this tragedy represents the largest loss in New Age motivational speaker history".

SAM:
Motivational speakers?

DEAN:
Yeah, I'm not sure new Cas gets irony any better than old Cas. Of course, old Cas wouldn't smite Madison Square Garden just to prove a point. He is off the deep end of the deep end. And there's no slowing down.

SAM:
So, what? Try to talk to him again?

DEAN:
Sam.

SAM:
Dean, all we can do is talk to the guy.

DEAN:
He's not a guy. He's God. And he's pissed. And when God gets righteous, you get the hell out of the way; haven't you read the Bible?

SAM:
I guess...

DEAN:
Cas is never coming back. He's lied to us, he used us, he cracked your gourd like it was nothing. No more talk; we have spent enough on him.

SAM:
Okay.

DEAN:
Hand me that socket wrench.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Close-up of the front of a trailer and it's Tennessee license plate.

Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Were Made For Walking" plays. Wide shot of the outside of the trailer, and we see there are ENOCHIAN SIGILS on the windows.

INT. TRAILER - DAY

CROWLEY pours a glass of whiskey and sits down in front of a TV.

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
...since biblical times. Leprosy was once so prevalent that colonies were found around the world. Today we are witnessing the unprecedented shutdown of India's leper colonies after what many are calling a miracle healing. Here with us, health correspondent Rob Lewinsky.

CROWLEY:
Educate me, Lewinsky.

The TV suddenly goes dark.

CASTIEL (O.S.):
Hello, Crowley.

CASTIEL has silently appeared in CROWLEY's trailer.

CASTIEL:
You look stressed.

CROWLEY sighs

CROWLEY:
Bollocks.

ACT TWO
INT TRAILER - DAY

CROWLEY:
So, the jig is up. You found me.

CASTIEL:
I never lost you.

CASTIEL looks at the Enochian sigils scrawled all over the walls.

CASTIEL:
These scratches, they're all useless.

CROWLEY:
Still.. Can't blame a girl for trying.

CROWLEY:
Fancy a drink before you smite me?

CASTIEL:
No.

CROWLEY:
You like to bend them right over, do you? Let's go.

CROWLEY outstretches both arms and cringes.

CASTIEL:
I'm not going to kill you, Crowley. I have plans for you.

CROWLEY:
What's it?

CASTIEL:
Here's our new arrangement; I let you live, you return to your post as king of hell.

CROWLEY:
but?

CASTIEL:
I choose where each soul goes. I control the flow, and you take whatever I give you.

CROWLEY turns his back on CASTIEL and moves in front of the sink.

CROWLEY:
I take it you intend to keep the live share? So, what you're saying is hell's being downsized?

CASTIEL:
I would have done away with it completely, but I need a threat to hold over my enemies, and we need to keep Michael and Lucifer's cage.

CROWLEY:
Right. I gather this is not a, uh, negotiation.

CASTIEL:
No.

CROWLEY:
Then I graciously accept, boss.

CROWLEY tips his glass to CASTIEL and turns to pour another glass.

CASTIEL looks down to discover sores boiling on the top of his hands.

CASTIEL:
I'll be in touch.

CROWLEY turns to look at CASTIEL to see he has already vanished.

INT: BOBBY'S KITCHEN- NIGHT

SAM is reading a book. He is startled by a strange noise and looks behind himself.

The ceiling panel begins to crack and a long chain falls down through the hole and wraps itself around SAM'S neck and drags SAM to the ceiling. A laughing voice can be heard in the background.

Suddenly SAM wakes up to realize that he was hallucinating.

SAM:
Dean... Bobby?

IN: BOBBY'S GARAGE- NIGHT

DEAN has the windows covered, getting ready to paint the IMPALA.

BOBBY:
She's looking good.. Considering.

BOBBY hands DEAN a beer.

DEAN:
Considering? I should do this professionally.

DEAN and BOBBY turn and open their BEERS.

BOBBY:
So.. Seen Sam lately?

DEAN:
Yeah, why?

BOBBY hesitates to answer and DEAN looks at him worryingly.

DEAN:
What? Well, spit it out.

BOBBY:
How is that kid even vertical? I mean, Cas broke his damn pinata.

DEAN:
I know.

DEAN turns back to the IMPALA.

BOBBY:
I mean, I get how he came to help us back at the lab. Adrenaline. Sure, but now?

DEAN begins to tape the IMPALA'S antenna.

DEAN:
Well.. he says he's okay.

BOBBY:
How?

DEAN:
I don't know. I just pray to God it's true.

BOBBY:
We need to come up with a new saying for that.

SAM begins to enter the GARAGE, but he overhears DEAN and BOBBY'S conversation.

DEAN:
Seriously though, Bobby. Look at our lives. How many more hits can we take? So, if Sam says he's good.. GOOD.

BOBBY:
You believe that?

DEAN:
Yeah.

DEAN hesitates for a moment.

DEAN:
No. You wanna know why? because we never catch a break. So why would we this time? I just.. just this one thing. You know? but I'm not dumb. I'm not going to get my hopes up just to get kicked in the daddy-pills again.

SAM emerges from eavesdropping and startles DEAN and BOBBY.

SAM:
Hey.

BOBBY:
Hey. How are you feeling, sport?

SAM:
Can't complain!

DEAN:
Great. What's the word?

SAM:
Well, a publishing house literally exploded about an hour ago. The guy has a body count that's really getting up there. We gotta do something.

BOBBY:
What we've got to do is hunt the son of bitch. Unfortunately, I lost my God guns.

SAM:
Well, I mean is there some kind of heavenly weapon? Maybe something out of that angel arsenal that Balthazar stole? There has to be something that can hurt him.

DEAN:
He's God, Sam. There's nothing, but there might be someone.

INT: BOBBY'S BASEMENT- NIGHT.

BOBBY lights a match and throws it into a bowl where it ERUPTS into a huge flame. There's a DEVIL'S trap scrawled on the floor.

CROWLEY appears inside the DEVIL's trap, with a glass of whiskey in his hand.

CROWLEY:
No. No! NO! Come on!

BOBBY:
Don't act so surprised.

CROWLEY:
My new boss is going to kill me for even talking to you lads.

DEAN:
Well, you're lucky we're not stabbing you in your scuzzy face, you little piece..

SAM:
Whoa, wait! What new boss?

CROWLEY:
Castiel, you giraffe.

BOBBY:
Is your boss?

CROWLEY:
Is everybody's boss. What do you think he's going to do if he finds out we've been conspiring? You do you want to conspire, don't you?

BOBBY:
No. We want you to just stand there and look pretty.

CROWLEY:
Listening.

DEAN:
We need a spell to bind Death.

CROWLEY:
Bind? Enslave Death? You having a laugh?

DEAN:
Lucifer did it.

CROWLEY:
That's Lucifer.

SAM:
A spell's a spell.

CROWLEY:
You really believe you can handle that kind of horsepower? You're delusional!

DEAN:
Death is the only player on the board left that has the kind of juice to take Cas.

CROWLEY:
They'll both mash us like peas. Why should I help with a suicide mission?

BOBBY:
Look! Do you really want Cas running the universe?

CROWLEY looks down and pours himself another drink.

INT: SIDEWALK- DAY

A blind HOMELESS MAN is sitting on the sidewalk with a tin can, asking for change.

HOMELESS MAN:
Some help, please. Please. Help. So helpless.

CASTIEL comes by and drops some coins in his can.

HOMELESS MAN:
God bless you, Sir.

CASTIEL:
You're a true believer. People say I'm wrathful, but I only punish liars and those who forsake me. I am a just God.

HOMELESS MAN:
Excuse me?

CASTIEL touches his hand to the HOMELESS MAN'S head. He closes his eyes-

CASTIEL:
See.

The HOMELESS MAN opens his eyes, and his vision is restored.

HOMELESS MAN:
Oh my God, I can see!

He looks up to see CASTIEL standing over him.

HOMELESS MAN:
Your face.. What's wrong with you?

EX: BATHROOM- DAY

CASTIEL is looking at himself in front of a mirror. His face is breaking out in blisters.

CREEPY VOICE:
A mistake. Too late. Let us out.

CASTIEL unbuttons his shirt and the MONSTER souls, in the form of two hands under his skin, are trying to bust their way out of his VESSEL.

CREEPY VOICE:
Let us out. Let us out!

CASTIEL:
No.

ACT THREE
INT: BOBBY'S HOUSE- DAY

BOBBY is walking down the stairs while flipping through his mail. He looks down in time to see a piece of paper pass under the front door.

BOBBY picks the paper up, and walks OUTSIDE to see who left it.

BOBBY:
Hello?

BOBBY looks at the paper to see that it's the SPELL they had asked for.

BOBBY:
It's from Crowley.

DEAN:
Well, Who feels like hog tying death tonight?

BOBBY:
Old age is over-rated anyhow.

EX: BOBBY'S LIVING ROOM- DAY

BOBBY:
Well, we've got most of this stuff, but we're going to have to make a run for a few things.

DEAN:
Like?

BOBBY:
Like an act of God crystallised forever.

SAM:
What's that supposed to mean?

BOBBY:
I think it means an actual crystal. See, lightning strikes sand at the right angle - it crystallises into the perfect shape of itself.

SAM:
Lightning. Act of God.

BOBBY:
Jinga. You got yourself a fulgurate and we're gonna need a biggie.

DEAN:
And let me guess... rare.

BOBBY:
I found records of an auction. Winning bidder lives about nine hours from here.

SECURITY GUARD:
Hey!

DEAN:
Excuse me. You got any Grey Poupon?

SAM:
Grey Poupon? Seriously?

DEAN:
It's what popped in my head.

DEAN:
Hi. Uh... I don't want to hurt you. Really.

DR. WEISS:
I'm the one with the firearm, son.

DEAN:
I get that.

DEAN:
Okay. Yeah. Good. Hey, guys. Uh, so this is Dr. and Mrs. Weiss.

SAM:
Hi. Sorry.

DEAN:
I found the God thingy.

BOBBY:
Well, let's light this candle.

DEAN:
You're welcome.

BOBBY:
Te nunc invoco, mortem. Te in mea potestate defixi. Nunc et in aeternum!

DEAN:
Um... Hello? Death?

DEATH:
You're joking.

DEAN:
I'm sorry, Death. This isn't what it seems.

DEATH:
Seems like you bound me.

DEAN:
For good reason, okay? Just, uh, hear us out. Um... Fried pickle chip? They're the best in the state.

DEATH:
That easy to soothe me, you think? This is about Sam's hallucinations, I assume?

DEAN:
What?

DEATH:
Sorry, Sam. One wall per customer. Now unbind me.

SAM:
We can't. Y-yet.

DEATH:
This isn't going to end well.

DEAN:
We need you to kill God.

DEATH:
Pardon?

BOBBY:
Kill God. You heard right. Your... Honor.

DEATH:
What makes you think I can do that?

DEAN:
You told me.

DEATH:
Why should I?

DEAN:
Because... We said so, and we're the boss of you. I mean... Respectfully.

CASTIEL:
Amazing.

SAM:
Cas.

CASTIEL:
I didn't want to kill you, but now...

DEAN:
You can't kill us.

CASTIEL:
You've erased any nostalgia I had for you, Dean.

DEAN:
Death is our bitch. We ain't gonna die, even if God pulls the trigger.

DEATH:
Annoying little protozoa, aren't they? "God"? You look awfully like a mutated angel to me. Your vessel's melting. You're going to explode.

CASTIEL:
No, I'm not. When I've finished my work, I'll repair myself.

DEATH:
You think you can because you think you're simply under the weight of all those souls, yes? But that's not the worst problem. There are things much older than souls in Purgatory, and you gulped those in, too.

CASTIEL:
Irrelevant. I control them.

DEATH:
For the moment.

DEAN:
Wait -- uh, what older things?

DEATH:
Long before God created Angel and man, he made the first beasts -- the Leviathans.

DEAN:
Leviathans?

DEATH:
I personally found them entertaining, but he was concerned they'd chomp the entire petri dish, so he locked them away. Why do you think he created Purgatory? To keep those clever, poisonous things out. Now Castiel has swallowed them. He's the one thin membrane between the old ones and your home.

CASTIEL:
Enough.

DEATH:
Stupid little soldier you are.

CASTIEL:
Why? Because I dared open a door that he shut? Where is he? I did a service, taking his place.

DEATH:
Service? Settling petty vendettas?

CASTIEL:
No. I'm cleaning up one mess after another -- selflessly.

DEATH:
Quite the humanitarian.

CASTIEL:
And how would you know? What are you, really? A flyswatter?

DEATH:
Destined to swat you, I think.

CASTIEL:
Unless I take you first.

DEATH:
Really bought his own press, this one. Please, Cas. I know God, and you, sir, are no God.

DEAN:
All right, put your junk away, both of you. Look, call him what you want. Just kill him now!

DEATH:
All right. Fine.

(Castiel snaps his fingers and releases Death.)

Thank you. Shall we kickbox now?

(Castiel stares.)

I had a tingle I'd be reaping someone very, very soon.

(Dean starts to back away.)

Don't worry -- not you.

(Death starts to eat the pickle chips. Castiel vanishes.)

Well, he was in a hurry.

SENATOR MICHELLE WALKER:
Yes, that's exactly why I'm running again -- to save my constituents from the godless policies of my opponents. Couldn't have said it better myself.

SENATOR'S AIDE:
Sir? Can I help you?

CASTIEL:
I'm here to see the Senator.

SENATOR'S AIDE:
Um, regarding?

CASTIEL:
Abuse of power.

SENATOR'S AIDE:
Excuse me?

CASTIEL:
I am not petty. I'm punishing a woman who causes poverty and despair in my name. I put your needs first. Don't you understand?

The AIDE doesn't reply, staring at him confusedly. CASTIEL turns to the other staff members at the desk.

CASTIEL:
All of you. I am a better God than my father. How can I make you understand?

CASTIEL hears menacing voices call his name, and he starts laughing manically.

DEATH:
Ahh.

DEAN:
Um...

DEATH:
Shut up, Dean. I'm not here to tie your shoes every time you trip. I warned you about those souls how long ago? Long enough to stop that fool. And here we are again, with your little planet on the edge of immolation.

DEAN:
Well, I'm sorry. All right? I've been trying to save this planet, so maybe you should find somebody better to tip off.

DEATH:
Maybe I should spend my effort on a better planet. Well, it's been amusing.

SAM:
Wait, h-hold on, hold on. Just -- can you give us something? You -- you have to care a little bit about what happens to us.

DEATH:
You know, I really don't. But I do find that little angel arrogant.

DEAN:
Great. Let's go with that.

DEATH:
Your only hope is to have him return it all to Purgatory. Quickly.

SAM:
We need a door.

DEATH:
You have everything you need at that lab. Get him to return there and compel him to give up the power.

DEAN:
Compel?

DEATH:
Figure it out.

BOBBY:
But that door only opens in the eclipse, and that's over.

DEATH:
I'll make another. 3:59 Sunday morning, just before dawn. Be punctual. Don't thank me. Clean up your mess. Try to bind me again, you'll die before you start. Nice pickle chips, by the way.

CASTIEL:
No. No. No.

SAM:
You want some coffee with that?

DEAN:
It's 6:00 p.m. somewhere.

SAM:
We got to hit the road. I mean, how are we supposed to get Cas to that lab by friggin' 3:59 a.m.?

DEAN:
We don't.

SAM:
What do you mean, "We don't"?

DEAN:
I mean, we can't bring the horse to water, and we can't make it drink. Why fool ourselves?

SAM:
Dean, look, I know you think that Cas is gone --

DEAN:
It's 'cause he is.

SAM:
He's not! He's in there somewhere, Dean. I know it.

DEAN:
No, you don't.

SAM:
No, I don't. But, look, I was pretty far gone sometimes myself, and never gave up on me.

DEAN:
Yeah, and it turns out that you're about the same open book as you've always been. Hallucinations? Really? I got to find out from Death?

SAM:
What was I supposed to do?

DEAN:
How about not lie? How about tell me that you've got crazy crap climbing those walls?

SAM:
Why? You can't help. You got a lot of pretty severe crap swinging your way lately, and -- and I thought --what? I thought why burst the one good bubble you had left? It's under control.

DEAN:
What? What, exactly, is under control?

SAM:
I know what's real and what's not.

DEAN:
Sam --

SAM:
Dean, look, we can debate this once we deal with Cas.

DEAN:
Yeah, you know how I'm gonna deal? I'm gonna stuff my piehole, I'm gonna drink, and I'm gonna watch some Asian cartoon porn and act like the world's about to explode because it is. Hey. You got to be kidding me. "Massacre at the campaign office of an incumbent Senator by a trench-coated man." There's security footage. Well, I think reaching Cas is, uh... out of the cards.

SAM:
Hey, Castiel. Um... Maybe this is pointless. Look... I don't know if any part of you even cares, but, um, I still think you're one of us, deep down. I mean, way, way, way off the reservation, but... Look, we still have till dawn to stop this. Let us help. Please.

SAM:
Only if you turn that off.

CASTIEL:
Sam?

SAM:
Cas.

CASTIEL:
I heard your call. I need help.

ACT FOUR
CASTIEL:
We need the right blood. There's a small jar -- end of the hall, s-supply closet.

SAM:
Got it.

CASTIEL:
Dean?

DEAN:
What, you need something else?

CASTIEL:
No. I feel regret, about you and what I did to Sam.

DEAN:
Yeah, well, you should.

CASTIEL:
If there was time, if I was strong enough, I'd -- I'd fix him now. I just wanted to make amends before I die.

DEAN:
Okay.

CASTIEL:
Is it working?

DEAN:
Does it make you feel better?

CASTIEL:
No. You?

DEAN:
Not a bit.

LUCIFER:
I know. It all seems so silly, doesn't it? Hi, Sam. Long time, no spooning.

SAM:
You're not here. You're in Hell.

LUCIFER:
Now, that you're right on.

SAM:
Meat hooks... Chains... You. It's not real. It's just my brain leaking memories from the cage 'cause of the wall breaking down. That's all.

LUCIFER:
Hmm. That's very good, your little theory. It's wrong. Sam, this isn't you going guano. Everything else is.

SAM:
What?

LUCIFER:
Everything... From the second you sprung out of that lock box.

SAM:
That's impossible.

LUCIFER:
No. Escaping was impossible. I have to say, I think this is my best torture yet -- make you believe that you're free and then... Yank the wool off of your eyes. You never left, Sam. You're still in the cage... With me.

BOBBY:
Hang in there. Just a couple of minutes. Where's Sam? It's go time.

DEAN:
Sam?! Damn it.

BOBBY:
That's good enough. Okay, step right up, Cas.

BOBBY:
Ianua magna purgatorii, clausa est ob nos lumine eius ab oculis nostris retento sed nunc stamus ad limen huius ianuae magnae et demisse fideliter perhonorifice paramus aperire eam.

CASTIEL:
I'm sorry, Dean.

BOBBY:
Creaturae terrificae quarum ungulae et dentes nunquam tetigerunt carnem eius ad mundum nostrum nunc ianua magna, aperta tandem!

DEAN:
Cas?

ACT FIVE
BOBBY:
He's cold.

DEAN:
Is he breathing?

BOBBY:
No.

DEAN:
Maybe angels don't need to breathe.

BOBBY:
He's gone, Dean.

DEAN:
Damn it. Cas, you child. Why didn't you listen to me? Cas?! Hey! Hey! Okay. All right.

CASTIEL:
That was unpleasant.

DEAN:
Let's get him up. Easy, there.

CASTIEL:
I'm alive.

BOBBY:
Looks like.

CASTIEL:
I'm astonished. Thank you -- both of you.

BOBBY:
We were mostly... just trying to save the world.

CASTIEL:
I'm ashamed. I really overreached.

DEAN:
You think?

CASTIEL:
I'm gonna find some way to redeem myself to you.

DEAN:
All right, well, one thing at a time. Come on. Let's get you out of here. Come on.

CASTIEL:
I mean it, Dean.

DEAN:
Okay. All right. But let's go find Sam, okay?

CASTIEL:
You need to run now! I-I can't hold them back!

DEAN:
Hold who back?

CASTIEL:
They held on inside me. Dean, they're so strong.

DEAN:
Who the hell --?

CASTIEL:
Leviathan! I can't fight them. Run!

DEAN:
Go! Go get Sam! Go get Sam!

LEVIATHAN:
Too late.

DEAN:
Cas?

LEVIATHAN:
Cas is -- he's gone. He's dead. We run the show now. Ah. Oh, this is going to be so much fun.
