TEASER
EXTERIOR. NIGHT. CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI

A car moves down the road, radio talking about the unseasonably cold weather. A black man sits behind the wheel. The radio crackles and dies.

A large black truck approaches behind his car, moving quickly. The man looks in his review mirror.

MAN
What the....?

The vehicles race along the road until the truck backends the sedan once, and then again.

The radio comes back to life, talking about politics. The truck is suddenly gone. The man continues driving, watching his review mirror. Suddenly bright headlights shine through his windscreen. The truck is waiting. The man skids to a halt, backs up and turns to go the other way. The truck is reving.

He is backended again and fights to control the car as it swerves on the icy road. He is backended once last time and loses control, leaving the road and crashing through a cemetary. The car flips, bounces, and skids to a halt. The truck cruises to a stop, revs a few times, then backs up and disappears into thin air.

ACT ONE
EXTERIOR. GAS STATION

SAM is looking at a map laid out on top of the car, DEAN has his phone to his ear.

SAM
Ok. I think I found a way we can bypass that construction just east of here. We might even make Pennsylvania faster than we thought.

DEAN
(Lowering his phone and looking thoughtful) Yeah. Problem is, we're not going to Pennsylvania.

SAM
We what?

DEAN
I just got a call from an, uh, old friend. Her father was killed last night, think it might be our kind of thing.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Yeah. Believe me, she never woulda called, never, if she didn't need us.

DEAN
(getting into the Impala.) Come on, are you coming or not?

...........................

Impala cruises down the road, fields on one side, a lake on the other.

SAM
By old friend you mean...?

DEAN
A friend that's not new.

SAM
Oh yeah, thanks. So her name's Cassie huh? You never mentioned her..

DEAN
Didn't I?

A long pause, SAM looks at DEAN expectantly.

DEAN
Yeah, we went out.

SAM
You mean you dated somebody? For more than one night.

DEAN
Am I speaking a language you're not getting here? Dad and I were working a job in Ohio, she was finishing up college. We went out for a coupla weeks.

SAM
And...?

DEAN shrugs slightly.

SAM
Look, it's terrible about her dad, but it kinda sounds like a standard car accident. I'm not seeing how it fits with what we do. Which by the way, how does she know what we do?

DEAN looks shifty.

SAM
You told her. You told her, the secret! Our big family rule number one. We do what we do and we shut up about it. For a year and a half I do nothing but lie to Jessica, and you go out with this chick in Ohio a coupla times and you tell her everything?

DEAN stays silent, staring straight ahead.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN
Yeah. Looks like.

He continues staring ahead and put's his foot down. SAM does the bitchface, shaking his head.

INTERIOR. NEWSPAPER OFFICE

MIDDLE AGED BLACK MAN
It's a newspaper we put out, not a bulletin for the Mayor's office.

MIDDLE AGED WHITE MAN
Get off your soapbox Jimmy, I'm urging a little discretion is all.

YOUNG WOMAN
No, I think you're telling us what you want us to print and what you want us to sit on.

MAYOR
I know you're upset Cassie, I liked your dad a lot. But I think your grief is clouding your judgment.

JIMMY
Two black people were killed on the same stretch of road in the same way in two week.

SAM and DEAN enter the office.

MAYOR
Jimmy, you're too close to this. Those guys were friends of yours. Again, Cassie, I'm very sorry for your loss.

The MAYOR leaves, JIMMY walks away. CASSIE sighs and turns around, looking straight at DEAN.

Looking slightly apprehensive, DEAN nods at her and grins.

CASSIE
(Staring) Dean.

DEAN
Hey Cassie.

They stare at each other for a long moment, not speaking. SAM watches, smiling to himself.

DEAN
(Clearing his throat) This my brother Sam.

Cassie smiles at SAM, who returns one of his own. Her gaze returns to DEAN.

DEAN
Sorry bout your dad.

CASSIE
Yeah. Me too.

DEAN and CASSIE keep staring at each other.

EXTERIOR SHOT OF LARGE COUNTRY HOUSE

........................

INTERIOR OF HOUSE. LOUNGE ROOM

CASSIE
(carrying in a tray of tea and cups) My mothers in pretty bad shape. I've been staying with her. I wish she wouldn't go off by herself. She's been so nervous and frightened. She was worried about dad

DEAN
Why?

CASSIE
(Pouring tea) He was scared. He was seeing things.

DEAN
Like what?

CASSIE
He swore he saw an awful-looking black truck following him.

SAM
A truck. Who was the driver?

CASSIE
(Handing them cups of tea) He didn't talk about a driver. Just the truck. He said it would appear and disappear. And, in the accident, Dad's car was dented, like it had been slammed into by something big.

SAM
(accepting his cup) Thanks. Now you're sure this dent wasn't there before?

DEAN looks at his cup of tea like it's an alien, and quickly deposits it on a side table.

CASSIE
He sold cars. Always drove a new one. There wasn't a scratch on that thing. It had rained hard that night. There was mud everywhere. There was a distinct set of muddy tracks leading from dad's car...leading right to the edge, where he went over.

CASSIE bows her head, getting her emotions under control.

CASSIE
One set of tracks. His.

DEAN
The first was a friend of your fathers?

CASSIE
Best friend. Clayton Soames.They owned the car dealership together. Same thing. Dent. No Tracks. And the cops said exactly what they said about dad. He 'lost control of his car.'

DEAN
Can you think of any reason why your father and his partner might be targets?

CASSIE
No.

SAM
And you think this vanishing truck ran them off the road?

CASSIE
When you say it aloud like that...listen, I'm a little sceptical about this...ghost stuff...or whatever it is you guys are into.

DEAN
(huffing) Skeptical. If I remember, I think you said I was nuts.

CASSIE
That was then.

They stare at each other again.

CASSIE
I just know that I can't explain what happened up there. So I called you.

Sound of a door opening, a middle aged woman enters.

SAM and DEAN rise to their feet, CASSIE goes to take her mom's arm.

CASSIE
Mom. Where have you been I was so...

MRS ROBINSON
I had no idea you'd invited friends over.

CASSIE
Mom, this is Dean, a...friend of mine from.... college. And his brother Sam.

MRS ROBINSON
Well I won't interrupt you.

DEAN
Mrs Robinson. We're sorry for your loss. We'd like to talk to you for a minute if you don't mind?

MRS ROBINSON
(Slightly affronted) I'm really not up for that right now.

She leaves the room, those remaining look at each other.

................................

EXTERIOR. NIGHT.

The camera pans across an open field to a crashed car, wheels spinning. JIMMY is slumped over the wheel, unmoving. On the road the black truck revs it's engine then backs up, disappearing.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXTERIOR. DAY. THE SAME FIELD

The MAYOR and CASSIE walk among the emergency vehicles.

MAYOR
(To Cassie) Jimmy meant somethng to this town. He was one of our best. We won't be the same without him.

CASSIE
Our best seem to be dropping like flies. Clayton, my father, Jimmy.

MAYOR
What is it exactly you want me to do?

CASSIE
How bout closing this section of road for starters?

MAYOR
Close the main road. The only road in and out of town? Accidents do happen Cassie, and that's what they are. Accidents.

DEAN and SAM approach and stand behind CASSIE.

DEAN
Did the cops check for additional dinting on Jimmy's car, see if it was pushed?

MAYOR
(To Cassie) Who's this?

CASSIE
Dean and Sam Winchester. Family friends. This is Mayor Harold Todd.

MAYOR
There's one set of tire tracks. One. . doesn't point to foul play.

CASSIE
Mayor, the police and town officials take their cues from you. If you're indifferent about...

MAYOR
Indifferent!

CASSIE
Would you close the road if the victims were white?

MAYOR
You suggesting I'm racist Cassie? I'm the last person you should talk to like that.

Cassie
And why is that.

MAYOR
Why don't you ask your mother.

The MAYOR walks away, leaving them standing in the field.

....................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

SAM
(In trousers, shirt and tie, picking up a suit jacket) I'll say this for her, she's fearless.

DEAN
(In a suit, fixing tie in the mirror)Mm-hmm.

SAM
(grinning) Bet she kicked your ass a coupla times.

DEAN glances at him then returns to the mirror.

SAM
What's interesting is you guys never really look at each other at the same time. You look at her when she's not looking, she checks you out when you look away. (Grinning) It's just a...just an interesting observation in a....you know...observationally interesting way.

DEAN
You think we might have more pressing issues here?

SAM
Hey, if I'm hitting a nerve.

DEAN
(turning away) Let's go.

Sam snickers.

......................

Impala cruising down a wet country road.

.......................

EXTERIOR. DAY. DOCKS.

DEAN and SAM walking down a pier. A few people are fishing. They approach two older men having lunch.

SAM
Excuse me. Are you Ron Stubbins?

RON nods.

DEAN
You were friends with Jimmy Anderson?

RON
Who are you?

DEAN
We're Mr Anderson's insurance company. We're just here to dot 'I's' and cross 'T's'.

SAM
We were just wondering, had the deceased mentioned any unusual recent experiences?

RON
What do you mean, unusual?

SAM
Well visions, halluinations.

DEAN
It's part of a medical examination kind of thing. All very standard.

RON
What company did you say you were with?

DEAN
All National Mutual. Tell me, did he ever mention seeing a truck? A big black truck?

RON
What the hell you talking about? You even speaking English?

RON'S FRIEND
Son this truck, a big scary monster looking thing?

DEAN
Yeah actually, I think so.

FRIEND
Hmm.

DEAN
What?

Friend
I have heard of a truck like that.

SAM
You have. Where?

FRIEND
Not where. When. Back in the '60s there was a string of deaths. Black men. Story goes, they disappeared in a big, nasty, black truck.

DEAN
They ever catch the guy who did it?

FRIEND
Never found him. Hell, not sure they even really looked. See there was a time, this town wasn't too friendly to all it's citzens.

SAM
Thank you.

SAM and DEAN make their way back down the pier to the Impala.

DEAN
Truck.

SAM
Keeps coming up doesn't it?

DEAN
You know, I was thinking. You heard of the flying dutchman?

SAM
Yeah, a ghost ship, infused with the Captain's evil spirit. It was basically part of him.

DEAN
(Nodding) So what if we're dealing with the same thing? You know, a phantom truck, an extension of some bastard's ghost, re-enacting past crimes.

SAM
The victims have all been black men.

DEAN
I think it's more than that. They all seem connected to Cassie and her family.

SAM
All right. Well, you work that angle, go talk to her.

DEAN
Yeah I will.

SAM
Oh, and you might also wanna mention that other thing.

DEAN
What other thing?

SAM
The serious, unfinished business?

DEAN remains obstinately silent.

SAM
(huffs a laugh) Dean, what is going on between you two?

DEAN
All right, so maybe we were a little bit more involved than I said.

SAM
(staring at DEAN, waiting) Oh, Ok.

DEAN
OK, a lot more. Maybe. And I told her our secret, about what we do. And I shouldn't have.

SAM
Ah look man, everybody's gotta open up to someone sometime.

DEAN
Yeah I don't. It was stupid to get that close. I mean, look how it ended.

SAM smiles at DEAN.

DEAN
Would you stop!

SAM keeps staring and smiling.

DEAN
Blink or something!

SAM
You loved her.

DEAN
Oh God.

DEAN turns to the Impala.

SAM
You were in love with her, but you dumped her.

DEAN is silent. He stares at the ground, glances at SAM, then looks back to the ground.

SAM
Oh wow. She dumped you.

DEAN
Get in the car. (Getting in himself) Get in the car!

...........................

INTERIOR. CASSIE'S HOUSE.

CASSIE sits at the desk in the lounge. There is a knock at the door.

CASSIE
Dean!

DEAN
Hey.

CASSIE
Hey. Come on in.

DEAN
So...you busy, or...

Cassie
The paper's doing a tribute to Jimmy. I was just going through his stuff...his awards. Trying to find the words.

DEAN
That's gotta be tough.

CASSIE
For years this family owned the paper. The Dorians? They had a whites only policy. After they sold it Jimmy became the first black reporter. He didn't stop til he became editor. He taught me everything...(drifting off). Where's your brother?

DEAN
(Shrugging) Not here.

CASSIE
All right. So, uh, what brings you here?

DEAN
Trying to find the connection between the three victims. By the way, did you talk to your mum about, what Todd said about not being a racist?

CASSIE
I did. She didn't want to talk about it.

DEAN
Right.

A short silence.

DEAN
So just then, why did you ask where my brother was?

CASSIE
Nothing. Not important.

DEAN
Could it be because, without him here it's just you and me? Not you, me and Sam which would be easier?

CASSIE
It's not easier....Look, I...

DEAN
(Turning away) No. Forget it. It's fine. We'll keep it strictly business.

CASSIE
(Staring after him) I forgot you do that.

DEAN
Do what?

CASSIE
Oh. Whenever we get, what's the word....close? Anywhere in the neighbourhood of emotional vulnerability, you back off. Or make some joke. Or find any way to shut the door on me.

DEAN
(Offended and barking our a laugh) Oh that's hilarious. (walking back to stand in front of her) See, I'm not the one who took that big final door and slammed it behind me.

CASSIE
Ok wait a minute...

DEAN
And I'm not the one who took the key and buried it.

CASSIE
We done with this metaphor?

DEAN
Alls I'm saying is I was totally up front with you back then, and you nailed me for it.

CASSIE
The guy I'm with, the guy I'm hoping might be in my future, tells me he professionally pops ghosts.

DEAN
That's not the words I used!

CASSIE
And that he has to leave, to go work with his father.

DEAN
I did!

CASSIE
All I could think was, If you want out fine, but don't tell me this insane story.

DEAN
(Raising his voice and getting in her face) It was the truth Cassie, and I notice it didn't sound insane the minute you thought I could help you.

CASSIE
Well back then I thought you just wanted to dump me.

DEAN
Whoa! Now let's not forget who dumped who ok?

CASSIE
I thought it was what you wanted.

DEAN
Well it wasn't.

CASSIE
I didn't mean to hurt you.

DEAN
Well you did.

CASSIE
I'm sorry!

DEAN
Yeah me too.

They stare at each other, then start making out furiously. Switch to them falling into bed, making love.

MUSIC: Blind Faith - Can't Find My Way Home

END ACT TWO

...................

EXTERIOR. A BUILDING SITE.

The Mayor stands looking at plans. He folds them up and makes his way back to his car. Before he can get in the black truck pulls up behind him, reving it's engine. The Mayor starts to run down the road. The truck hits him, he falls down an embankment and rolls to a stop, obviously dead.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INTERIOR. CASSIE'S BED

Dean lies on his back, his arm around Cassie tucked against his side.

CASSIE
We should fight more often.

DEAN
(staring at the roof, absentmindedly running his fingers up and down her arm) Absolutely.

CASSIE
Actually we were always pretty good at fighting. (Indicating their position) This we were good at. It's all the other stuff...not so much.

DEAN
Hey I tried. I told you who I really was. That was a big first for me.

CASSIE
Why'd you tell me?

DEAN
I don't know. I guess I couldn't lie to you.

CASSIE
Dean. You told me that story...it scared the hell outta me. I thought you were nuts. Dangerous even. Actually, maybe I was looking for a reason to walk away.

DEAN
In my work....uh...I see some horrible things. Things that can't be explained. I deal with them. But working things out with you?

CASSIE
I'm a scary one all right.....well, usually things get worked out. When you really want them to.

DEAN
(Hesitantly) You know, I'm still really involved. With my dad's work.

CASSIE
(leaning up on one elbow to look down at DEAN) No more excuses ok? From you or me.

DEAN
Ok.

They start kissing. DEAN's phone rings and he reaches for it.

DEAN
Yeah.

DEAN listens. Looks startled.

You're kidding!

....................

EXTERIOR. FIELD.

It is snowing. DEAN approaches SAM, who is talking to a cop.

SAM
(putting away some sort of ID) He's with me.

The cop leaves. SAM turns to DEAN with a half smile.

SAM
Where were you last night? You didn't make it back to the hotel.

DEAN
Well...

SAM
I'm guessing you guys worked things out?

DEAN
We'll be working things out when we're ninety. So what happened?

SAM
Every bone crushed. Internal organ's turned to pudding. The cops are all stumped, it's like something ran him over.

DEAN
Something like a truck?

SAM
Yep.

DEAN
Tracks?

SAM
Nope.

DEAN
What was the Mayor doing here anyway?

SAM
He owned the property. Bought it a few weeks ago.

DEAN
But he's white, he doesn't fit the pattern.

SAM
Killings didn't happen up on the road. That doesn't fit either.

........................

INTERIOR. NEWSPAPER OFFICE.

CASSIE makes two mugs of tea and takes them over to where DEAN sits at a computer.

CASSIE
Here.

DEAN
Thanks. So I'm trying to find some link between those killings back in the '60s and what's going on now. There wasn't a lot about it in the paper.

CASSIE
Not surprising. Probably minimal policework too. Back then equal justice under the law wasn't too literal around here.

DEAN'S phone rings.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
(On phone) Ok, the courthouse records show that Mr and Mrs Mayor bought an abandoned property. The previous owner was the Dorian family for, like, 150 years.

DEAN
Dorian?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
(To Cassie) Didn't you say the Dorian family used to own this paper?

CASSIE
(Nodding) Along with everything else around here. Real pillars of the town.

DEAN
Right, right.

DEAN clicks a few links on the computer.

DEAN
That's interesting.

SAM
What?

DEAN
This Cyrus Dorian. He vanished in April of '63.The case was investigated but never solved. It was right around the time the string of murders was going on back then.

SAM
Well I pulled a bunch of papers up on the Dorian place, it musta been in bad shape when the Mayor bought.

DEAN
Why's that?

SAM
The first thing he did was bulldoze the place.

DEAN
(to Cassie) Mayor Todd knocked down the Dorian place?

CASSIE
It was a big deal. One of the oldest houses left. He made the front page.

DEAN
(To Sam) You got a date?

SAM
Ahhh. The 3rd of last month.

DEAN
(clicking, then reading from computer screen) Mayor Todd bulldozed the Dorian family home on the 3rd. The first killing was the very next day.

.........................

EXTERIOR. NIGHT. CASSIE'S HOUSE

Cassie wanders around with a glass of something. As she puts it down on the desk the lights flicker and she hears a reving engine outside. Headlights shine through the slats of the blinds and she hurriedly closes them. The truck starts making passes at the house and Cassie. terrified, runs from room to room closing the blinds. She races for her phone and dials a number.

CASSIE
Dean. DEAN!

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INTERIOR. CASSIE'S LOUNGE.

SAM hands her a cup of tea. DEAN sits beside her protectively.

CASSIE
(Hands shaking, rattling the cup) Maybe you could throw a couple of shots in that.

SAM
You didn't see who was driving the truck.

CASSIE
It seemed to be no one. Everything was moving so fast. And then it was just gone. Why didn't it kill us?

DEAN
Whoever was controlling the truck wants you afraid first.

SAM
Mrs Robinson, Cassie said that your husband saw the truck before he died.

MRS ROBINSON is shaking.

CASSIE
Mom?

MRS ROBINSON
Oh. Martin was under a lot of stress. You can't be sure about what he was seeing.

DEAN
Well after tonight I think we can be reasonably sure he was seeing a truck. What happened tonight, you and Cassie are marked. Ok? Your daughter could die. So if you know something now would be a really good time to tell us about it.

CASSIE
Dean..

MRS ROBINSON
Yes. Yes, he said he saw a truck.

SAM
Did he know who it belonged to?

MRS ROBINSON
He thought he did.

DEAN
Who was that?

MRS ROBINSON
(getting upset) Cyrus. A man named Cyrus.

SAM and DEAN look at each other, DEAN reaches for his bag and shows MRS ROBINSON the newspaper article about DORIAN'S death.

DEAN
Is this Cyrus?

MRS ROBINSON
Cyrus Dorian died more than 40 years ago.

DEAN
(softly) How do you know he died, Mrs Robinson? The paper's said he went missing. How do you know he died?

MRS ROBINSON We were all very young. I dated Cyrus a while, I was also seeing Martin...in secret of course. Inter-racial couples didn't go over too well back then. When I broke it off with Cyrus and when he found out about Martin, I don't know, he, changed. His hatred. His hatred was frightening.

SAM
The murders.

MRS ROBINSON
(sounding upset) There were rumours. People of colour disappearing into some kind of a truck. Nothing was ever done. Martin and a... Martin and I, we were gunna be, uh, married in that little church near here, but last minute we decided to elope as we didn't want the attention.

DEAN
And Cyrus?

MRS ROBINSON
(completely breaking down) The day we set for the wedding, was the day someone set fire to the church. There was a children's choir practising in there. They all died.

SAM
(softly) Did the attacks stop after that?

MRS ROBINSON
(Sobbing) No! There was one more. One night that truck came for Martin. Cyrus beat him something terrible. But Martin, you see, Martin got loose. And he started hitting Cyrus and he just kept hitting him and hitting him.

DEAN
Why didn't you call the cops?

MRS ROBINSON
(crying) This was forty years ago. He called on his friends, Clayton Soames and Jimmy Anderson, and they put Cyrus' body into the truck and they rolled it into the swamp at the end of his land and all three of them kept that secret all of these years.

SAM
And now all three are gone.

DEAN
And so is Mayor Todd. Now he said that you of all people would know he is not a racist. Why would he say that?

MRS ROBINSON
He was a good man. He was a young deputy back then investigating Cyrus' disappearence. Once he figured out what Martin and the others had done he...he did nothing, because he also knew what Cyrus had done.

CASSIE
Why didn't you tell me?

MRS ROBINSON
(Still crying) I thought I was protecting them. And now there's no one left to protect.

DEAN
Yes there is.

DEAN looks at Cassie. So does MRS ROBINSON, looking shaken.

....................

EXTERIOR. CASSIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

SAM leans against Impala, DEAN walks up and down.

SAM
Ah, my life was so simple. Just school, exams, papers on polycentric cultural norms.

DEAN
So I guess I saved you from a boring existence.

SAM
Yeah, occasionally I miss boring.

DEAN
So this killer truck.

SAM
I miss conversations that didn't start with 'this killer truck'. Ahhh

DEAN
(laughing a little) Well this Cyrus guy. Evil on a level that infected even his truck. When he died, the swamp became his tomb, and his spirit was dormant for 40 years.

SAM
So what woke it up?

DEAN
The construction on his house. Or the destruction.

SAM
Right. Demolition or remodelling can awaken spirits, make them restless.

DEAN
Mmm-hmm.

SAM
Like that theatre in Illinois, ya know?

DEAN
And the guy that tore down the family homestead, Harold Todd, is the same guy that kept Cyrus' murder quiet and unsolved.

SAM
So now his spirit is awakened and out for blood.

DEAN
Yeah I guess. Who knows what ghosts are thinking anyway.

SAM
You know we're going to have to dredge that body up from the swamp right.

DEAN smiles at him.

SAM
Man.

DEAN
You said it.

SAM
Yeah.

CASSIE approaches from the house. Dean stands.

DEAN
Hey.

CASSIE
Hey. She's asleep. Now what.

DEAN
Well you should stay put and look after her... and we'll be back. Don't leave the house.

CASSIE
(Smiling) Don't go getting all authoritative on me. I hate it.

DEAN glances behind him to SAM. SAM looks down, grinning.

DEAN
(Mumbling) Don't leave the house please?

CASSIE blinks slowly at DEAN and he leans in to kiss her, smiling.

SAM glances over, grinning at them making out, and clears his throat. DEAN keeps kissing CASSIE, holding one finger back at SAM to wait.

DEAN
(breaking his kiss) You comin' or what?

.............................

EXTERIOR. NIGHT. THE DORIAN PROPERTY.

SAM
All right. Let's get her up.

DEAN is at the wheel of a tractor. He backs it up, pulling a truck from the water.

SAM
All right. A little more. Little more. All right, stop.

DEAN turns off the engine and jumps down.

SAM
Nice.

DEAN
(moving to the trunk of the Impala) Hell yeah.

SAM
Now I know what she sees in you.

DEAN
(rummaging among the weapons) What?

SAM
Come on man, you can admit it. You're still in love with her.

DEAN
Ahh, can we focus please.

SAM
I'm just saying Dean.

DEAN
(handing SAM something from the trunk) Hold that.

SAM
All right. What am I getting?

DEAN
(In business mode) Gas. Flashlight...

SAM
Got it. got it.

DEAN
Ok, let's get this done.

SAM
All right.

DEAN
(Lowering the trunk of the Impala)Got it.

They move toward the door of the truck, glance at each other. DEAN opens it. A decayed body falls out.

.......................

EXTERIOR. NIGHT. DORIAN PROPERTY.

DEAN
All right let's get to it.

They salt and burn the body and stand watching.

SAM
Think that'll do it?

The ghost truck appears, headlights come on and engine reving.

DEAN
I guess not.

END OF ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXTERIOR. NIGHT. DORIAN PROPERTY.

SAM
So burning the body had no effect on that thing?

DEAN
Sure it did. Now it's really pissed.

SAM
But Cyrus' ghost is gone, right Dean?

DEAN
(starting to walk away) Apparently not the part that's fused with the truck.

SAM
Where you going?

DEAN
Goin' for a little ride.

SAM
What!

DEAN
Gonna lead that thing away. That busted piece of crap, you gotta burn it.

SAM
How the hell am I supposed to burn a truck Dean?

DEAN
I don't know. Figure something out.

SAM
(catching the bag Dean throws at him) Figure some -- something -- (Sam sputters)

DEAN reverses the Impala and takes off. The ghost truck roars after him. SAM hides until it has passed. DEAN and the Impala lead the truck on a wild ride through the misty back roads.

SAM'S phone rings.

Hey, you gotta give me a minute.

DEAN
I don't have a minute. What are we doing?

SAM
Ahh. Let me get back to you. (he hangs up)

DEAN
(astounded) Get back to me?

SAM
(On phone again) Hey Cassie? Hey, it's Sam, I need some information and it has to be exactly right.

SAM
(back on the phone with DEAN) All right, Dean?

DEAN
This better be good.

SAM
Where are you?

DEAN
In the middle of no where with a killer truck on my ass! It's like it knows I put the torch to Cyrus.

SAM
Listen to me, this is important. I have to know exactly where you are.

DEAN
(Looking at a road sign as the Impala roars passed) Decatur road, about two miles off the highway.

SAM
Ok. Headed East?

DEAN
Yes!

The Truck backends the Impala, which goes skidding all over the road before regaining traction.

DEAN
You son of a bitch!

SAM
Ok, ahhh, turn right! Up ahead, turn right.

DEAN swings right, the truck follows, both engines screaming and revving.

SAM
You make the turn?

DEAN
Yeah I made the turn! You need to move this thing along a little faster.

SAM
All right, you see a road up ahead?

DEAN
No! Wait. No, yes, I see it.

The truck is slowly gaining ground on the Impala's left side.

SAM
Ok, Turn left.

DEAN
Wha...?

Grimacing, DEAN slams on the brakes and the truck careens past as he spins the Impala left onto the smaller road.

DEAN
All right, now what?

SAM
You need to go seven tenths of a mile and then stop.

DEAN
Stop?

SAM
Exactly seven tenths Dean.

DEAN
(looking at the speedometer) Seven tenths, seven tenths.

At the right moment DEAN spins the car around and moves it back to sit exactly where SAM advised, facing back the way he had come. He is between two posts on each side of the road and the last remains of a wall, almost totally broken down. The ghost truck appears back down the road he came down, revving it's engine.

SAM
Dean, You still there?

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
What's happening?

DEAN
It's just staring at me, what do I do?

SAM
Just what you are doing, bringing it to you.

Dean
Wha...

The truck spins it's tyres and comes barreling toward DEAN and the Impala. DEAN watches it come, hanging tightly to the Impala's steering wheel.

DEAN
Come on Come on.

As it reaches him he closes his eyes and hangs on tight. The truck roars through him, disintegrating into nothing as it does so. DEAN opens his eyes and stares at the now empty road in front of him. All that can be heard is the purring of the Impala's engine, the truck's revving having completely disappeared. DEAN twists quickly to look behind and sees nothing.

SAM
Dean. You still there? Dean?

DEAN
(looking shocked) Where'd it go?

SAM
Dean, you're where the church was.

DEAN
What church!

SAM
The place Cyrus burned down. Murdered all those kids.

DEAN
(looking at the posts left on the side of the road) There's not a whole lot left.

SAM
Church ground is hallowed ground, whether the church is still there or not. Evil spirits cross over hallowed ground, sometimes they're destroyed, so I figured, maybe, that would get rid of it.

DEAN
Maybe? Maybe!! What if you were wrong?

SAM
Huh. Honestly that thought hadn't occurred to me.

DEAN
(Stares at his phone, then hangs up. Mimics) Well it honestly didn't occur to me. (DEAN slaps the steering wheel) I'm gonna kill him.

..........................

EXTERIOR. DAY. THE DOCKS.

DEAN and CASSIE walk toward the Impala, SAM is already in the driver's seat.

CASSIE
My mother says to tell you thanks again.

DEAN nods and they come to a stop beside the Impala, facing each other.

CASSIE
This is a better goodbye than last time.

DEAN
Yeah well maybe this time it will be a little less permanent.

CASSIE
You know what? I'm a realist. I don't see much hope for us Dean.

DEAN
Well I've seen stranger things happen. A hell of a lot stranger.

CASSIE
Good bye Dean.

DEAN
I'll see ya Cassie....I will.

They kiss, and stare into each others eyes. DEAN gets in the car, SAM and CASSIE wave and the Impala takes off.

......................

EXTERIOR. LONG COUNTRY ROAD

DEAN stares out the window while SAM drives.

SAM
I like her.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
You meet someone like her, doesn't it makes you wonder if it's worth it? Putting everything else on hold, doing what we do?

DEAN looks at SAM for a long moment, then smiles and reaches for his sunglasses, which he slips on.

DEAN
Why don't you wake me up when it's my turn to drive?

DEAN slouches down in the seat with a sigh. SAM shakes his head and looks back at the long straight road.

The Impala cruises.
