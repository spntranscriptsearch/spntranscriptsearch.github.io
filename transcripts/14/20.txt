TEASER
(In the basement of the bunker, Jack is standing amid the rubble of the exploded Ma'lak Box. The emergency lights are glowing and smoke swirls around. Jack is in shadow in the middle of it all, his eyes glowing red. An alarm is blaring)

JACK:

You lied to me.

CASTIEL:

Jack.

JACK: (yelling)

You lied!

(Jack throws out his arms and a concussion blast throws Sam, Dean and Castiel across the room, crashing into the shelves at the back of the room. The alarm continues to blare in the background.

ALL:

-No! -No! (Grunts)

(They look around the room and Jack is gone)

ACT ONE
(Still in the basement)

CASTIEL:

I don't understand.

The Ma'lak box can hold an archangel.

SAM:

Jack's not an archangel.

DEAN:

Yeah, apparently, the kid leveled up.

CASTIEL:

So, what do we do?

DEAN:

We find him.

CASTIEL:

How?

DEAN: (angrily)

I don't know, Cas. You tell me.

SAM:

Okay, the last time we found Jack, it wa—it was by praying to him, but that's not gonna happen again.

DEAN:

Yeah, you think?

CASTIEL:

You should never have tried to lock him away.

DEAN:

You know what? You're right.

I never wanted to put him in that damn box.

I wanted him dead.

CASTIEL:

Dean.

DEAN:

He's dangerous, Cas, and you knew it!

You've known it for a long time!

But that's okay. You know why?

Because me and Sam, we've killed just about everything there is.

And this -- Jack -- oh, we'll find a way.

Because he's just another monster.

CASTIEL:

You don't mean that.

DEAN:

The hell I don't.

(Dean and Cas stare each other down for a moment and then Cas storms out of the room)

DEAN:

All right. So, I guess we got to find Jack.

SAM:

Yeah. Then what?

DEAN:

I don't know.

Maybe we call Rowena, see if she can put together one of those, um, "soul bombs."

SAM:

The...thing you were gonna use against the Darkness?

(DEAN:

Yeah, might actually put a dent in the kid.

SAM: (looking troubled)

Okay. (quietly)

DEAN:

Sam, I know this isn't easy, okay?

He -- I know how much he meant to you.

He meant a lot to me.

He was family.

But this?

This is not Jack anymore.

He's hurting, he's killing people.

This isn't gonna be easy, but we're gonna have to do the hard thing.

We're gonna have to do the ugly thing.

(Sam sighs)

DEAN:

Ain't like it's the first time, though, right?

(Jack is walking down a city street. Several people are having conversations as he passed)

MAN #1: (On the phone with a woman on his arm)

No, honey, it's not like that.

She's just a friend from work.

MAN #2: (Sitting on a bench talking with a woman)

You should've seen it. I caught a steelhead this big.

I mean it.

WOMAN #1: (off-screen)

We went up to the cabin...

WOMAN #2:

Oh, my God. She's such a bitch.

MAN #3: (sitting at a café table with another ma)

Baby, it's not you. It's me.

(More indistinct conversations)

MAN #4:

No, I don't think he took offense. You're awesome.

WOMAN #3: (sitting with boy and husband on a bench)

Just because Mommy and Daddy aren't gonna be together, we still love you.

MAN #5:

I saw 'em at Coachella last year!

DAD WITH WIFE AND BOY:

Nothing's gonna change. OFF SCREEN:

Greatest company to work for.

MAN #6:

You won't be disappointed. MAN #7:

I don't have any problem with those.

-You're my best friend. TALL WOMAN:

Your, um...profile said 6'1".

SHORT MAN:

I am. Basically.

OFF SCREEN:

-You're finally getting a break. -It's good to see you.

-Come on, baby. JACK (to himself)

Why does everyone...

MAN #8:

That's not porn. I-I don't know what that was.

(Indistinct conversations continue)

JACK: (turns to face the people he just passed, eyes glowing yellow)

Stop lying!

(Conversations stop for a second and then resume)

(The Impala pulls up in front of the ‘Mirror Universe’ building, engine rumbling)

SAM: (in the car, on the phone)

Yeah, I know it's a long shot, Rowena, but just try, okay? I mean, try.

(Sam exhales sharply)

DEAN:

She in?

SAM:

She thinks it's dangerous and insane.

But, yeah, she's in.

DEAN:

Well, she knows what Jack's capable of.

(Sam smirks and they get out of the car)

(As Sam and Dean enter the building a man on a scooter rides past them)

MAN ON SCOOTER:

Excuse me.

Coming through.

(Sam and Dean look around the office as the walk towards the receptionist. Indistinct office conversations occur around them)

DEAN:

Nerds.

SAM:

Takes one to know one.

DEAN:

What?

SAM:

You. Come on, man. You're always calling me a geek, but you know every word to every Led Zeppelin song -- backwards and forwards -- you can discuss in detail every major rock drummer between '67 and '84, and... you watch "Jeopardy!" every night.

DEAN:

Okay. All right, yeah.

But I'm nothing like these, uh, you know, gaggle of Zuckerbergs.

SAM:

Th-They're not -- (Scoffs)

Mirror Universe builds facial-recognition software.

They've got contracts with -- with basically every law-enforcement agency on the planet.

DEAN:

Okay. So?

SAM:

So w-we need to track Jack, but he flies, so if we can't go ahead and track his license plate, maybe we can track his --

DEAN:

His face.

SAM:

His face, exactly.

DEAN:

Okay.

Oh, I got this.

(Dean approaches the receptionist, showing his FBI badge)

WOMAN:

Can I help you?

DEAN:

Hi. I'm Dean Winchester, and I'm looking for the devil's son.

WOMAN & DEAN:

-What? -What?

DEAN:

Uh -- (Dean chuckles)

DEAN:

I meant [Clears throat]

I'm Dean Winchester, and I'm looking for the devil's son.

This badge is fake.

(Dean laughs nervously)

Excuse me.

(Dean walks away, passing two men walking through the office)

WORKER #1:

Hey. I'm sleeping with your wife.

WORKER #2:

I know. Kind of into it.

WORKER #1:

What?

(Sam, hearing the men, exhales sharply)

DEAN:

Hey, let me ask you a question. Tell me who your favorite singer is.

SAM:

What?

DEAN:

You...

Look, I know you say it's Elvis, but we both know that's crap, so tell me who your favorite singer is.

SAM:

Well, it's like you said.

(Chuckles) It's Celine Dion.

Uh...

I mean Celine Dion.

It's Celi--

(Sam stammers)

Dean, every time I try and say "Elvis," it comes out --

DEAN:

The sad, horrible truth.

Yeah. You know why?

Because we can't lie.

WORKER #3: (walking angrily onto the office floor)

All right!

Who ate my yogurt?!

WORKER #4:

Right here!

WORKER #3:

I knew it was you! That was the third --

Son of a bitch!

(The worker runs toward the man and tackles him to the ground)

WORKER #4

No!

SAM:

Guess we're not the only ones.

(Indistinct shouting)

WORKER #5: (yelling into the phone)

Double?! You make double?

And that was my parking space! (yelling at coworker walking by)

WORKER #6:

I hate everyone!

WORKER #2:

I can't believe you taped it!

WORKER #1: (running across the office)

I thought it was hot!

(Workers are shouting, fighting and throwing things at each other)

DEAN:

Let’s go.

(Sam and Dean run into a conference room while the shouting and fighting continues. The news is playing on the television)

NEWSCASTER:

In what was supposed to be a speech on farming subsidies, the President instead spent more than two hours disclosing his entire tax history, deep ties to Russia and North Korea, and a quote "demon deal" he made with someone named Crowley.

DEAN:

Dude. What the hell?

FEMALE NEWSCASTER:

Over to you, Jack.

DEAN:

Did we just walk into a case?

(Shouting continues in distance)

FEMALE NEWSCASTER:

Jack?

JACK (NEWSCASTER):

I love you.

I've always loved you.

(Shouting continues outside the conference room))

FEMALE NEWSCASTER:

Pundits on both sides of the aisle --

SAM:

Okay, Dean.

I think whatever is happening here, i-it's not just happening here.

DEAN:

Yeah, no, it's -- it's everywhere, but what...

SAM:

Jack.

(Shouting continues)

DEAN:

Son of a bitch. We have to find him.

MAN:

I hate everyone!

DEAN:

Like right now.

-I hate this!

-I am the stapler queen. (Woman is walking around the office stealing her coworkers' staplers)

I am the stapler queen.

I am the stapler queen!

(Castiel is standing in an alley, looking through a small window in a door. Sirens are wailing and helicopter blades are whirring in the background)

CASTIEL:

I need to go to hell.

DEMON: (on the other side of the door)

You mean, like, metaphorically or...

CASTIEL:

No. Literally.

And I understand you can take me.

DEMON:

Really?

'Cause from what I remember, you've been to hell -- more than once.

CASTIEL:

Well this, this -- it's different.

I need time to see the Cage and study it.

DEMON:

Yeah, that's a no.

So you can go to hell -- metaphorically.

CASTIEL:

No, don't.

(The demon slams the door to the window shut. A voice is heard behind Cas)

VOICE:

Wow. Yeah.

(Castiel turns around to find Chuck standing behind him)

CHUCK:

You guys are screwed.

(A car horn honks in distance)

ACT TWO
(Scene opens on a door from inside a house. There is a knock on door and a woman answers)

JACK:

Hello.

MRS. KLINE (looking apprehensive)

Oh, hi.

JACK:

I'm Jack.

MRS. KLINE:

I remember.

JACK:

Well, good.

(Jack pushes past her and walks into the house)

(Back in the alley)

CASTIEL:

God.

CHUCK:

Eh...

CASTIEL: (rolling his eyes)

Chuck.

CHUCK:

There you go.

CASTIEL:

Is it really...

CASTIEL:

How are You here?

CHUCK:

You called me?

(Flashback to Castiel in Orlando's Emporium holding the amulet and praying to God)

CASTIEL:

God...

I don't know where you are.

I don't know if you can hear me.

But please.

Sam, Dean -- we need you.

(Siren wailing in distance)

CASTIEL: (questioningly)

My prayer?

That's why you're here.

CHUCK:

Yeah.

Well, that and...him.

Jack.

He's a problem.

(At the Kline house -- Jack and Mrs. Kline are standing in the entryway))

JACK:

I don't mean to bother you, but we talked before, and I liked that talk, and I thought we could just maybe talk again... maybe about your daughter.

MRS. KLINE:

No.

JACK: (Chuckles softly-confused)

I don't understand.

MRS. KLINE:

You lied to us.

You said you worked with Kelly, but after you left, my husband and I, we made some calls, and no one knows who you are.

JACK:

I...

I didn't.

MRS. KLINE:

Yes, you did.

Kelly's not away on some "secret mission."

She...

(Crying)

They think she's dead.

What did you do to my daughter?!

(yelling) What did you do?!

JACK: (angrily, eyes glowing)

Stop!

(Sam and Dean are still in the conference room at Mirror Industries. Indistinct shouting can be heard in the distance. Sam is bringing up Jack's face on a video screen)

DEAN: (looking at his phone)

When people can't lie, the Internet gets real quiet.

(Liquid hits the window to the room with a thud)

(Shouting continues)

DEAN:

Hmm.

Yeah, guess your life isn't so perfect after all, EightPackMommy.

SAM:

What?

DEAN:

Yeah, she's got this blog.

Yeah, you know what?

Your kids aren't that cute.

And that gluten-free popover looks like crap because there's no gluten in it.

(Chuckling)

(to Sam) You know what I mean?

(Shouting continues)

DEAN:

I'll stop talking.

SAM:

Probably a good plan.

(Out in the office, it's chaos as the workers are still fighting)

WORKER #4:

You're losing your mind over one yogurt!

WORKER #3 (yelling)

It was three yogurts!

WORKER #7 (in a singsong voice)

I hate everyone!

I hate everyone!

WORKER #5 (crying)

I just want to be loved.

WORKER #7

I hate everyone!

I hate everyone!

OFF SCREEN:

I just want a sweet life.

WORKERS #7

I hate everyone!

(Chuck and Castiel are watching the chaos)

CHUCK:

See, this is why people need to lie.

-I hate everyone!

CHUCK:

It's good. Keeps the peace, you know?

-(Crying)

-I hate everyone!

CASTIEL:

Seems like an odd stance for...you.

-I hate everyone!

CHUCK:

Is it?

I'm a writer.

Lying's kind of what we do.

-I just want to be loved!

-I hate everyone!

CASTIEL: (walking through the office calling for Sam and Dean)

Sam! -I hate everyone!

Dean!

I hate every...

SAM:

Cas?

(Dean open the door to the conference room and gestures to Cas)

DEAN:

Cas.

How'd you get here?

CASTIEL:

He brought me.

(Cas walks into the room and gestures behind him)

CHUCK:

Hey, guys.

(Sam and Dean look at Chuck in disbelief)

(Scene switches to Jack walking out of the Kline house. He runs down the walkway, glancing over his shoulder towards the house)

(Back at Mirror Industries)

CHUCK:

I know what you're thinking -- it's been awhile, and I still look pretty good.

SAM: (stammering)

No, that's -- that's not what we were thinking.

DEAN:

Where the hell have you been?

CHUCK: (sitting down)

Well, you know, it's a funny story.

It reminds me of a song.

(Chuck reaches down beside him, picks up a guitar and plays a few notes)

DEAN: (grabs the guitar and smashes it on the floor, several times)

Answer the damn question!

CHUCK: (yells and points at Dean)

Don't!

CHUCK: (smiling)

It's a little cramped in here, don't you think?

(Chuck snaps his fingers and they are all transported to the map room in the bunker)

CHUCK:

There. That's better.

So...how's things?

Okay, look. I get it.

All right, I'm from the deus from the machina, and you have questions.

So, great. Go.

SAM:

Yeah, like Dean said, where have you been?

CHUCK: (sighing)

It's hard to explain.

Um...everywhere and nowhere, to the edge of the universe and beyond.

And I saw Springsteen on Broadway. Man's a genius.

DEAN:

What about Amara?

CHUCK:

She's been with me.

Yeah, it's been nice reconnecting after the whole "trying to murder me and end all existence" thing.

CASTIEL:

Where is she now?

CHUCK:

Reno.

Turns out she loves keno.

DEAN:

And you're here because...

CAS:

Because of Jack.

CHUCK:

Listen, you guys know me.

I'm hands-off.

I built the sandbox -- you play in it.

You want to fight Leviathans?

Cool. You got that.

You want to go up against -- what was it? -- the "British Men of Letters"?

Okay.

Little weak, but okay.

But when things get really bad, like the Apocalypse or the Other Apocalypse, that's when I have to step in.

SAM:

So you're saying Jack is Apocalyptic?

CHUCK:

The kid said, "Stop lying," and I don't know if you noticed, but the world kinda went insane.

(Chuck flicks his hand end a radio in the bunker turns on. He twirls his finger in a circle and the radio switched through various stations)

REPORTER:

...rioting in the streets as the Dow drops nearly 15,000 points.

(Radio tuning)

(Woman speaking German)- The purge is real

(Radio tuning)

(Woman speaking Spanish)- Stay in your homes! I repeat! It's too dangerous!

(Radio tuning)

(Woman speaking Chinese dialect)- The state is a lie.

(Radio tuning)

WOMAN:

And it's been confirmed -- the Queen of England is, in fact, a lizard.

MAN:

Inside --

(Chuck gestures again and the radio clicks off)

CHUCK:

See?

CAS:

Can you fix it?

CHUCK: (Sighs)

Fine.

(Snaps fingers)

Fixed.

(Stammers)

SAM

Really?

CHUCK:

I'm God, Sam.

Yeah, really.

Go ahead. Try it out.

DEAN:

Celine Dion rocks.

Yeah.

Yeah, we can lie again.

CAS:

And the rioting?

CHUCK:

Like it never happened.

(Out on the office floor)

WORKER #1:

Hey!

Who ate my yogurt?!

(Worker #2 is bringing the spoon of yogurt to his mouth. He lowers his hand as Worker #1 yells about his yogurt. All other workers go about their business)

WORKER #1

Dicks.

CHUCK:

You're welcome.

(Clears throat)

Look, the point is the kid did all that with two words.

What's next? He sneezes and -- whoops -- there goes India?

I don't know. Maybe.

But this is bad -- like Me Level Bad.

SAM:

Can you stop him?

CHUCK:

Not exactly.

But you can.

With that.

(Chuck motions to a gun laying on the map table)

ACT THREE
CAS:

What is that?

CHUCK:

I'm thinking of calling it... the Equalizer!

Or... the Hammurabi.

(Silence)

No?

All right, cool.

That's cool. Cool.

DEAN:

Wait, y-you're saying that this thing could kill Jack?

CHUCK:

That?

That'll kill anything.

SAM: (annoyed)

So you've had this the whole time and -- and we're just now getting it?

Why?

CHUCK:

Because I haven't?

I just made that sucker.

Hasn't been fired yet.

CAS:

So you don't even know if it works.

CHUCK:

If I say it'll work, it'll work.

DEAN:

There's no bullets.

CHUCK:

Right, it doesn't exactly use bullets.

See, existence is all about balance, right?

Dark and light, good and evil, chocolate and peanut butter.

SAM:

Ugh, yeah, okay, Chuck. The point, please?

CHUCK:

Right.

So, this doesn't so much fire bullets as it sends a wave of multi-dimensional energy across a perfectly balanced quantum link between whoever's shooting it and whoever they're shooting at.

(Castiel, Sam and Dean look perplexed)

CAS:

What?

CHUCK: (Sighs)

Uh, whatever happens to the person you're aiming at also happens to you.

So you kill him...

DEAN: (clicks the magazine into the gun)

You die.

CHUCK:

Right. Yeah.

Look, I know it's not perfect, and I'd do it myself, but, you know, if I bite it, then...existence also kind of bites it, so one of you...

Sorry.

CAS:

I don't understand why we're talking about killing Jack.

Y-You can fix him.

You can --

You can restore his soul.

That's why I called you.

CHUCK:

Yeah, not so much.

SAM:

You're God.

CHUCK:

Well, souls are complicated -- even for me.

Besides, even if I could, would you really want -- I mean, after what he did?

CASTIEL:

Then we bind him.

We throw him in the Cage until --

DEAN:

Stop, Cas.

You heard him.

This is the only way.

CAS:

And Billie said the only way to defeat Michael was to lock you in a box.

CHUCK:

Ugh. Billie.

I liked the old Death better.

He was all about fried pickles and tickle porn.

This new Death -- she's always sticking her scythe where it doesn't belong.

CAS:

There has to be another way.

DEAN:

Well, there's not.

Now, I know you don't like it, and I don't really care.

'Cause you just heard it from God Himself that this (picking up the gun) is the only thing that can kill Jack, so either get on board, or walk away.

(Cas leaves the room)

(Jack is walking quickly down a street. In his mind he hears Mrs. Kline)

HELEN: What did you do to my daughter?!

(Flashback to the Kline’s house)

MRS. KLINE: (yelling)

What did you do?!

JACK:

Stop!

(Dean is in his room in the bunker pouring alcohol into a flask. We hear footsteps and a knock on the door)

SAM: (walking into the room)

Dean?

DEAN:

Yeah. Over here.

Hey.

DEAN:

Good, I'm glad you're here.

I actually needed to talk to you about something.

Um...

Have a seat.

SAM:

Yeah.

Uh...what's going on?

DEAN:

You know what I'm gonna say.

SAM:

Let me guess.

This is where you tell me you're gonna pull the trigger?

DEAN:

Yeah, it is.

We don't have a choice, Sam.

SAM:

Of course, we do. Don't we always?

I mean, isn't that the point of everything we've ever done, that we always have a choice?

DEAN:

He killed our mom.

SAM: I get it. I was mad, too.

Or you know what?

Hell, I'm still mad.

And a part of me wants Jack dead -- it really does.

But, Dean, we haven't even tried to save him.

DEAN:

S-- Okay.

You heard him, right?

He actually blamed Mom for what happened.

SAM:

He doesn't have a soul.

DEAN:

And whose fault is that?

SAM:

Mine.

I'm the one who brought him back, and I brought him back because he's family.

DEAN:

Okay.

SAM:

And then he came back, and he burned his soul off to save us -- you and me.

And now what? You...

Now you -- you want my permission?

(Stammers)

You want me to say I'm cool with losing him and losing you all at once?

'Cause I can't do that.

I won't say that, 'cause I...

(getting emotional)

No.

I've already lost too much.

(Sam leaves Dean’s room)

(A white pick-up truck drives into a cemetery and Cas gets out. He looks around and then slams his fist onto the hood of the truck. There is a whooshing sound behind him.)

CASTIEL:

Jack.

JACK:

I've been looking for you.

(Cas moves forward and hugs Jack)

(In the bunker, Chuck is looking (and playing with) an archangel blade)

CHUCK:

I haven't seen one of these in forever.

Where'd you get it?

SAM:

Another world.

CHUCK:

Oh. Right.

SAM:

So...

How many are there -- how many other worlds or -- or universes or realities or whatever?

CHUCK:

I don't know.

Kinda lost count.

Most of them are boring.

One's in reverse.

In one, there's no yellow.

(Chuckles) One – One of them's just all squirrels.

SAM:

So, Michael said that you create these worlds and you just toss them away like failed versions of some book.

CHUCK:

And you believe him?

SAM:

Was he lying?

Is that what you're doing to us?

CHUCK:

No. Sam... you and your brother, of all the Sams and Deans in all the multiverse, you're my favorite.

You're just so interesting.

I mean, like that thing that happened at the office earlier today -- that was crazy, right?

(Cas and Jack are walking in the cemetery)

JACK:

And I thought I could make the world a better place if people couldn't lie.

CAS:

Well, it didn't.

JACK:

It really didn't.

And I went to see my grandparents.

CAS:

The Kline's.

JACK:

Yeah, I thought they liked me.

Maybe they'd still like me.

CAS:

And?

JACK:

My grandmother said I killed her -- my mom.

And I did.

Just by being born.

CAS:

Jack...

JACK:

I used to hate myself for it.

But I don't feel that way anymore.

(They stop walking. Birds are chirping, cawing)

I don't feel anything.

CAS:

After she said that, what did you do?

I just...

(Flashback to the Kline's house)

MRS. KLINE:

What did you do?!

JACK:

Stop!

Just stop.

What?

What are you?!

(Jack hesitates and his eyes return to normal. He looks troubled and then walks past Mrs. Kline, and out of the house)

(Mrs. Kline gasps as she watches him leave)

(Back in the cemetery)

JACK:

I ran.

(Cas reaches out and pats Jack on the shoulder)

(In the bunker library)

SAM:

Do you watch us?

When you're not here, are -- are you... watching us?

CHUCK:

Yeah.

(Exhales deeply)

I mean, you're my favorite show.

SAM:

Then why don't you do something?

If I had your power --

CHUCK:

Sam.

We talked about this.

Not the way it works.

SAM:

(Sighs)

Wait a second.

Why, when the chips are down, when the world is -- is failing, why does it always have to be on us?!

CHUCK:

Because you're my guys.

But right now, we need to focus on Jack.

Ah, that kid.

(Breathes deeply)

Whew!

SAM:

Wait a second.

You're scared of him.

CHUCK:

Aren't you?

SAM:

Do you know where he is?

CHUCK:

I do.

SAM:

Then what are you waiting for?

CHUCK:

Oh. Nothing.

Dean's already gone. (gesturing over his shoulder)

(Cas and Jack are sitting on a concrete bench in the cemetery)

JACK:

Mary was a mistake.

But ever since then, I've tried to do the right thing -- except for Dumah.

CASTIEL:

She, um...

She led you astray.

JACK:

And then I tried on my own, but every time I try, it -- it never goes right.

It never...

(Bell tolling in distance)

(Birds chirping)

All I ever wanted was to be good.

(Birds cawing)

But now I'm just... empty.

Even this -- I know you're here because you love me, and I want to love you back. It's just...

...I can't.

CASTIEL:

You can't yet.

We just need time to fix this. We need to go somewhere safe, somewhere where no one can find us.

(Suspenseful music plays)

(Jack looks up to see Dean standing near them with the gun in his hand)

ACT FOUR
(Cas stands up to block Jack as Dean approaches)

DEAN: Cas, step aside.

CASTIEL:

Dean.

DEAN:

Step aside!

CASTIEL:

Jack, go.

Run.

JACK: (standing up)

I can't.

CASTIEL:

You have to.

JACK:

I won't run anymore.

(Jack’s eyes glow yellow and he throws Cas out of the way. Cas groans as he lands on the ground and rolls)

JACK:

You're not gonna lock me up again, are you?

DEAN:

No.

(Dean raises the gun, aims at Jack and exhales deeply. Jack kneels down and bows his head. Dean, looking puzzled, lowers the gun and walks closer towards Jack. When he's right in front of Jack, he aims the gun directly at his head. At this moment Sam comes speeding into the cemetery, car tires screeching. He gets out of the car and starts running towards Dean and Jack)

SAM:

Dean?

Dean!

JACK: (to Dean)

I understand.

(Sam is still running, yelling for Dean. The music is getting more suspenseful as Dean holds his aim steady at Jack)

SAM:

Dean, don't!

Dean?

Dean!

JACK:

I know what I've done.

SAM:

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Dean!

Hey, hey, hey! Dean!

DEAN:

Stay back, Sam!

SAM:

(Panting)

JACK:

And you were right all along.

(Chuck comes up alongside Sam)

I am a monster.

SAM: (to Chuck)

Do something.

You're enjoying this.

CHUCK:

Shh.

(Dramatic music plays)

(Dean cocks the gun. He looks Jack in the eye for several seconds and then slowly lowers the gun. At this point, Castiel also comes running towards the area)

(Dean uncocks the gun and tosses it to the side)

CHUCK:

No.

Pick it up!

Pick it up.

DEAN:

The hell, Chuck?

CHUCK:

This isn't how the story is supposed to end.

CAS:

The story?

CHUCK: (frustrated)

Lookit, the -- the -- the gathering storm, the gun, the -- the father killing his own son.

This is Abraham and Isaac.

This is epic!

DEAN:

Wait.

What are you saying?

SAM:

He's saying he's been playing us.

This whole time.

CHUCK:

Come on.

SAM:

Our entire lives.

Mom, Dad -- everything.

This is all you because you wrote it all, right?

Because -- Because what?

Because we're your favorite show?

Because we're part of your story?

CHUCK:

Okay, Dean, no offense, but your brother is stupid and crazy.

And that kid is still dangerous.

So pick up the gun.

Pick it up... pull the trigger... and I'll bring her back.

Your mom.

DEAN:

No.

(Dean takes a few steps back to stand side by side with Sam)

No.

My mom was my hero.

And I miss her, and I will miss her every second of my life, but she would not want this.

And it's not like you even really care.

'Cause Sam's right.

The Apocalypse, the first go-around, with Lucifer and Michael -- you knew everything that was going on, so why the games, Chuck, huh?

Why don't You just snap your fingers and end it?!

CHUCK:

Look, I --

SAM:

And every other bad thing we've been killing, been dying over -- (scoffs) where were you?

Just sitting back and watching us suffer so we can do this over and over and over again -- fighting, losing people we love?

When does it end?

Tell me.

CHUCK:

Dean, don't do this.

DEAN:

No, we're done talking.

'Cause this -- this isn't just a story.

It's our lives!

So God or no God, you go to hell.

CHUCK:

(Chuckles lightly)

Have it your way.

(Chuck snaps his fingers and Jack screams, light emanating from his eyes and mouth, as if he was stabbed with an angel blade. He falls to the ground, screaming and gasping. Castiel comes over and kneels next to him)

CAS:

Jack.

(Screaming)

Jack!

(Groaning)

Jack!

DEAN:

Stop it.

Stop it!

(Dean lunges forward. Chuck pushes his hand in front of him and Dean goes flying backwards, crashing into a tombstone)

(Jack continues screaming and groaning as Cas tries to heal him by placing his fingertips on Jack's forehead)

SAM:

Jack.

(Sam looks around sees the gun on the ground. He picks it up and yells for Chuck)

Hey, Chuck!

Hey, Chuck!

(Sam aims the gun at Chuck and fires)

ACT FIVE
(Sam fires the gun at Chuck. Chuck gets hit in the shoulder while Sam simultaneously gets hit in the shoulder, falling to the ground)

SAM:

Aah!

(Groaning)

CHUCK: (angrily)

Fine!

That's the way you want it?

Story's over.

Welcome to The End.

(The day suddenly turns to night. Dean sees Sam on the ground and gets up to walk over to him)

DEAN:

Hey, you okay?

SAM:

Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

(Sam struggles to his feet. Castiel is nearby, sitting on the ground next to Jack)

SAM:

Wait. I thought Chuck said that the gun was the only thing that could...

(indicating Jack, who is dead on the ground, eyes burned out)

CAS:

He's a writer.

Writers lie.

GIRL #1:

Do you think it's --

Do you think it's expensive?

GIRL #2:

Honestly, it might be.

I think so.

GIRL #1:

Okay, let's look.

(The girls both laugh. As they walk away from the mirror, a woman appears on the other side of it. There is blood dripping from her eyes. She puts her hand on the mirror and frost appears)
