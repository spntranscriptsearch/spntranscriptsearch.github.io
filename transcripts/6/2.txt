NOW

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

A fireplace. Pictures of a family line the mantle. A bloody hand enters the shot and smashes one of the framed pictures. The hand belongs to a woman, the WIFE in the picture, who is gasping for breath as she runs, holding a BABY to her chest. She runs up a flight of stairs and into a room. She closes the door and grabs a phone from a nearby table. She tries to call for help, but gets a dial tone. She hears footsteps outside the door and crawls under the bed with the BABY. She hears doors opening and closing through the house as the footsteps come closer. Boots can be seen stopping under the crack of the door. Once they move past, she looks on the other side of the bed, and sees her HUSBAND lying dead on the floor, his throat cut and bloody. She cries out and then covers her mouth. She hears nothing and then, without warning, she's pulled out from under the bed, screaming. The BABY is left under the bed as she continues to scream.



Act One
EXT. HOUSE - DAY

There is a "HOME FOR RENT" sign in the yard, mostly obscured by a "RENTED" sticker.



INT. GARAGE - DAY

The Impala is mostly covered by a tan tarp, but the trunk is clear. DEAN opens the trunk of the Impala and looks inside. He takes out his sawed-off shotgun, checks the rounds, and then puts it away. He closes the trunk, locks it, puts the keys in his toolbox, and lets the tarp settle back over the trunk of the Impala. He leaves the garage with a box labeled "KITCHEN."



INT. DEAN'S HOUSE - DAY

DEAN and LISA are unpacking boxes. BEN sits at a table, looking upset.

LISA
What's up?

BEN
Nothing.

LISA
At least wait until you've checked the place out before you hate it. Open mind, that's all I ask.

BEN
Yeah, all right.

BEN stands.

BEN (CONT'D)
I'll be back.

BEN walks towards his bike.

DEAN
Oh, hey. Where's the fire?

BEN
Just going to check out the block.

DEAN
And let your mom unpack the kitchen by herself? Come on.

LISA
We'll go for lunch later. Scope out the neighborhood. Right?

DEAN
Yeah, sounds like a plan. (to BEN) Come on, why don't you give me a hand?

DEAN and BEN leave the room together.



EXT. VICTIM'S HOUSE

Cop cars are on the street and policemen walk in and out of the front door of a house surround by crime scene tape. We hear indistinct radio chatter in the background. SAM is talking to a DETECTIVE. He holds a flyer for a missing child in his hand.

SAM
Where'd you find them?

DETECTIVE
We found the parents upstairs. Pretty brutal.

SAM
Break in?

DETECTIVE
No, alarm never went off.

SAM
Any leads on the baby?

DETECTIVE
None yet.

SAM
So what do you think? Think it's okay? Alive?

DETECTIVE
I did yesterday.

SAM
Thank you.

SAM walks up the path towards the house, ducking under the crime scene tape that blocks it off.



INT. DEAN'S HOUSE - DAY

The doorbell rings. DEAN opens the front door and we see a PIZZA DELIVERY MAN.

PIZZA DELIVERY MAN
Hi.

DEAN
Hey.

PIZZA DELIVERY MAN
One cheese, one everything?

DEAN
Yeah. Thank you.

DEAN takes the pizzas and pays the PIZZA DELIVERY MAN.

DEAN
There you go. Keep the change.

PIZZA DELIVERY MAN
Thanks.

DEAN
Thanks.

DEAN turns and sees LISA and BEN standing behind him.

DEAN
What?

LISA
I thought we were going out?

DEAN
Oh yeah, I forgot. I'm sorry.

LISA
Sure. I'll look for plates.

LISA leaves the room.



EXT. VICTIM'S HOUSE - DAY

SAM leaves the house. He is talking to SAMUEL on his cell phone.

SAM
Hey. So, I've been all over this. No sulfur. No EMF. I'm starting to think maybe it's not our kind of thing.

SAMUEL
Four couples slaughtered in one part of the state within days of each other. That's four babies taken from locked houses. Damn it! Explain to me how any version of that is natural.

SAM
No, no, I agree. It's awful. I'm just saying this one might be on the police.

SAMUEL
Okay, so either we've got monsters grabbing babies to make baby stew, or we've got a bunch of psychotic yokels grabbing babies to make baby stew. Either way, it's baby stew, which is bad.

SAM sighs.

SAMUEL
Am I boring you? You got someplace you need to be?

SAM
No, no, no, I get it.

SAMUEL
Good. You know, sometimes I wonder about you, Sam.

SAM
Sometimes I wonder about me, too.

SAMUEL
Well, I will go back over everything. See if there's anything we missed.

SAM sees a sign for "Harper Caine Security" in the front yard of the house.

SAM
Hey, the detective said the alarm in the house never went off. You mind taking a quick look - see if anyone else had a system from Harper Caine Security?

SAMUEL
Yeah, sure. Any chance I get to hop on a computer.



INT. DEAN'S GARAGE - DAY

DEAN enters the garage. The trunk of the Impala is open and BEN is holding DEAN's sawed-off shotgun.

DEAN
What the hell? Hey, hey, give me that.

DEAN takes the gun from BEN, puts it back in the trunk, and closes the trunk.

DEAN
What do you think you're doing?

BEN
I just wanted to see it.

DEAN
Listen to me. Don't ever open this trunk. Do you understand me?

BEN
Okay, sorry. But I don't get it. You had your own rifle when you were my age.

DEAN
Ben, mark my words. You will never, ever shoot a gun, ever.

BEN
I know what's going on. You think something might be coming for us.

DEAN
There's nothing coming for us.

BEN
I could do what you do. You could teach me how to shoot--

DEAN
Shut up about the freaking gun, okay!

BEN
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

BEN leaves the garage and DEAN covers the trunk with the tarp again.



EXT. PARK - DAY

SAM is sitting on a park bench and reading a file. His cell phone rings and he answers it.

SAMUEL
You were right. Every family that got hit: Harper Caine Security. So I pulled the client records.

SAM
Right, to see if there's any other families who fit the profile.

SAMUEL
There is another happy couple walking and talking, 6 month old baby, like all the others.

SAM
What's the address?



INT. DEAN'S GARAGE - DAY

DEAN
Hey.

LISA
What happened? Ben's been locked in his room for hours. Says you yelled at him. What did he do?

DEAN
Nothing.

LISA
What did you do?

DEAN
He got into my tools. I shouldn't have got mad.

LISA
You want to talk about this?

DEAN
About?

LISA
Yelling at Ben? Keeping us in the house?

DEAN
I'm trying to keep us safe, here.

LISA
I'm not arguing, okay. You're the expert. I'm just asking. You said that you and your brother killed whatever was after us. And then we moved just to be sure! So what is it, Dean? A monster? Or monsters in general?

DEAN
I don't know. Something might come.

LISA
What?

DEAN
I don't know, I can't predict what's going to come after me.

LISA
Well, I'm going to need some parameters. We have to live our lives here. I mean, at some point I have to work. Ben has school!

DEAN
But if something happens on my watch...

LISA
I know you're trying to protect us, but you're kind of scaring me a little, too.

LISA leaves the garage.



EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

SAM pulls up in his car. He gets out, opens his trunk, and gets a gun and a flashlight. He walks up to the dark house. We see a "Harper Caine Security" sign in the yard. SAM jimmies the lock on the front door and enters the house. He finds the husband and wife dead and bloody in the living room. He follows bloody footprints further into the house, gun and flashlight raised. He checks a closet, but it is empty. A MAN barrels into him, disarming him and knocking him to the ground. SAM kicks him in the nose and knocks him back, which allows him to pull his knife. He slashes the MAN's arm, and the wound hisses and burns. The MAN flees. SAM checks the rest of the house, eventually entering the laundry room when he hears a noise. He looks under the folding table, and we see his surprised face.



INT. DEAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

DEAN's cell phone rings. He answers it.

DEAN
Sam?

SAM is driving and talking on his cell phone.

SAM
I need your help. Now.

DEAN
What's wrong?

SAM
I'm working this job.

DEAN
Dude.

SAM
Look, I just need you with me on this, okay?

DEAN
I'm out. I'm staying out.

SAM
Make an exception.

DEAN
For what?

SAM
Look, I'm thirty minutes away and I will drive to your door if you don't meet me.

DEAN
And what's so nuts that you gotta threaten a damn drive by?

DEAN makes a surprised face.



EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

DEAN drives up to SAM's car in his truck. He gets out and walks towards SAM.

DEAN
Where is it?

SAM
Strapped down in the back seat.

DEAN looks in the back of Sam's car.

SAM
Welcome to the party, Guttenberg.

We see a BABY in the back seat.



Act Two
INT. DEAN'S HOUSE - DAY

DEAN
Okay, show me.

LISA
I've got it. We've been over this.

DEAN
Humor me.

LISA
Load clip. Pull slide. Safety off. Safety on.

DEAN
And salt the windows and the doors.

LISA
Of course.

DEAN
Maybe I shouldn't go.

LISA
It's okay. You want to go, so go.

DEAN
You know what, Sam can handle this.

LISA
Dean, no offense, but if you don't walk out that door, I'm going to shoot you.

DEAN grabs his duffel bag and zips it closed before throwing the strap over his shoulder.

DEAN
I bet you're missing your ex right about now. The uh, the boring one?

LISA
God, shut up. Just be careful, okay?

DEAN kisses LISA and goes to walk out the door

DEAN
Bye.

LISA
Bye.



EXT. ROAD - DAY

DEAN drives up to SAM's car in his truck, gets out, and pulls his duffel bag out of the truck bed.

DEAN
Alright, so what do we know about this thing?

SAM
Well, uh, it was fast and it freaked when I cut it with silver.

DEAN
Alright, so that narrows it down to...

SAM
A ghoul? A zombie, a shifter, or about a dozen other things.

DEAN
I don't recall seeing babynapping in the profiles.

SAM
Yeah, exactly.

SAM and DEAN get in the car.



INT. SAM'S CAR - DAY

DEAN looks back at the BABY.

DEAN
Well feel free to speak up if you know anything.

SAM starts the car and it makes a continual dinging sound.

SAM
Seatbelt.

DEAN
What am I, in third grade? A car should drive, not be a little bitch.

The BABY cries out and DEAN and SAM look back at it. The BABY farts.

DEAN
Yeah, don't take it personal.

DEAN looks at SAM.

DEAN
Well, we need to get some supplies.

SAM
I've got an arsenal in the trunk.

DEAN
Not that kind.



INT. STORE - DAY

DEAN walks next to SAM, who pushes a grocery cart down a store aisle. The BABY is in a baby seat in the front of the cart.

DEAN
Alright, I'm pretty sure that there's some kind of paste or jelly you're supposed to put on their butt.

SAM grabs a box off the shelf.

SAM
Like uh... like that?

DEAN
Yeah, grab that.

DEAN grabs a box of diapers and puts it in the cart.

SAM
So how do you know all this?

DEAN
Lisa has a baby niece, so I've been on a few milk runs.

SAM
Huh.

DEAN
Shut it.

SAM
I just said "huh."

DEAN
I just said "shut it."

The BABY starts fussing.

DEAN
Alright, we gotta get moving. We've got the waterworks in like, T-minus ten.

SAM
Yeah, okay.

DEAN
Go.



INT. STORE - CHECKOUT LINE - DAY

The BABY is crying loudly. CUSTOMERS are disapproving. SAM loads groceries on the counter for checkout while DEAN tries to calm the BABY.

DEAN
Shh... shh... Come on, hang in there buddy. Hang in there, man.

SAM
Dean, make it stop.

DEAN
How?

SAM
Everyone's staring at us like we're child abusers! Feed it!

DEAN
We fed it!

SAM
Then what?

DEAN
I don't know. You think I speak baby? Maybe he needs a diaper change.

SAM
Oh God, I hope not.

DEAN takes the BABY out of its baby seat and holds it awkwardly. He tries to check if its diaper needs changing. The BABY continues to cry and DEAN mimics it. A WOMAN approaches them.

WOMAN
Aw... what's the matter? What's his name?

DEAN
Bobby.

SAM
John.

DEAN
Bobby John.

WOMAN
Hi, Bobby John. Aren't you handsome? May, I?

DEAN
Oh, oh uh...

The WOMAN takes BOBBY JOHN in her arms and it settles down.

WOMAN
I see now, Bobby John's a little wet. No offense, you two look exhausted. I don't mind. Lord knows I've changed a million diapers.

DEAN sees the WOMAN's eyes flare in a security camera feed behind him. She is a SHAPESHIFTER.

DEAN
That's a really nice offer, thank you, but um... I think we've got it.

SHAPESHIFTER
Oh, it's nothing. Happy to help.

DEAN
Give me the baby before I stab you in your neck.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN points behind him and SAM sees from the camera feed that she is a SHAPESHIFTER.

The SHAPESHIFTER runs away with BOBBY JOHN. SAM and DEAN give chase. DEAN tries to grab her, but the flesh of her arm sheds off in his hand. SAM runs into her and takes BOBBY JOHN before running outside. DEAN then tackles the SHAPESHIFTER to the ground and pulls out his knife.

SHAPESHIFTER
Help me!

A STORE MANAGER approaches.

STORE MANAGER
Hey!

SHAPESHIFTER
He's hurting me!

STORE MANAGER
Get off of her!

The STORE MANAGER pulls DEAN off of the SHAPESHIFTER.

DEAN
Okay, alright. Alright.

DEAN puts away the knife, then runs out of the store.



EXT. STORE - DAY

DEAN gets into SAM's car.

DEAN
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

SAM drives away quickly. The SHAPESHIFTER runs outside and watches them leave. She sees the license plate number on SAM's car.



INT. SAM'S CAR - DAY

DEAN is trying to strap BOBBY JOHN in his car seat while SAM drives.

DEAN
The hell does a shifter want with a baby, anyway?

SAM
You tell me.

DEAN
And how the hell did it find us?

DEAN struggles with the baby seat.

DEAN (CONT'D)
Who designed this thing? NASA?

SAM
You know, it could have been following me this whole time. Since the baby's house.

DEAN
Alright, you know, we got to get off the road. Get Bobby John here someplace safe. Figure this thing out. Okay, alright, shh, shh. Easy, kid.



EXT. POLICE CAR - DAY

A POLICE OFFICER sits in his patrol car. His driver side door is open and he is on his radio.

DISPATCH
Charlie 86, go ahead.

POLICE OFFICER
I need a 10-28 on Illinois plates I as in India, 4 Zulu Oscar 8 9 2.

DISPATCH
Copy, 86. Stand by.

The camera pans to the left and we see the real POLICE OFFICER dead in the passenger seat of the patrol car. The man talking on the radio was the SHAPESHIFTER. The passenger side door is open and there is a pile of shed skin on the ground next to it.



INT. MOTEL - DAY

DEAN is changing BOBBY JOHN'S diaper on a motel bed.

DEAN
Okay, alright, you know what? I'll pay you money if you sit still.

SAM laughs.

DEAN (CONT'D)
This is like defusing an IED, with poop! Okay, alright, alright, alright, you are golden, Bobby John. Time to hit the hay.

DEAN picks up Bobby John and hums "Smoke on the Water" as he carries him over to a crib.

SAM
Dean, you're just going to make it cranky again.

DEAN
Shh, it's working. Okay, if I put you down, you gonna be a man about it?

DEAN puts BOBBY JOHN down in the crib. BOBBY JOHN goes to sleep.

SAM
Huh.

DEAN
What?

SAM
You're just, uh, actually, not awful at that.

DEAN
Dude, I'm barely keeping that thing alive.

SAM
No, no, no, seriously. You've got a whole Dr. Huxtable vibe coming off of you. You're like... father material.

DEAN
Yeah, well I kind of had to be lately, you know. Sink or swim, right?

SAM
You mean Ben.

DEAN
Yeah, I mean Ben. I mean, I know he's not my kid, but I don't know, I'm starting to feel like yeah, he is. Then I think about the way we grew up, I don't know, I kind of feel like I have a chance to do something different with Ben, you know?

SAM
You sure about that?

DEAN
What do you mean?

SAM
Look, you clearly care about the kid.

DEAN
But?

SAM
But moving them around? Keeping them on lockdown? I mean, you do have them on lockdown, right? How is any of that different from how we were raised?

DEAN
So you're saying... I'm not shoving anybody into this life, okay? This is temporary.

SAM
Dad always said it was temporary, Dean. He said it for 22 years. Look, I get it. You want to watch out for them. That's great. I'm just asking, how do you do that and not turn into Dad?

DEAN is quiet. SAM looks at the papers on the table in front of him.

SAM
Crap. I can't believe I missed this.

DEAN
What?

SAM
This house on Elm. The mother was killed, baby was grabbed, but daddy wasn't living in the house at the time so he's still alive. What do you say we go and have a chat?

DEAN
I say let's.

DEAN and SAM both look at BOBBY JOHN, who is still lying in his crib.

DEAN
You go.

SAM
You sure?

DEAN
Unless you've got a badge for Bobby John, yeah, I'm sure.

SAM leaves the room and BOBBY JOHN starts to cry. DEAN puts a finger in his drink and reaches down into BOBBY JOHN's crib. BOBBY JOHN quiets.

DEAN
It's good, isn't it?



EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY

SAM is questioning a MAN in coveralls.

MAN
I just, I still can't believe it. I mean, it's one thing to die like that. The poor baby, just into thin air. No thanks to you guys.

SAM
Well, that's why I'm here. You had filed for divorce? It's important, I'm sorry.

MAN
She, uh. She cheated on me, and, well, I caught her.

SAM
And did you know the other man?

MAN
No, I mean, I didn't "catch her" catch her, but she lied to me.

SAM
Okay.

MAN
We hadn't, you know, in a while, and then she's pregnant.

SAM
And what did she say?

MAN
She said it was mine. I know. And I said that's impossible and what is she talking about. And she says don't you remember when you went out of town and then you came back early?

SAM
But you didn't.

MAN
No. I was at a damn softball tournament. Whoever he was, he's the father.



INT. MOTEL - DAY

BOBBY JOHN is lying in his crib. DEAN is on the motel bed, enjoying the "Magic Fingers" vibrations. He hears a sound and BOBBY JOHN starts crying. Blood and skin are on the wall above the crib. As DEAN gets up off the bed, his cell phone rings and he answers it.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
I talked to the father. He checks out. But the baby...

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
I think the shapeshifter is his dad.

DEAN picks up BOBBY JOHN and holds him at arm's length. BOBBY JOHN is now black. He looks like the baby that was on the nearby box of diapers.

DEAN
You think?



Act Three
INT. MOTEL - DAY

DEAN is trying to calm down BOBBY JOHN, who is crying loudly. There is a knock on the door.

MANAGER
Manager! Everything okay in there?

DEAN
Yeah, no, we're fine. Thank you. Good night.

MANAGER
There's been complaints. Mind opening the door, sir?

DEAN
It's not a good time. Just got out of the shower.

The doorknob rattles. DEAN puts BOBBY JOHN in the crib and stands to the side of the door. The door unlocks and the SHAPESHIFTER, still disguised as a police officer, enters the room. DEAN attacks him and they grapple. DEAN is pushed back.

SHAPESHIFTER
Get out of the way.

DEAN
Yeah, that's not going to happen.

SHAPESHIFTER
That child should be with his father.

DEAN
Wow, I gotta be honest. I'm not really seeing the family resemblance.

SHAPESHIFTER
I'm not just talking about me. I'm talking about our father.

The SHAPESHIFTER moves to attack, and DEAN punches him and slashes him across the face with a silver knife. They continue to fight and DEAN is thrown back on the ground. SAM enters the motel room and shoots the SHAPESHIFTER through the heart, killing him.

DEAN
Well, there goes our deposit.



INT. SAM'S CAR

SAM is driving. DEAN sits next to him in the passenger seat. BOBBY JOHN is sleeping in the back seat.

SAM
You know, it's pretty smart, actually. I mean, shifter poses as a guard for the security company to get near the house. Then it scopes out the fam.

DEAN
Yeah, and then daddy takes off, and shifter becomes daddy. A few glasses of wine, shakes momma's trees, comes back in nine months to collect its prize.

SAM
I didn't even know they had babies. I thought they were just freaks of nature, like X-Men style.

DEAN
You learn something new every day, huh?

SAM
I've never seen a baby monster before.

DEAN
Of course it's not really a monster. I mean, it's still just a baby. It's not its fault its dad's a shifter.

SAM
Right, but it's a shifter, too.

DEAN
Still doesn't change the fact that we've got to look after this thing. I mean, what the hell are we going to do with it? We can't actually drop it off at an orphanage. They might get upset when it turns Asian.

SAM
Samuel.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Samuel. He'll know what to do.

DEAN
You want to bring it to a bunch of hunters?

SAM
Not just hunters, Dean. They're our family.

DEAN
We don't know them.

SAM
I do. Not every hunter is a head case. I mean, Samuel is actually a lot like you.

DEAN
I'm a freaking head case.

SAM
Well, pitch a better idea then.

DEAN stays silent.

SAM (CONT'D)
Great! Samuel, it is.



EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

SAM, DEAN, and BOBBY JOHN drive through a guarded gate into the Campbells' compound.



INT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

DEAN is holding BOBBY JOHN. CHRISTIAN walks past. GWEN approaches DEAN and strokes BOBBY JOHN.

GWEN
Well aren't you just the best disguise a monster ever wore? I'm kidding, Dean. Relax.

MARK approaches DEAN.

DEAN
What, you got something to say? No? Alright, well, you stand there and think at me.

SAM and SAMUEL enter the room.

SAM
What's our next move?

SAMUEL
I got a couple of ideas. Dean, let me see the little guy.

DEAN
That's alright, I got him.

SAMUEL
What do you think I'm going to do?

DEAN
You really don't want me to answer that question.

CHRISTIAN
Well I'm curious. Who exactly do you think we are?

DEAN
Hunters.

CHRISTIAN
Funny, here I've been thinking we're family.

SAM
Hey, let's not get worked up.

CHRISTIAN
Yeah, yeah, let's not.

SAM
Here, Dean, it's fine. Let me take him. It's okay.

SAM takes BOBBY JOHN and then passes him to SAMUEL.

SAMUEL
Hey there. You're a big fella, aren't ya? Yeah. I haven't held one of these in a long time. Your mom was the tiniest. She was as bald as a cue ball.

DEAN
Alright, so what the hell are we going to do with him?

SAMUEL
Raise him.

DEAN
Raise him?

SAMUEL
What, you've got another suggestion?

DEAN
But...

SAMUEL
It's dangerous out there for him, Dean.

DEAN
And what about in here? What are we gonna - study him? Poke at him?

CHRISTIAN
Your mind goes straight to torture, Dean. Don't assume that for everyone.

DEAN
What exactly are you trying to say?

CHRISTIAN
Sorry, I heard about what you majored in down in the Pit.

DEAN
The hell is your problem, man?

CHRISTIAN
You're starting to become a pain in my ass.

SAM
Christian, take it easy, man. He's my brother.

SAMUEL
We all done bristling up here, or what? Nobody's doing anything to him, Dean. When he's old enough, we throw it to him. He wants to volunteer to help out, that's fine.

MARK
Could be great.

DEAN
How?

MARK
Think of the kind of hunter he'll grow up to be.

DEAN
You all are joking, right? I mean, come on! You can't "Angelina Jolie" a shapeshifter. Give me the baby.

SAMUEL
Why can't you give me an inch of trust, Dean?

DEAN
Maybe because you two are suddenly back from the dead, and I seem to be the only one who wants to know how the hell that happened!

SAM
You're not the only one who wants to know.

DEAN
There's just a little too much mystery with this family for me to get comfy.

SAMUEL
Then don't! But don't put it on us. All we're trying to do is invite you in. Christian?

CHRISTIAN
Yeah?

SAMUEL
You and Arlene, still no luck on the baby front?

CHRISTIAN
Not yeah, no.

SAMUEL
But you want one?

CHRISTIAN
Yeah, we do.

DEAN
Wait, hold on.

SAMUEL
It's okay, Dean. It's alright.

SAMUEL hands BOBBY JOHN to CHRISTIAN.

SAMUEL
Congrats. It's a boy, sometimes.

CHRISTIAN
(Laughs) The crap I do for this family.

DEAN
You're kidding me, right?

CHRISTIAN
Go to hell, Dean.

DEAN
Well, you have no business raising anything.

SAM
Why, Dean? Because he's a hunter?

Dogs are barking outside.

SAMUEL
Check the back door.

CHRISTIAN hands BOBBY JOHN to SAMUEL, and SAMUEL passes him to DEAN.

SAMUEL (CONT'D)
Downstairs, panic room. He'll be safe there. Go. Forget it, go! Now!

DEAN and SAM leave for the panic room with BOBBY JOHN. GWEN, CHRISTIAN, MARK, AND SAMUEL get weapons ready and aim them at the door just as it is kicked in by SHAPESHIFTER 2, disguised as Samuel. SHAPESHIFTER 2 walks inside.

SHAPESHIFTER 2
You have something of ours.



Act Four
INT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

SHAPESHIFTER 2
I know he's here. I can feel him.

GWEN shoots SHAPESHIFTER 2 in the back twice with a shotgun, but it has no effect. SHAPESHIFTER 2 approaches GWEN and MARK jumps between them, stabbing SHAPESHIFTER 2 in the heart. It also has no effect. SAMUEL shoots SHAPESHIFTER 2 in the back with a tranquilizer.

MARK
Run!

SHAPESHIFTER 2 breaks MARK's neck, killing him.

CHRISTIAN
Mark!

SHAPESHIFTER 2 grabs GWEN by the neck. SAMUEL and CHRISTIAN shoot more tranquilizers into SHAPESHIFTER 2. SHAPESHIFTER 2 pulls the knife out of his heart, but the tranquilizers take effect and he weakens, letting GWEN go.

SAMUEL
Easy tiger. (to Christian) Get the silver nets. We're gonna box him up.

SHAPESHIFTER 2 stands straight and the tranquilizers shoot out of his back.



INT. COMPOUND - PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM pace. DEAN holds BOBBY JOHN.

DEAN
Come on, Bobby John. You have got to keep quiet.

They hear gunfire upstairs.

DEAN (CONT'D)
It does not sound good up there.

SAM
Alright, I'm going to go up. Stay with the baby.

SAM goes to the door and sees SHAPESHIFTER 2, disguised as SAM, in the window. SAM pulls out his knife, and SHAPESHIFTER 2 tears the panic room door off its hinges. SHAPESHIFTER 2 quickly overpowers SAM and approaches DEAN and BOBBY JOHN. As it nears, it shifts into DEAN without shedding its skin.

DEAN
What the...

SHAPESHIFTER 2
Give me the baby.

DEAN
No way in hell.

SHAPESHIFTER 2 grabs DEAN by the neck and raises him up the wall. SHAPESHIFTER 2 takes BOBBY JOHN and chokes DEAN before letting him fall to the floor. SHAPESHIFTER 2 walks out of the panic room with BOBBY JOHN still disguised as DEAN.



INT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

SAM and SAMUEL talk while CHRISTIAN and GWEN clean up after the attack. DEAN approaches SAM and SAMUEL.

SAMUEL
Well, I'm pretty sure it's not a myth now.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
What the hell was that thing?

SAMUEL
We think it may have been an Alpha.

DEAN
An alpha, like?

SAMUEL
Like all monsters come from somewhere, right?

DEAN
And you think that this one was -

SAMUEL
The king shapeshifter. First one who spawned all the others - there's tons of lore about it.

DEAN
The first one?

SAM
That's why it was so strong, and why nothing we had stopped it.

SAMUEL
And he said that he could find the baby anywhere. That he could feel it, like there's a connection. That's in the lore, too.

DEAN
What the hell does it want with babies, anyway?

SAMUEL
A softball team? I got no clue.

DEAN
Great, well then how do we kill it?

SAMUEL
I don't know if we can.



EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM walk out of the compound together.

DEAN
You know, it's funny.

SAM
What's that?

DEAN
You know, just before you ganked that shifter in the motel, he mentioned a father, which makes sense now because he meant the Alpha.

SAM
Huh. Yeah, I guess so.

DEAN
Did you hear him say that?

SAM
Uh, I don't know. Kind of a hot moment, you know? Why?

DEAN
Well, because if you heard him, then you knew the Alpha was out there.

SAM
Okay.

DEAN
And if you knew the Alpha was out there then you knew he might come after the baby. In which case you were using the baby as bait. So was that the plan? To use the baby as bait?

SAM
Of course not. Dean, I just thought that Samuel's was the safest place. That's all.

DEAN
Right, of course.

SAM gets in the car. DEAN follows.



Act Five
INT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

SAMUEL is sitting in the kitchen area, talking on the phone.

SAMUEL
No, I didn't catch it. It killed three of my people. I shot it full of elephant tranquilizer, and it chuckled! To be honest, I'm not sure I want to find it. But yeah, we will find a way to catch it. (pause) Yeah, sure, I'll bring it right to you, gift wrapped.



INT. DEAN'S HOUSE

LISA dries dishes in the kitchen. DEAN enters.

LISA
Hey.

DEAN
Hey, where's Ben?

LISA
Bike ride. What?

DEAN
I don't know what to do here, Lis. I mean, if I knew for sure what the safest thing was, then I'd do it. Stay here and look after you guys or get as far away as I possibly can, but I don't know. And I get what I've been doing lately, you know, what with the yelling and the acting like a prison guard. It's just, that's not me. You tell yourself you're not gonna be something, you know? But my dad was exactly like this. All the time. It's scaring the hell out of me.

LISA
Dean, can I be honest? Maybe we're safer with you here, maybe gone. I don't know. The one thing that I do know is that you're not a construction worker. You're a hunter. And now you know your brother's out there, things are different. You don't want to be here, Dean.

DEAN
Yes, I do.

LISA
Okay. Okay, but you also want to be there. I get it. You're white-knuckling it living like this. Like what you are is some bad, awful thing. But you're not. But I'm not going to have this discussion every time you leave. And this is just going to keep happening, so I need you to go.

DEAN
I can't just lose you and Ben.

LISA
That's not what I'm saying.

DEAN
You're saying hit the road.

LISA
Dean, if there's some rule that says this all has to be either/or, how about we break it? Me and Ben will be here, and you come when you can. Just come in one piece, okay?

DEAN
You really think we can pull something like that off?

LISA
It's worth a shot, right?



INT. DEAN'S GARAGE

"Smoke on the Water" plays. DEAN pulls the tarp off the Impala and smiles.
