TEASER
TITLE CARD:
THE ROAD SO FAR

AC/DC's “Shook Me All Night Long” plays over general badassery of SAM and DEAN and the basic plot that DEAN went to Hell because SAM couldn't stop it.

TITLE CARD:
NOW

We see quick flashes of DEAN being tormented, his eyes flicking back and forth, his face covered in blood.

Cut to DEAN in a dark place; he breathes heavily, flicks his lighter on. He is inside a wooden coffin.

DEAN
(extremely hoarse)
Help! Help! Help!

DEAN pounds on the wood above his head; dirt rains down on his face. He continues to pound.

EXT. FIELD – DAY

In the middle of a grassy field, a simple wooden cross is planted. As we pan back, a HAND bursts out of the dirt, followed by another. It is DEAN, and he crawls his way out of the ground, groaning and gasping. He lies on his back, panting. He stands, looks around in the glaring sunlight. Around his crude headstone is a perfect circle of dead trees, laying on the ground as if an unearthly powerful blast had felled them.

TITLE CARD:
SUPERNATURAL


ACT ONE
EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD – DAY

Through hazy heat, DEAN walks down an empty road and approaches an abandoned gas station. He pounds on the door.

DEAN
(hoarse) Hello?

INT. GAS STATION – DAY

DEAN rolls up his outer shirt over his right hand, breaks the glass on the door. Inside, he grabs a water bottle from a fridge and gulps at it, gasping. He finds a newspaper and sees the date, which reads:

Thursday, September 18th

DEAN
September.

INT – GAS STATION BATHROOM - DAY

DEAN washes his face in a dingy sink, then looks up and stares at his reflection. He wears a tight black t-shirt. Frowning, he stands, pulls the shirt up to expose his chest.

FLASHBACK
DEAN's chest is ripped apart by the Hellhounds (3.16)

PRESENT
DEAN stares at his unblemished, unscarred chest in the dingy gas station mirror. He turns his left shoulder to the mirror and pulls up the sleeve to reveal a large, raw HANDPRINT BRAND.

INT – GAS STATION MART – DAY

DEAN pulls snacks and energy bars from the shelves, along with several bottles of water, and stashes them in a plastic bag. Stopping in front of a magazine stand, he grins slowly. On the stand is an Adult Magazine - “Busty Asian Beauties”. He picks it up, smirks, flips through it, and stuffs it in the bag too.

He goes to the counter, sets down the bag, and hits a single button on the register, snapping his fingers in satisfaction when it pops open. As he's looting the cash, the TV to his left flicks on, showing only static. He shuts it off; only to have a radio to his right turn on to white noise. Not wasting a moment, he goes to another shelf and grabs a carton of salt, opens it, and begins to pour it along the windowsill.

A high-pitched single tone begins, and DEAN clutches his left ear in pain as he continues to pour salt with his right hand. As it continues, he drops the salt and crouches to the floor, groaning in agony. The window above his head shatters as the sound continues, and he drops to the floor. He leaps to his feet to try to escape, and more glass on the ceiling and walls shatters. He looks around cautiously.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH – DAY

DEAN dials a number, and hears only an alert tone.

RECORDED VOICE
We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected.

DEAN hangs up the pay phone and inserts another coin, dials another number. It rings once, then is picked up.

BOBBY (V.O.)
Yeah?

DEAN
Bobby?

BOBBY (V.O.)
Yeah?

DEAN
It's me.

BOBBY (V.O.)
Who's “me”?

DEAN
Dean.

A dial tone sounds. DEAN hangs up the receiver and dials again.

BOBBY (V.O.)
Who is this?

DEAN
Bobby, listen to me.

BOBBY (V.O.)
This ain't funny. Call again, I'll kill ya.

The dial tone again. DEAN hangs up the phone, turns. He sees an old, beat-up white car parked outside. His eyes light up; he hotwires the car and pulls away from the gas station.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – DAY

To a pounding on the door, BOBBY'S hand appears to open it. On the doorstep is DEAN, looking winded and apprehensive. He smiles cautiously. BOBBY looks at him suspiciously.

DEAN
Surprise.

BOBBY
I, I don't...

DEAN
Yeah, me neither. (He enters.) But here I am.

Behind his back, BOBBY takes a silver knife. As DEAN approaches, BOBBY lunges forward and slashes at him. DEAN grabs his arm and twists it around; BOBBY breaks the grip and backhands him in the face.

DEAN
Bobby! It's me!

BOBBY
My ass!

DEAN
(shoves a chair between himself and BOBBY, holds his hands out) Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! Your name is Robert Steven Singer. You became a hunter after your wife got possessed, and... you're about the closest thing I have to a father. Bobby. It's me.

BOBBY lowers the knife, steps forward slowly. He places a hand gently on DEAN'S shoulder. Suddenly he slashes again, but DEAN quickly subdues and disarms him.

DEAN
I am not a shapeshifter!

BOBBY
Then you're a Revenant!

DEAN shoves BOBBY away, having taken the KNIFE. He holds it out in front of him.

DEAN
Alright. If I was either, could I do this – with a silver knife?

DEAN rolls up his left sleeve, and, grimacing, slices his arm above the elbow with the knife. A line of blood appears.

BOBBY
(starting to believe it) Dean?

DEAN
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

BOBBY breaks, grabbing DEAN in for a tight hug. DEAN returns the hug with enthusiasm, relief on his face. They pull apart.

BOBBY
It's... It's good to see you, boy.

DEAN
Yeah, you too.

BOBBY
But... how did you bust out?

DEAN
I don't know. I just, uh, I just woke up in a pine box...

Suddenly, BOBBY splashes water in DEAN'S face. DEAN pauses, spits.

DEAN
I'm not a demon either, you know.

BOBBY
Sorry. Can't be too careful.

They go further into the house, DEAN wiping his face with a towel.

BOBBY
But... that don't make a lick of sense.

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, you're preachin' to the choir.

BOBBY
Dean. Your chest was ribbons, your insides were slop. And you've been buried four months. Even if you could slip out of hell and back into your meat suit -

DEAN
I know, I should look like a Thriller video reject.

BOBBY
What do you remember?

DEAN
Not much. I remember I was a Hellhound's chew toy, and then... lights out. Then I come to six feet under, that was it. (BOBBY sits.) Sam's number's not working. He's, uh... he's not...

BOBBY
Oh, he's alive. As far as I know.

DEAN
Good.... Wait, what do you mean, as far as you know?

BOBBY
I haven't talked to him for months.

DEAN
You're kidding, you just let him go off by himself?

BOBBY
He was dead set on it.

DEAN
Bobby, you should've been looking after him.

BOBBY
I tried. These last months haven't been exactly easy, you know. For him or me. We had to bury you.

DEAN
Why did you bury me, anyway?

BOBBY
I wanted you salted and burned. Usual drill. But... Sam wouldn't have it.

DEAN
Well, I'm glad he won that one.

BOBBY
He said you'd need a body when he got you back home somehow. That's about all he said.

DEAN
(suspicious) What do you mean?

BOBBY
He was quiet. Real quiet. And then he just took off. Wouldn't return my calls. I tried to find him, but he didn't want to be found.

DEAN
Oh, damnit, Sammy.

BOBBY
What?

DEAN
Oh, he got me home okay. But whatever he did, it is bad mojo.

BOBBY
What makes you so sure?

DEAN
You should have seen the grave site. It was like a nuke went off. And then there was this... this force, this presence, I don't know, but it, it blew past me at a fill-up joint. And then this. (He strips his jacket, pulls up his sleeve to reveal the brand.)

BOBBY
(standing) What in the hell?

DEAN
It was like a demon just yanked me out. Or rode me out.

BOBBY
But why?

DEAN
To hold up their end of the bargain.

BOBBY
You think Sam made a deal.

DEAN
It's what I would have done.

INT BOBBY'S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN
(into the phone) Yeah, hi, I have a cell phone account with you guys, and uh, I lost my phone. I was wondering if you could turn the GPS on for me. (beat) Yeah. Name's Wedge Antilles. (beat) Social is 2-4-7-4. (beat) Thank you.

DEAN hangs up the phone and crosses to a laptop on the table.

BOBBY
How'd you know he'd use that name?

DEAN
You kiddin' me? What don't I know about that kid?

The laptop is open to a web browser; DEAN types in the address for ARC MOBILE.

DEAN
(picking up one of the many empty liquor bottles scattered around) Hey, Bobby? What's the deal with the liquor store? What, are your parents out of town or something?

BOBBY
Like I said. Last few months ain't been all that easy.

DEAN
(holds his gaze for a moment) Right.

The laptop beeps; the display shows a city map with a blue arrow pointing to a star. The locator reads:

Phone Location:
263 Adams Road
Pontiac, Illinois.

DEAN
Sam's in Pontiac, Illinois.

BOBBY
Right near where you were planted.

DEAN
Right where I popped up. Hell of a coincidence, don't you think?

EXT. ASTORIA MOTEL – NIGHT

DEAN and BOBBY walk down a dingy hallway and knock on a door with the number 207 inside a red heart. The door is opened by a HOT YOUNG WOMAN with dark hair, wearing only a tank top and underwear. She looks at them expectantly.

HOT YOUNG WOMAN
So where is it?

DEAN
(looks at BOBBY, confused) Where's what?

HOT YOUNG WOMAN
The pizza... that takes two guys to deliver?

DEAN
I think we got the wrong room.

SAM steps into the light. He is grim and focused, and wears a grey t-shirt and jeans.

SAM
Hey, is...

SAM stops dead when he sees DEAN. He swallows, shocked, his eyes flicking between DEAN and BOBBY.

DEAN
(quietly, with much feeling) Heya, Sammy.

SAM is silent. DEAN steps into the room, ignoring the H.Y.W., who steps aside to let him in. As DEAN gets close, SAM pulls a knife and lunges at DEAN. H.Y.W. screams; DEAN blocks SAM'S attack and BOBBY pulls SAM off, gripping him around the shoulders. SAM struggles.

SAM
(shouting) Who are you?!

DEAN
Like you didn't do this?!

SAM
Do what?!

BOBBY
It's him. It's him. I've been through this already, it's really him.

SAM
(stares at DEAN as the struggle slowly goes out of his body) What...

DEAN
(advancing cautiously, staring at SAM) I know. I look fantastic, huh?

BOBBY lets go of SAM, who looks on the verge of tears as he steps forward and pulls DEAN into a desperate hug. They embrace for several seconds, heavy with emotion, as BOBBY looks on with tears in his eyes. SAM pushes DEAN back to arm's length. H.Y.W. is looking on, looking confused.

HOT YOUNG WOMAN
So are you two like... together?

SAM
(like he's just remembered that she's there) What? No. No. He's my brother.

HOT YOUNG WOMAN
Uh... got it. I... I guess. Look, I should probably go.

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Sorry.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

SAM, now wearing a white button-down, opens the door to let the H.Y.W., now dressed in an adorable blue plaid shirt, out.

HOT YOUNG WOMAN
So, call me.

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, sure thing, Kathy.

HOT YOUNG WOMAN:(disappointed) Kristy.

SAM
Right.

She leaves, and SAM shuts the door.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

SAM comes back into the room and sits down. DEAN is standing above him, arms crossed. He and BOBBY are both looking at SAM suspiciously.

DEAN
So tell me, what'd it cost?

SAM
(smiling) The girl? I don't pay, Dean.

DEAN That's not funny, Sam. To bring me back. What'd it cost? Was it just your soul, or was it something worse?

SAM
You think I made a deal?

BOBBY
That's exactly what we think.

SAM
Well, I didn't.

DEAN
(intensely) Don't lie to me.

SAM
I'm not lying.

DEAN
(advancing) So what now, I'm off the hook and you're on, is that it? You're some demon's bitch-boy? I didn't want to be saved like this.

SAM
(standing, angrily) Look, Dean, I wish I had done it, all right?

DEAN
(grabs SAM by the front of his shirt) There's no other way that this could have gone down. Now tell the truth!

SAM
(breaking DEAN'S grip) I tried everything. That's the truth. I tried opening the Devil's Gate. Hell, I tried to bargain, Dean, but no demon would deal, all right? You were rotting in Hell for months. For months, and I couldn't stop it. So I'm sorry it wasn't me, all right? Dean, I'm sorry.

DEAN
(relenting) It's okay, Sammy. You don't have to apologize, I believe you.

BOBBY
Don't get me wrong, I'm gladdened that Sam's soul remains intact, but it does raise a sticky question.

DEAN
If he didn't pull me out, then what did?

END ACT ONE


ACT TWO
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN and BOBBY are seated the couch. SAM enters and passes out bottles of beer, then sits across from DEAN.

DEAN
So what were you doing around here if you weren't digging me out of my grave?

SAM
Well, once I figured out I couldn't save you, I started hunting down Lilith, trying to get some payback.

BOBBY
(accusing)
All by yourself. Who do you think you are, your old man?

DEAN sees something, frowns, and crosses towards it.

SAM
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry, Bobby. I should have called. I was pretty messed up.

DEAN picks up what he'd seen
a pink flowered bra. He holds it up.

DEAN
Oh yeah. I really feel your pain.

SAM
Anyways, uh, I was checking these demons out of Tennessee, and out of nowhere they took a hard left, booked up here.

DEAN
When?

SAM
Yesterday morning.

DEAN
When I busted out.

BOBBY
You think these demons are here 'cause of you?

SAM
But why?

DEAN
Well, I don't know – some badass demon drags me out and now this? It's gotta be connected somehow.

BOBBY
How you feelin', anyway?

DEAN
I'm a little hungry.

BOBBY
No, I mean, do you feel like yourself? Anything strange, or different?

DEAN
Or demonic? Bobby, how many times do I have to prove I'm me?

BOBBY
Yeah. Well, listen. No demon's letting you loose out of the goodness of their hearts. They've gotta have something nasty planned.

DEAN
Well, I feel fine.

SAM
Okay, look, we don't know what they're planning. We got a pile of questions and no shovel. We need help.

BOBBY
I know a psychic. A few hours from here. Something this big, maybe she's heard the other side talking.

DEAN
Hell yeah, it's worth a shot.

BOBBY
I'll be right back

BOBBY exits.

DEAN stands as if to leave.

SAM
Hey, wait. (stands) You probably want this back.

SAM reaches into his collar and pulls out a cord. It is DEAN'S AMULET. He places it in DEAN'S hand. DEAN looks at it, touched.

DEAN
Thanks.

SAM
Yeah, don't mention it.
(DEAN puts the AMULET on)
Hey Dean, what was it like?

DEAN
What, Hell? I don't know, I, I must have blacked it out. I don't remember a damn thing.

SAM
(nodding)
Well, thank God for that.

DEAN
Yeah.

INT. MOTEL BATHROOM – NIGHT

DEAN flicks on the light and stares at himself in the mirror. He runs a hand over his chin and leans forward on the sink.

FLASHBACK
Closeup of DEAN'S bloody, terrified face, with screams and eerie sounds.

PRESENT
DEAN pulls back from the mirror, blinking in confusion.

EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT – NIGHT

BOBBY leads the boys down a set of steps.

BOBBY
She's about four hours down the Interstate. Try to keep up.

BOBBY gets in his car.

SAM
I assume you'll want to drive.

SAM pulls the keys out of his right pocket and tosses them at DEAN, who catches them easily.

DEAN
(chuckling)
Oh, I almost forgot!
(he approaches the IMPALA and runs a hand along it lovingly.)
Hey, sweetheart, did you miss me?

DEAN gets in the driver's side, settles in. He sees an iPod plugged into the stereo, pauses, and gives it a dirty look. SAM gets into the passenger's seat, smiling. DEAN glares at him.

DEAN
What the hell is that?

SAM
That's an iPod jack.

DEAN
You were supposed to take care of her, not douche her up.

SAM
Dean, I thought it was my car.

DEAN sneers, sighs, and turns the key in the ignition. "Vision" by Jason Manns begins to play. DEAN rolls his eyes and glares at SAM again, looking pained.

DEAN
Really?

SAM shrugs innocently. DEAN rips the iPod out of the jack and tosses it in the back seat.

EXT. TWO-LANE BLACKTOP – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are back in their familiar places, having a heart-to-heart in the IMPALA on a dark road.

DEAN
There's still one thing that's bothering me.

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
Yeah, the night that I bit it. Or... got bit.
(he chuckles at his own wit)
How'd you make it out? I thought Lilith was going to kill you.

SAM
Well, she tried. She couldn't.

DEAN
What do you mean, she couldn't?

SAM
She fired this, like, burning light at me, and... didn't leave a scratch. Like I was immune or something.

DEAN
Immune?

SAM
Yeah. I don't know who was more surprised, her or me. She left pretty fast after that.

DEAN
Huh. What about Ruby, where is she?

SAM
Dead. For now.

DEAN
(bites his lip, like he's not sure he wants to ask)
So you've been using your, uh, freaky ESP stuff?

SAM
No.

DEAN
You sure about that? Well, I mean, now that you've got... immunity, whatever the hell that is... just wondering what other kind of weirdo crap you've got going on.

SAM
Nothing, Dean. Look, you didn't want me to go down that road, so I didn't go down that road. It was practically your dying wish.

DEAN
Yeah, well, let's keep it that way.

SAM broods.

EXT. PAMELA'S HOUSE – DAY

They knocks on the door, and PAMELA opens it. She is in her thirties, strong and beautiful with a ready smile.

PAMELA
Bobby!

She grabs him into a hug, lifting him briefly off the ground. SAM and DEAN share a look.

BOBBY
You're a sight for sore eyes.

PAMELA steps back and looks SAM and DEAN up and down appraisingly.

PAMELA
So, these the boys?

BOBBY
Sam, Dean. This is Pamela Barnes, best damn psychic in the state.

DEAN
(flirting, of course)
Hey.

SAM
(a little awkwardly)
Hi.

PAMELA
Mmm-mmm-mmm. Dean Winchester. Out of the fire and back in the frying pan, huh? Makes you a rare individual.

DEAN
If you say so.

PAMELA
Come on in.

INT. PAMELA'S HOUSE – DAY

PAMELA ushers them in, first BOBBY, then DEAN, then SAM, and shuts the door behind them.

BOBBY
So, you hear anything?

PAMELA
Well, I Ouija'd my way through a dozen spirits. No one seems to know who broke your boy out, or why.

BOBBY
So what's next?

PAMELA
A séance, I think. See if we can see who did the deed.

BOBBY
You're not gonna... summon the damn thing here.

PAMELA
No. I just want to get a sneak peek at it. Like a crystal ball without the crystal.

DEAN
I'm game.

INT. SEANCE ROOM – DAY

PAMELA spreads a black tablecloth covered in symbols over a small table. SAM and DEAN look at it warily; DEAN cocks his head as PAMELA squats in front of a cabinet, revealing a scrawled tattoo across her lower back that reads:

Jesse Forever

DEAN
Who's Jesse?

PAMELA
(laughs)
Well, it wasn't forever.

DEAN
His loss.

PAMELA stands with several pillar candles in her hands, stops in front of DEAN with a smirk.

PAMELA
Might be your gain.

As she passes by, DEAN turns to SAM and lowers his voice.

DEAN
Dude, I am so in.

SAM
Yeah, she's gonna eat you alive.

DEAN
Hey, I just got out of jail. Bring it.

PAMELA
(passing by again, to SAM with a wink)
You're invited too, grumpy.

DEAN
You are NOT invited.

LATER
PAMELA, BOBBY, SAM, and DEAN are seated around the small table, which now has six lighted candles in the center.

PAMELA
Right. Take each other's hands.
(they do)
And I need to touch something our mystery monster touched.

PAMELA slides her hand along DEAN'S inner thigh. He jumps.

DEAN
Whoa. Well, he didn't touch me there.

PAMELA
My mistake.

DEAN looks around, nervous, then takes off his outer shirt, pulls up his left t-shirt sleeve to reveal the BRAND. SAM stares at it, shocked, looks at BOBBY. PAMELA lays her hand on the BRAND.

PAMELA
Okay.
(All four close their eyes as PAMELA begins to chant)
I invoke, conjure, and command you, appear unto me before this circle.
I invoke, conjure, and command you, appear unto me before this circle.
I invoke, conjure, and command you, appear unto me before this circle.
(a television flicks on to static; she continues)
I invoke, conjure, and command... Castiel? No. Sorry, Castiel, I don't scare easy.

DEAN
Castiel?

PAMELA
Its name. It's whispering to me, warning me to turn back.
(white noise and static continues, and the table begins to shake)
I conjure and command you, show me your face.
I conjure and command you, show me your face.
I conjure and command you, show me your face.
I conjure and command you, show me your face.

BOBBY
(as the white noise and rattling become more violent)
Maybe we should stop.

PAMELA
I almost got it.
I command you, show me your face!
Show me your face now!

Suddenly the candles flare up several feet in the air and PAMELA begins to scream. Her eyes fly open and are filled with a white-hot flame. She collapses; the rattling, white noise, and flames die out.

BOBBY
(catching her and lowering her to the floor)
Call 9-1-1!

SAM scrambles out of his chair and into the next room. DEAN crouches over PAMELA and BOBBY. She is conscious, but bleeding and burned. Her eyelids fly open to reveal black, empty sockets. She sobs.

PAMELA
I can't see! I can't see! Oh god!

In the next room we can hear SAM calling for an ambulance.


END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. JOHNNY MAC'S DINER – DAY

DEAN is sitting at a table giving his order to a WAITRESS.

WAITRESS
Be up in a jiff.

As she leaves, SAM enters, talking on his cell phone.

SAM
(into the phone) You bet. (he sits)

DEAN
What'd Bobby say?

SAM
Pam's stable. And out of I.C.U.

DEAN
And blind, because of us.

SAM
And we still have no clue who we're dealing with.

DEAN
That's not entirely true.

SAM
No?

DEAN
We got a name. Castiel, or whatever. With the right mumbo-jumbo we could summon him, bring him right to us.

SAM
You're crazy. Absolutely not.

DEAN
We'll work him over. I mean, after what he did?

SAM
Pam took a peek at him and her eyes burned out of her skull, and you want to have a face to face?

DEAN
You got a better idea?

SAM
Yeah, as a matter of fact I do. I followed some demons to town, right?

DEAN
Okay.

SAM
So, we go find them. Someone's gotta know something about something.

The WAITRESS reappears with two plates of pie. She sets them on the table.

SAM
Thanks.

The WAITRESS then plops down in a chair at the end of the table. DEAN looks at her, smirking.

DEAN
You angling for a tip?

WAITRESS
I'm sorry. Thought you were looking for us.

Her eyes go demon-black for a moment; a UNIFORMED MAN by the counter and a COOK behind the counter also show the demon-black; the UNIFORMED MAN goes to the door, locks it, and stands in front of it.

DEMON WAITRESS
(eyes going back to normal) Dean. To hell and back. Aren't you a lucky duck.

DEAN
That's me.

DEMON WAITRESS
So you get to just stroll out of the pit, huh? Tell me. What makes you so special?

DEAN
I like to think it's because of my perky nipples. I don't know. Wasn't my doing, I don't know who pulled me out.

DEMON WAITRESS
Right. You don't.

DEAN
No. I don't.

DEMON WAITRESS
Lying's a sin, you know.

DEAN
I'm not lying. But I'd like to find out, so if you wouldn't mind enlightening me, Flo...

DEMON WAITRESS
Mind your tone with me, boy. I'll drag you back to hell myself.

SAM, who has been staring daggers at her through this exchange, shifts as if to attack. DEAN holds a hand up and SAM stops, settles back into his seat.

DEAN
No, you won't.

DEMON WAITRESS
No?

DEAN
No. Because if you were you would have done it already. Fact is, you don't know who cut me loose. And you're just as spooked as we are. And you're looking for answers. Well, maybe it was some turbo-charged spirit. Or, uh, Godzilla. Or some big bad boss demon. I'm guessing at your pay grade that they don't tell you squat. Because whoever it was, they want me out. And they're a lot stronger than you. So go ahead. Send me back. But don't come crawling to me when they show up on your front doorstep with some Vaseline and a fire hose.

DEMON WAITRESS
I'm going to reach down your throat and rip out your lungs.

DEAN leans forward, a challenge in his eyes. He throws a right hook at her, which she takes. He throws another. She still does nothing but glare at them, looking more and more nervous.

DEAN
That's what I thought. Let's go, Sam.

They stand, and the demon sits there, fuming. DEAN pulls a roll of cash out of his pocket and carefully peels off a ten dollar bill. He holds it up and drops it on the table like an insult.

DEAN
For the pie.

EXT. JOHNNY MAC'S DINER – DAY

SAM and DEAN stalk out of the diner and across the street, tense and quick.

DEAN
Holy crap, that was close.

SAM
We're not just going to leave them in there, are we, Dean?

DEAN
Well yeah, there's three of them, probably more, and we've only got one knife between us.

SAM
I've been killing a lot more demons than that lately.

DEAN
Not anymore – the smarter brother's back in town.

SAM
Dean, we've got to take 'em. They are dangerous.

DEAN
They're scared. Okay? Scared of whatever had the juice to yank me out. We're dealing with a bad mofo here. One job at a time.

INT. ASTORIA MOTEL – NIGHT

DEAN is dozing on the couch with a large book open in his lap. SAM sneaks out, checking to make sure DEAN doesn't wake.

EXT. ASTORIA MOTEL – NIGHT

SAM drives away in the IMPALA.

INT. ASTORIA MOTEL – NIGHT

As DEAN dozes, the television flicks on to the now-familiar static, and the radio starts whining as well. It wakes DEAN, who rubs the sleep out of his eyes and rolls quickly to grab a SHOTGUN lying by the bed. He looks around cautiously, glances at SAM'S bed and sees that it is empty. He grimaces. The painfully high-pitched noise begins again, and he grabs his right ear, keeping the weapon up in his left hand. A mirror on the ceiling shatters and rains broken glass down on him. He crumples to the ground, clutching both ears as all the glass in the room shatters explosively. He screams.

BOBBY bursts into the room as more glass shatters.

BOBBY
Dean!


END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

BOBBY drives his car as DEAN, in the passenger's seat, wipes blood from his face.

BOBBY
How you doin', kid?

DEAN
Aside from the church bells ringing in my head, peachy.

DEAN pulls out his cell phone and dials a number.

EXT. JOHNNY MAC'S DINER – NIGHT

SAM is in the IMPALA, staking out the diner full of demons. His cell phone rings; he answers it.

SAM (PHONE)
Hey.

DEAN (PHONE)
What are you doing?

SAM
Couldn't sleep, went to get a burger.

DEAN
In my car?

SAM
Force of habit, sorry. What are you doing up?

DEAN
Well, uh, Bobby's back. We're going to grab a beer.
(on BOBBY'S shocked look, DEAN holds up a finger.)

SAM
All right, well, uh, spill some for me, huh?

DEAN
Done. Catch you later.
(They hang up.)

BOBBY
Why the hell didn't you tell him?

DEAN
Because he just tried to stop us.

BOBBY
From what?

DEAN
Summoning this thing.
(BOBBY looks at him in shock. Again.)
It's time we faced it head-on.

BOBBY
You can't be serious!

DEAN
As a heart attack. It's high noon, baby.

BOBBY
Well, we don't know what it is. It could be a demon, it could be anything.

DEAN
That's why we've got to be ready for anything.
(he pulls out RUBY'S DEMON-KILLING KNIFE)
We've got the big-time magic knife, you've got an arsenal in the trunk...

BOBBY
This is a bad idea.

DEAN
Yeah, I couldn't agree more, but what other choice do we have?

BOBBY
We could choose life.

DEAN
Bobby, whatever this is, whatever it wants, it's after me. That much we know, right? I've got no place to hide. I can either get caught with my pants down again, or we can make our stand.

BOBBY
Dean, we could use Sam on this.

DEAN
Nah, he's better off where he is.


INT. JOHNNY MAC'S DINER – NIGHT

SAM sneaks into the darkened diner and slips his lock-picking tools into his shirt pocket. A song is playing on the jukebox. SAM sneaks in quietly, sees the COOK from earlier face-down on the floor, his hands bloody. SAM crouches and turns the man over; he is dead, his eyes burned out and drying blood caked on his cheeks. SAM stands.

A figure tackles him from behind – it is the DEMON WAITRESS. They trade blows for a few moments until SAM shoves her away. She too has empty, burned out eye sockets and blood trickling down her face. She looks both terrifying and terrified.

SAM
Your eyes.

DEMON WAITRESS
I can still smell your soul a mile away.

SAM
It was here. You saw it.

DEMON WAITRESS
(sobbing)
I saw it.

SAM
What was it?

DEMON WAITRESS
It's the end. We're dead. We're all dead.

SAM
(insisting)
What did you see?

DEMON WAITRESS
Go to hell.

SAM
Funny. I was going to say the same thing to you.

SAM steps back, plants his feet, and shuts his eyes in concentration. He extends his right hand towards the demon. She heaves and begins to vomit black smoke into her hand; in seconds, the WAITRESS has collapsed to the floor as the DEMON is sucked down into the Pit. SAM opens his eyes and crosses to the woman on the floor. He checks her pulse, sighs in disappointment.

SAM
Damn it.

The kitchen door opens and a woman comes out. He looks up, apparently not surprised to see her. It is the HOT YOUNG WOMAN from ACT ONE.

HOT YOUNG WOMAN (henceforth called RUBY)
Getting pretty slick there, Sam. Better all the time.

SAM stands and they share a smoldering look. He looks down at the corpse at his feet, his face falling.

SAM
What the hell is going on around here, Ruby?

RUBY
I wish I knew.

SAM
We were thinking some high level demon pulled Dean out.

RUBY
No way. Sam, human souls don't just walk out of Hell and back into their bodies easy. The sky bleeds, the ground quakes. It's cosmic. No demon can swing that. Not Lilith, not anybody.

SAM
Then what can?

RUBY
Nothing I've ever seen before.


INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

BOBBY draws a symbol with white spray paint on the cement floor. As he stands, we see that the entire floor, walls, and ceiling of the empty rectangular warehouse are covered in similar images.

DEAN
(at a table, setting up equipment)
That's a hell of an art project you've got going there.

BOBBY
Traps and talismans from every faith on the globe. How you doin?

DEAN
Stakes, iron, silver, salt, knife. I mean, we're pretty much set to catch and kill anything I've ever heard of.

BOBBY
This is still a bad idea.

DEAN
Yeah, Bobby, I heard you the first ten times. What do you say we ring the dinner bell?

BOBBY nods reluctantly. He goes over to another desk, takes a pinch of some powder from a bowl, and sprinkles it into a larger bowl, which begins to smoke. He chants in Latin.


INT. JOHHNY MAC'S DINER – NIGHT

RUBY and SAM are seated across from each other at a small table.

RUBY
So. Million dollar question, are you going to tell Dean about what we're doing?

SAM
Yeah, I just gotta figure out the right way to say it.
(RUBY gives him a look)
Look, I just need time, okay? That's all.

RUBY
Sam, he's going to find out, and if it's not from you he's going to be pissed.

SAM
He's going to be pissed anyway. I mean, he's so hardheaded about this psychic stuff he'll just try and stop me.

RUBY
Look. Maybe I'll just take a step back for a while.

SAM
Ruby, you...

RUBY
I mean, I'm not exactly in your brother's fanclub. But he is your brother, and I'm not going to come between you.

SAM
I don't know if what I'm doing is right. Hell, I don't even know if I trust you.

RUBY
Thanks.

SAM
But what I do know is that I'm saving people. And stopping demons. And that feels good. I want to keep going.


INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN and BOBBY are seated on tables, swinging their legs and looking bored.

DEAN
You sure you did the ritual right?
(BOBBY gives him a look)
Sorry. Touchy, touchy, huh?

As if on cue, a loud rattling shakes the roof. DEAN and BOBBY arm themselves with shotguns and take positions at the far end of the warehouse.

DEAN
Wishful thinking, but maybe it's just the wind.

The door bursts open and a handsome man in a business suit and trenchcoat stalks in CASTIEL.

The light bulbs above his head shatter in a shower of sparks as he passes them. As he approaches, DEAN and BOBBY both open fire, but the shots do not even slow him down. Dean takes the MAGIC KNIFE as CASTIEL gets close.

DEAN
Who are you?

CASTIEL
I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.

DEAN
Yeah. Thanks for that.

DEAN rears back and plunges the MAGIC KNIFE into CASTIEL'S chest and hits heart without any effects. CASTIEL looks down, unconcerned, and pulls it out, drops it to the floor. Behind him, BOBBY attacks; without looking, CASTIEL grabs BOBBY'S weapon and uses it to swing him around. CASTIEL touches BOBBY on the forehead with fingertips and BOBBY crumples to the ground.

CASTIEL
We need to talk, Dean. Alone.


END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
DEAN crouches over BOBBY, checking his pulse. He glares at CASTIEL.

CASTIEL
Your friend's alive.

DEAN
Who are you?

CASTIEL
Castiel.

DEAN
Yeah, I figured that much, I mean what are you?

CASTIEL
I'm an Angel of the Lord.

DEAN
Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing.

CASTIEL
This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith.

Lightning flashes, and on CASTIEL'S back great shadowy wings appear, stretching off into the distance. The light goes out and the image disappears.

DEAN
Some angel you are. You burned out that poor woman's eyes.

CASTIEL
I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... overwhelming to humans, and so can my real voice. But you already knew that.

DEAN
You mean the gas station and the motel. That was you talking? (CASTIEL nods.) Buddy, next time, lower the volume.

CASTIEL
That was my mistake. Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong.

DEAN
And what visage are you in now, huh? What, holy tax accountant?

CASTIEL
This? This is... a vessel.

DEAN
You're possessing some poor bastard?

CASTIEL
He's a devout man, he actually prayed for this.

DEAN
Well, I'm not buying what you're selling, so who are you really?

CASTIEL
(frowning) I told you.

DEAN
Right. And why would an angel rescue me from Hell?

CASTIEL
Good things do happen, Dean.

DEAN
Not in my experience.

CASTIEL
What's the matter? You don't think you deserve to be saved?

DEAN
Why'd you do it?

CASTIEL
Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you.
