TEASER

INTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[A woman is sitting in a chair, her hands tied to the back. There is a devil’s trap on the floor. She is a demon.]

DEMON

Never been caught by a human before. You some kind of hunter?

[NICK walks into the room.]

NICK

No. No, I know a couple. Picked up some tricks. And a few other things.

[NICK points an angel blade in the demon’s face.]

DEMON

Well, if you’re not a hunter, let’s make a deal.

NICK

Mnh-mnh. No deals.

[NICK makes a cut on the demon’s cheek with the angel blade.]

DEMON

What do you want?

NICK

Abraxas. The last demon I killed said you and Abraxas made quite the team. Until he was captured by a hunter. You left your pal in the lurch, but you know who got him.

DEMON

If I was there. The hunter who caught him, who almost got me -- why would I protect them? Hell, I can even tell you where to find ‘em. So… no need for any of this.

NICK

Oh, I don’t know. Where’s the fun in that?

[NICK lifts the angel blade to the demon’s neck.]

DEMON

Hibbing! She’s in Hibbing, Minnesota.

[NICK smiles. The demon’s eyes flash black as she smiled. NICK lifts the angel blade and stabs it through her eye. She screams.]

[SAM is sitting at the table, working with several books in front of him. DEAN walks in.]

DEAN

Hey.

SAM

Hey. How you feeling?

DEAN

What you reading?

SAM

Uh, going back through the Book of Jubilees. You know, the way they classify angels is – is – it’s really interesting.

DEAN

Find anything on Michael?

SAM

Not yet, but I… but I… but I just started.

[DEAN nods.]

SAM

We’ll find a way.

DEAN

Man, I-I-I… I appreciate it, you know, you… trying.

SAM

Well, yeah. Of course. I mean, always. You wanna hop in, help out? I got plenty to go through.


DEAN

Actually, I-I – I thought I’d go for a – drive, you know? Just me and Baby, long stretch of road. And figured I’d make it a twofer – I’d go see Mom at, uh, Donna’s cabin.

SAM

Yeah. Yeah, th-that’s sounds great. Be good to see ‘em. Just let me, uh, find a stopping point and get packed up.

DEAN

Uh, actually, I was, uh… was kinda hoping for some one-on-one time with Mom, if that’s cool.

SAM

Ye – uh… sure, yeah. Whatever you need.

DEAN

Okay.

[DEAN walks around behind SAM and hugs him.]

DEAN

Take care, Sammy.

[DEAN leaves the room.]

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – DAY

MARY

Yeah, he called last night.

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – DAY

[MARY is sitting at the dining table, cleaning her weapons. SAM is on speaker phone.]

MARY

Said it was just a supply run, but I’ll take any excuse for a visit. Cabin’s been a little quiet lately.

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – DAY

[SAM is walking through the bunker.]

SAM

Quiet?

MARY

Yeah, uh, Bobby took off for a few days.

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – DAY

MARY

It’s fine. Just after everything that happened with his son, we needed a little space.

SAM

Yeah.

MARY

Sam?

INTERIOR – BUNKER – DAY

SAM

Sorry, I’m just – I’m worried, you know? Ever since we locked Michael up, Dean’s been acting strange, and he just packed up and left, and then, uh…

MARY

And what?

SAM

He hugged me.

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – DAY

MARY

That’s sweet.

INTERIOR – BUNKER – DAY

SAM

Mom, we don’t hug. I mean, w-we do, but only if it’s literally the end of the world, you know?

MARY

Sam, he’ll be here soon. I’ll look after him. I’ll get to the bottom of this.

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – DAY

[MARY continues cleaning her weapons.]

SAM

Yeah, alright. M-maybe it’s like you said, you know? Maybe he just needs some space, like Bobby.

MARY

Yeah. Well, and until we know for sure, we have to respect that.

SAM

Yeah, you’re right. Uh, I-I… Yeah, uh… talk soon.

INTERIOR – BUNKER ROOM 7B – DAY

[SAM hangs up the phone. He notices a book missing from the shelf.]

EXTERIOR – HUNGRY BEAVER BURGERS – DAY

[DEAN bites into a burger. DONNA sits across from him, eating.]

DEAN

Mmm. Oh, my God.

DONNA

What? You thought I was joking? Best burger in Minnesota.

DEAN

Best burger ever.

DONNA

Glad it satisfied.

DEAN

Oh. So good.

DONNA

So, Dean.

DEAN

Have you seen Jody lately, hmm? The girls?

DONNA

Oh yeah. You know, I split my time as much as I can, help Jody with their training. Last month, we took down a Vetala nest. Alex, little miss “I don’t want to hunt”, she killed two all by herself.

DEAN

Get out of town! Good for her.

DONNA

Anyhoo…

DEAN

Now, what about you? How’s sheriffing going? I know it was a little tough last time, what with, uh…

DONNA

Doug, yeah.

DEAN

Mmhmm.

DONNA

Yeah, you know, the split was rough. Doug’s working private security now, up in Duluth.

DEAN

Okay.

DONNA

Any more questions?

DEAN

Huh?

DONNA

Just wondering if you’ve run out of ways to ask me how I’m doing, so as to avoid me repaying the favor. I know you were just possessed. Again.

[DEAN looks confused.]

DONNA

Sam. He had us all out, looking for you. And I know you got an archangel hitching a ride up there in your noggin.

[DEAN looks confused again.]

DONNA

Also Sam.

DEAN

What does he got? A freakin’ newsletter?

DONNA

I’m just saying, all that, it can’t be easy, you know?

[DEAN and DONNA look at each other.]

DEAN

Well… I’ll make it through, okay? That’s all we can do, right?

DONNA

Right.

[DEAN smiles.]

DEAN

Couldn’t come through town without seeing my D-train, so thanks for meeting me.

[DONNA smiles.]

DONNA

Oh yeah.

[They both stand up from the table.]

DEAN

Come here.

[DEAN hugs DONNA tight.]

DONNA

Ohh. You betcha.

[They pull away from each other.]

DEAN

I’ll see ya, Donna.

[DONNA looks worried as DEAN leaves.]

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – DAY

[DEAN pulls the Impala up to the back of the cabin. He gets out but turns as he hears a gunshot. He takes out his gun as he hears more gunshots and hurries to the back of the cabin. He has his gun ready as he turns the corner but sees MARY shooting pumpkins in the backyard. He puts his gun down.]

DEAN

Hey, mom.

MARY

You’re here.

[DEAN and MARY hug.]

DEAN

Yeah. Thought I’d stick around for a couple of days, if that’s cool.

MARY

Of course. Uh, Bobby’s gone. We have a big couch and a pull-out.

DEAN

Perfect.

MARY

Awesome. You know, if you wanted to make it a full reunion, we could call Sam over.

DEAN

Yeah, you know, I was thinking I’d actually be a little greedy with my Mom time, if that’s cool.

MARY

Well, I just thought, you know, if you’re staying a few nights…

DEAN

I don’t want Sam here.

MARY

Everything alright?

DEAN

Yeah, no. You know what? I just – I’m – I’m hangry, okay? Long drive, haven’t eaten, and, uh, I’m starving, actually.

MARY

Well, uh, the delivery options are a little limited this far out, and we both know I’m not much of a cook.

DEAN

Well, there’s one thing you can cook better than anybody on the planet.

[MARY thinks it over.]

MARY

Winchester Surprise?

DEAN

Yeah.

MARY

I can’t believe you remember that. I can’t believe I ever fed that to you and John. It was so greasy, like… heart attack on a plate.

DEAN

A delicious heart attack on a plate, okay? I would like mine with extra cheese.

MARY

Alright, then.

DEAN

Yes!

[MARY walks to her truck.]

DEAN

Oh, and uh…

MARY

Pie.

[MARY pulls away from the cabin. DEAN watches her leave.]

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – DAY

[DEAN opens the trunk of the Impala and takes out the duffle bag. He walks to the shed, opens the door and turns on the light. He notices the posters of shirtless men with moustaches on the walls.]

DEAN

Well, Donna certainly has a type.

[DEAN notices an old cassette player in the corner. He walks over to it but bends over. He sees MICHAEL slamming against the door in his mind. DEAN tries to focus on his surroundings, as MICHAEL continues to scream inside his head. DEAN shakes his head. He walks over to the cassette player.]

DEAN

Alright.

[DEAN takes a cassette out and puts it in the player. The music starts. He turns around and gets to work. He measures things and sets books and papers out on the table. He starts welding. Metal falls on the floor as he continues to work.]

EXTERIOR – GROCERY STORE – DAY

[MARY is carrying grocery bags and a case of beer to the truck. Someone touches her shoulder and she turns around.]

JOE

Hey. Need a hand?

MARY

Hey, Joe. Thanks.

[JOE puts the groceries in the back of the truck.]

JOE

That’s new.

MARY

What?

JOE

You buying food. I just mean, you usually only pick up whiskey, pumpkins and crossword puzzles.

MARY

Well… crosswords do get better with whiskey. And I got family in town.

JOE

Oh, nice. Well, enjoy.

MARY

Thanks.

JOE

See you later.

[MARY gets into the truck.]

EXTERIOR – GROCERY STORE – DAY

[JOE is pushing carts in the parking lot. NICK pulls up in a blue van, and calls out to JOE.]

NICK

Hey, man. Excuse me.

JOE

Hey. Can I help you?

NICK

Yeah, yeah, I think you can. I’m looking for a friend of mine – Mary Winchester.

JOE

Sorry. I don’t know her.

NICK

Well, she told me to meet her here in Hibbing, so if you could just point me in the right direction, we’re all good, you know?

[JOE says nothing.]

NICK

Thanks for nothing, pal.

[NICK drives away. JOE takes out his phone and dials a number.]

EXTERIOR – HIBBING, MINNESOTA – NIGHT

[NICK is driving. He passes a police car, which starts to flash its lights. It stops and turns to stop behind the van.]

NICK

Ah… damn it. Oh, come on, man.

[NICK stops the van and turns off the engine. He looks down at the knife on the passenger seat. He takes out a paper clip from the sun shades. The officer walks up to the van and flashes their light at NICK. It is DONNA.]

DONNA

Hiya.

NICK

Evening, Officer.

ACT TWO

EXTERIOR – HIBBING, MINNESOTA – NIGHT

[DONNA pushes NICK against the van and puts handcuffs on him.]

NICK

You can’t – I didn’t do anything.

DONNA

Oh, sure ya did. You see, I ran the plates, and this van here? Belongs to an 80-year-old lady in Missoula.

NICK

Yeah. My Grammy, she lets me borrow it.

DONNA

No. Grammy reported it stolen two weeks ago. And word has it you’re looking for a friend of mine, Mary Winchester.

NICK

No, I-I-I talked to the kid about renting a place for fishing.

DONNA

Oh. Huh. You catch a lot of fish with that Arkansas toothpick you got there on the passenger seat? So… what’s your name?

NICK

Nunya.

DONNA

What’s that?

NICK

First name, eat. Last name, me.

DONNA

Okay.

[DONNA pushes NICK into the van. She takes out something from her pocket.]

DONNA

You see this? Mobile fingerprint scanner. Cost the force a pretty penny, but I figured it’d come in handy.

[DONNA puts NICK’s finger against the device.]

DONNA

You won’t give it to me straight… but this will.

[DONNA waits for the results to show. NICK takes out the paper clip and starts to pick the lock on the handcuffs.]

DONNA

Uffta. You’re a long way from Delaware, Nick.

[DONNA turns around. NICK pushes her against the van. She pushes at his face as he tries to grab her. He drops her to the ground, but she pushes herself up. She slams him against the van, her gun to his neck.]

DONNA

Okay, sicko. That’s enough.

[NICK tasers DONNA. She falls to the ground.]

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[DEAN walks out of the shed. MARY pulls up to the cabin. He walks over to meet her and help her with the groceries.]

DEAN

Hey.

MARY

Hey. What were you doing out there?

DEAN

Oh, I, uh… oh, here. You know, I’m just, uh… taking a look around. Come on inside. I got a surprise for you.

[MARY looks back at the shed before following DEAN inside.]

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[DEAN walks into the kitchen and puts the bags on the countertop. There are two place settings at the dining table.]

MARY

What’s all this?

DEAN

Well, I wanted to make sure everything was ready for you. And I thought I’d, uh – I’d give you a hand, you know? Two terrible cooks teaming up. What could possibly go wrong?

[DEAN looks at MARY.]

DEAN

What?

MARY

Nothing.

[MARY smiles, but it morphs into a worried expression once his back is turned.]

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[DEAN is in the kitchen. He takes a dish out of the oven. MARY is on the phone with SAM.]

SAM

Listen, Mom, I-I… I think I should come up. Uh, there’s some stuff missing from the bunker, and –

MARY

Sam, I don’t know what’s going on, but something is going on. Just give me some time. Let me talk to him, okay?

SAM

Okay, yeah. Um, yeah. Alright, Mom.

[SAM hangs up the call. He is in a car, driving.]

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

DEAN

He comes back, he’s standing there,

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[DEAN is sitting across from MARY at the dining table.]

DEAN

He’s soaking wet, and he’s pulling baloney and sliced cheese out of his pants.

[MARY covers her mouth and laughs.]

DEAN

So, me being the big brother, I’m the cook. I take all that baloney, all that sliced cheese, and I put it onto a hot plate.

MARY

No.

DEAN

Yeah.

MARY

Oh.

DEAN

It stunk up that room so bad. Dad comes home, and he is so mad. He picks up everything, chucks it in the trash. Probably reminded him of you, and… Anyway, it did not taste right. It didn’t taste like this.

MARY

Oh. Sometimes I forget just how much I missed while I was gone and how much the two of you just…

DEAN

But you’re here now, right? And even though the last couple of years have been a little rough, just knowing that you’re around, that you’re alive… Mom, that’s meant everything to me. And everything to Sam.

[MARY smiles at DEAN.]

DEAN

And how great is this, hm? You and me, sitting here, eating the real thing, not some baloney version of Winchester Surprise? You know, we’re not fighting any monsters. There’s – there’s no clouds on the horizon.

MARY

Dean?

DEAN

Mm-hmm?

MARY

Whatever you’re going through, you can talk to me.

DEAN

Everybody keeps asking how I am. And how I am… is I don’t want to talk about it. Please.

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[DEAN is asleep on the couch, snoring. MARY walks down the stairs quietly, making sure DEAN is asleep. She walks out of the cabin.]

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[MARY opens the door to the shed and walks in.]

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN SHED – NIGHT

[MARY turns on the light. She looks around the room at the things Dean has left there. She picks up a piece of paper and looks at it.]

EXTERIOR – HIBBING, MINNESOTA – NIGHT

[DONNA wakes up in the police car.]

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN SHED – NIGHT

[MARY continues to look around the room. She flips through the lore books kept on the table. She finds a book and looks through it, in shock.]

MARY

No. No, no, no.

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[DEAN is snoring on the couch. His cellphone rings. He wakes up, feeling around for it. He looks at the screen.]

DEAN

What?

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN SHED – NIGHT

MARY

Oh, God.

[MARY walks out the door.]

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[MARY stops when she sees someone in front of her.]

NICK

Hey.

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[MARY’s cellphone is ringing. DEAN picks it up.]

DEAN

Hey, Donna. It’s Dean. What’s up?

INTERIOR – POLICE CAR – NIGHT

DONNA

He got the drop on me. Dean, he’s going after your mom.

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

DEAN

He who?

DONNA

Uh, some guy named Nick.

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[DEAN leaves the cabin and walks down the path. He hears something rustle behind him, and turns, aiming his gun. It’s SAM.]

SAM

Dean! Whoa, easy! Dean, what’s going on here?

DEAN

It’s Mom. She’s gone.

ACT THREE

EXTERIOR – HIBBING, MINNESOTA – NIGHT

[NICK’s van is parked on the side of a road.]

NICK

The demons, they know where you are.

INTERIOR – NICK’S VAN – NIGHT

[MARY is sitting across from NICK.]

NICK

They keep track of you, you and your kids. They’re sort of scared of you. So wherever you are, they’re not. So that’s how I got to Hibbing. I didn’t have an address. Luckily, that – that perky sheriff lady – what’s her name? Deborah? Debbie? Something? Whatever. She had, um… She had some emails on her cellphone talking about you and her family cabin. So, voila! Here I am. I know that’s a lot to take in, but… And if you feel like screaming, you can – you can go ahead, ‘cause we’re… pretty remote.

MARY

Nick? What are you doing?

[NICK gets up and sits right in front of MARY.]

NICK

Tonya Baker. Yeah, you knew her. You saved her life. Yeah, her whole Girl Scout troop was murdered. She was the only survivor, thanks to you. These two demons were about to finish her off, and then you came in, and you chased one away. But you faced off against the other one, a demon named Abraxas.

MARY

I remember. So?

NICK

So, Abraxas murdered my family the same way he killed those girls – bloody, brutal, slow.

MARY

I’m sorry, Nick. But you could’ve just asked me. This is…

NICK

Crazy? Hm? What would you have told me?

MARY

That I killed him. Abraxas is dead.

NICK

So, you would’ve lied to me. His friend got away, but she saw everything. You didn’t kill Abraxas. You trapped him in a box. How’d you do it?

MARY

Uh –

[NICK grabs MARY and holds a knife to her neck.]

NICK

Tell me.

MARY

Okay, you’re right. I trapped him. We fought, and he was winning. So, I put him in an Enochian puzzle box. He’s contained.

NICK

Do you have him?

MARY

No. But I can take you to him.

EXTERIOR – UL-2MAT STORAGE – NIGHT

[NICK drives into the storage area. A security guard watches the van drive in.]

EXTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

DONNA

I got his tags,

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN – NIGHT

[DONNA walks in and faces SAM and DEAN.]

DONNA

Put my guys on it, they’re running ‘em. I’m sorry.

DEAN

It’s not your fault, Donna.

SAM

It’s mine. Nick said when he left he was just gonna go home. I-I didn’t know he was…

DEAN

Killing people?

[DONNA’s radio cracks.]

OFFICER

Sheriff?

DONNA

Yeah. Go for Hanscum.

OFFICER

We got that van you were looking for. A traffic cam just caught it pulling into a storage facility outside Grand Rapids.

DONNA

Copy that. I got it from here.

DEAN

How far is Grand Rapids?

DONNA

30, 40 minutes.

DEAN

We’ll be there in 20.

[DEAN walks out of the cabin. DONNA follows him.]

EXTERIOR – UL-2MAT STORAGE – NIGHT

[NICK pulls the van up to the unit. He gets out of the van and MARY follows. Her hands are tied. He pushes her towards the door. She gestures to him to open the ties, but he pushes her back to the door. She opens the lock.]

INTERIOR – STORAGE UNIT – NIGHT

[NICK pushes MARY into the unit and turns on the light.]

NICK

Alright, where is it?

[MARY says nothing.]

NICK

Okay, if you do this, we’re done. You walk. Okay?

MARY

Over there.

[MARY gestures to lockers behind a gate.]

NICK

You first.

[MARY walks forward and steps over something. NICK steps up behind her but notices a trip wire. The trip wire is attached to a shotgun.]

NICK

Clever.

[NICK steps over the trip wire, then cuts it with the knife.]

NICK

Alright, where is it?

MARY

In the lockers. Too bad I forgot the keys.

[NICK picks up a hammer and breaks the lock on the gate in front of the lockers. He grabs MARY’s arm and pushes her in.]

NICK

Which one?

[MARY keeps quiet.]

NICK

Alright, fine.

[NICK breaks a lock on a locker and opens it, seeing a bloody head in a jar inside. He looks at MARY, and she shrugs. He opens another locker and sees a doll in plastic bag inside. He breaks another lock and then looks at MARY once the locker is open.]

NICK

Bingo.

[NICK takes out the box and hands it to MARY.]

NICK

Open it. Me and ‘Brax-y have to have a talk.

MARY

Well, that’s not gonna happen.

NICK

I’m sorry?

MARY

To talk, a demon needs a host. It can’t be you. Can’t be me.

[MARY lifts up her shirt to show her anti-possession tattoo.]

MARY

Didn’t really think this through, did you, Nick?

NICK

So, I’ll improvise.

EXTERIOR – HIGHWAY – NIGHT

[Thunder cracks. A police car drives on the highway. The Impala follows.]

INTERIOR – IMPALA – NIGHT

[DEAN is driving. SAM sits in the passenger seat.]

SAM

Say it. I can see you want to. Might as well go ahead and say it.

DEAN

Alright. Nick is not a project. He’s a freakin’ puppy. He was Lucifer’s vessel for years.

SAM

I know that, Dean. I thought --

DEAN

You thought he’d what? Just walk it off? Come on, man. You’re not that dumb.

SAM

It’s not about being dumb, Dean. It’s called compassion. Look, what happened to Nick could’ve happened to me. It almost happened to me. You change one little thing in our past, and that was me. Lucifer wearing me to the prom. And besides, since when do we give up on people? Since when do we just cut people loose?

DEAN

Well, maybe you need to learn, okay? ‘Cause when people are past the point of saving, maybe you need to learn to walk away.

[SAM turns away from DEAN and looks out the window.]

ACT FOUR

INTERIOR – STORAGE UNIT – NIGHT

[NICK has the Enochian box in his hands. A man is sitting in a chair in the middle of the room, a devil’s trap around him. NICK takes off the cover from his head. It is the security guard.]

MARY

Nick, don’t do this.

SECURITY GUARD

Do what?

MARY

You let that demon out of there, he could kill us.

NICK

I can handle it. How do you open this thing?

MARY

I don’t know.

NICK

Mnh. I don’t like you.

[MARY looks at the guard before she lunges at NICK, and kicks him in the leg. The box falls on the ground. MARY pushes it away. It lands in the devil’s trap. NICK punches her in the face. He drags her to the gate, and pushes her against it.]

NICK

I said I can handle it.

[NICK picks up the box. He tries to turn the button on it and it starts to turn, but it does nothing and locks again. He throws it on the floor. He sees an electric screwdriver on the table and picks it up.]

NICK

I think there’s only one way to get into this box.

[NICK plugs in the screwdriver and walks over to the box. He starts to drill a hole into it.]

NICK

Come on, baby.

[The demon smoke comes out of the box, floating into the security guard. The demon, ABRAXAS wakes up and sees he is trapped. He looks at MARY.]

ABRAXAS

Heya, blondie.

[ABRAXAS blows MARY a kiss.]

ABRAXAS

Missed ya.

NICK

Why did you kill my family?

ABRAXAS

Who’s he? Sorry, you’re gonna have to be more specific.

NICK

Pike Creek, Delaware.

ABRAXAS

Oh… no way. Nick? What are you doing walking and talking? I thought the big man had you on lock.

NICK

Lucifer’s dead.

ABRAXAS

Is he? Cool.

NICK

Why did you kill my family?

ABRAXAS

Kill your family, yeah, got it. Tell you what – I’ll answer that when you kill her.

[ABRAXAS looks at MARY.]

ABRAXAS

She locked me in a box, and I hold a grudge. Do her slow and bloody, then we’ll chat.

MARY

Nick.

[NICK takes a knife out from his pocket. He lifts MARY up from the ground.]

MARY

Nick, no. Nick, hey! Don’t – stop – n-no!

[A gunshot hits the gate, hurting the side of NICK’s head. He moves away from MARY.]

SAM

Get away from her! Stay back.

[SAM and DEAN enter the room. DONNA follows behind them. SAM and DONNA have their guns aimed. DEAN rushes over to MARY, and takes the ties off her hands.]

SAM

Is she alright?

DEAN

She’s good.

SAM

What’s wrong with you? What are you doing?

NICK

What I have to.

[NICK picks up the angel blade and cuts the devil’s trap.]

MARY

No, Nick!

SAM

No!

[The warding on the devil’s trap lights up and fades.]

ABRAXAS

Showtime.

[ABRAXAS rips the ties off, and gets up from the chair. He lifts his arms up, and everyone in the room floats up in the air. He puts his arms down, and they all fall to the ground. He walks over to NICK.]

ABRAXAS

You want to know why I gutted your family? Orders. I was following orders.

NICK

From who?

ABRAXAS

Who do you think? Lucifer planned the whole thing.

NICK

I don’t – I don’t understand. Why my family? Why – why me?

ABRAXAS

No particular reason. You were chosen, but you’re not special. We threw a dart at the phone book.

[DEAN gets up from the floor.]

DEAN

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica –

ABRAXAS

Naughty.

[ABRAXAS slams DEAN back against the shelves. He turns back to NICK.]

ABRAXAS

So… who dies first?

[MARY stands up, a blade in her hand. NICK grabs ABRAXAS from the back of his neck and stabs his chest with the angel blade. The orange light flickers as ABRAXAS screams. NICK takes the angel blade out. ABRAXAS falls to the floor, dead.]

[NICK moves back, the angel blade still in his hands.]

SAM

Nick. Nick, take it easy.

[MARY walks toward NICK. He tries to swing the angel blade at her, but a gunshot rings out, the bullet hitting his leg. He falls to the floor. DONNA gets up, gun in hand. MARY punches NICK in the face, knocking him out.]

ACT FIVE

EXTERIOR – UL-2MAT STORAGE – NIGHT

[DONNA walks NICK out to the police car, his hands cuffed at his back. MARY, DEAN and SAM follow them out. DONNA opens the door to the police car, as SAM walks over. DEAN and MARY stand next to the Impala.]

DEAN

You okay?

MARY

Yeah, I’m fine.

SAM

Donna. Hold on.

[DONNA waits with NICK.]

DONNA

Yeah. Sure.

[SAM stands in front of NICK.]

SAM

Why?

NICK

I needed the truth, Sam. I needed revenge for my family. You would’ve done the same thing.

SAM

I’m sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t help you. I’m sorry I didn’t know how.

NICK

It’s not about you, Sam. It’s never about you. You couldn’t fix me ‘cause I don’t want to be fixed. I was never broken.

SAM

Yeah, Nick, you are. I don’t feel sorry for you, Nick. I feel sorry for the people you hurt, the people you murdered, the people whose faces will haunt you… every night for the rest of your life. You can burn.

[SAM nods to DONNA. She steps forward and takes NICK, pushing him into the police car.]

DONNA

Mind your head.

[MARY and DEAN watch from where they are standing.]

MARY

I saw, Dean. Donna’s shed. I know what you’ve been building, planning. And we’re gonna talk about that. We are all three of us gonna talk about that. So if you don’t tell Sam… I will.

[DEAN nods.]

INTERIOR – DONNA’S CABIN SHED – NIGHT

DEAN

It’s a Ma’lak box.

[DEAN closes the door to the box. He and SAM are standing over it.]

DEAN

Secured and warded. Once inside… nothing gets out, not even an archangel. Especially an archangel.

SAM

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ve – I’ve read about these, but – but no one’s ever – they’re impossible to build.

DEAN

Yeah, well, not so much.

SAM

That’s your plan? You want to be buried alive?

DEAN

Buried’s not safe enough. Plan is, pay a little hush money, charter a boat to take me out to the Pacific. Splash.

SAM

You and Michael, trapped together – for eternity?

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

You do realise how insane this is, right?

DEAN

It’s the only sane play I’ve got. Michael gets out, that’s it for this world. And he will get out.

SAM

Well, how do you know that for sure?

DEAN

Because I do. Because I can feel him in my head. That door is giving. I can feel it giving.

SAM

But there has to be another way.

DEAN

There’s not, okay? There – Sam you’ve tried. Cas has tried. Jack… And I love you for trying. But none of it’s gonna work.

SAM

We don’t know that.

DEAN

Yeah, we do.

SAM

What?

DEAN

Billie.

SAM

Billie?

DEAN

She paid me a little visit. She said that there’s only one way this ends right. And this is it. This, right here, this box. So, she gave up the special recipe, and all I had to do was the work. It’s fate.

SAM

Since when do we believe in fate?

DEAN

Now, Sam. Since now.

[SAM shakes his head.]

SAM

So… you came out here to see Donna, to see Mom on some – some what? Some sick, secret farewell tour? You were gonna leave, and you weren’t even gonna tell me. Me. Do you realise how messed up that is, how unfair that is?

DEAN

I didn’t have a choice! Sam, you’re the last person I could tell, the last person I could be around, ‘cause you’re the only one that could’ve talked me out of it. And I won’t talked out of it. I won’t. I’m doing this. Now, you can either let me do it alone… or you could help me. But I’m doing this.

[SAM shakes his head. He turns away. He looks back at the box and nods.]

SAM

Alright.
