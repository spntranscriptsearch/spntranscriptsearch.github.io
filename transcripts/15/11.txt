INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[A group of men gather around a pool table. LEONARD is losing, as sweat drips down his face. JOEY SIX sinks another ball into the pocket. EVIE stands by and watches the game.]

LEONARD

Come on, Joey. Give me a chance.

[JOEY SIX ignores him and continues to play.]

JOEY SIX

Bank side.

[He hits the eight ball into the pocket.]

LEONARD

What? No. No, no.

[A shimmering green light reflects around a coin in the holder above the pool table. LEONARD takes it out from the holder and looks at it.]

LEONARD

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[He picks up a pool cue and tries to hit JOEY SIX. PAX intervenes and stops him.]

PAX

Hey! No fights.

[PAX grabs LEONARD by the collar and walks him out. JOEY SIX takes the coin in his hand, kisses it and smiles at EVIE.]

EXTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

LEONARD

Aah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Come on!

[PAX shoves LEONARD out the doors.]

PAX

You know the rules.

LEONARD

Just… Just one more game, please. You know I’m good for it. Aah!

[PAX shoves him to the ground.]

PAX

Sorry, pal. You’re out of luck.

[PAX walks back inside the bar and closes the doors.]

LEONARD

Come on! Come on!

[LEONARD picks up his broken glasses from the floor and puts them on. He looks at the bar before he walks away.]

LEONARD

Great, Leonard. Great.

[LEONARD takes out the coin and looks at it. He flips it up in the air. As it spins up, he steps back on the road. A truck’s horn sounds, but hits LEONARD.]

ACT ONE
INTERIOR – BUNKER – NIGHT

[CAS walks into the bunker and looks down at the war room from the balcony. The bunker is empty with only a few lights on.]

CAS

Sam? Dean?

[CAS sees a piece of paper on the table in the library.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[CAS turns the paper around and sees the note written by SAM. “Cass, we’ve gone to Alaska. Sam.”]

CAS

Alaska.

EXTERIOR – HIGHWAY – NIGHT

[The Impala drives down the highway.]

INTERIOR – IMPALA – NIGHT

[SAM is checking the messages on his phone as it continues to chime. DEAN glares at the phone.]

DEAN

Silent mode’s always an option.

SAM

Yeah. Right. Sorry.

DEAN

And how’s Eileen doing?

SAM

She’s hanging in there. She thinks our plan sounds a little too good to be true. You know, maybe she’s right. I mean, how long have we been on the road looking for some place Garth says will supercharge our luck, maybe? And I mean, luck? Is that really even gonna fix our whole “problem”?

DEAN

Well, it couldn’t hurt. And I don’t know how much more of this “normal life” crap I can take, between the credit cards, the car trouble, the constant freaking heartburn.

SAM

Well, you know, if you changed your diet…

[DEAN glares at SAM.]

SAM

All I’m saying is that this place… it’s not even in the lore. Other than Garth, no one’s ever even heard of it.

DEAN

No, it’s there. It’s gotta be. I mean, Chuck didn’t do this to us just to teach us some messed-up lesson. You know, he wants us off our game. He wants us weak. ‘Cause he’s coming for us, Sammy. And when he does, if we haven’t figured this out, we’re DOA.

INTERIOR – BUNKER HALLWAY/SAM’S ROOM – DAY

[CAS walks down the hallway and hears a cellphone ringing. He walks into SAM’s room and picks it up.]

INTERIOR/EXTERIOR – SAM’S ROOM/CUSHING, OKLAHOMA - DAY

CAS

Hello?

[A police officer gets into his car as he talks into his phone.]

SHERIFF EVANS

Uh, yeah, Jeb Evans. Sheriff’s Department. Cushing, Oklahoma. Uh, I’m looking for an FBI Agent Watts?

CAS

Um, yeah, Agent Watts is working a case in, uh, Alaska. This is Agent, uh, Lizzo.

SHERIFF EVANS

Hmm. Well, I guess a fed’s a fed, right? [He laughs.] Listen, we got a homicide down here, and my file says that our suspect might be one of yours.

CAS

The murderer is someone we’re looking for?

SHERIFF EVANS

It says Agent Watts started a file on him last spring and to call with any information regarding a, uh, Jack Kline?

[CAS pulls the phone away from his ear and shakes his head.]

CAS

Jack.

SHERIFF EVANS

That name ring a bell?

[CAS puts the phone back to his ear.]

CAS

Yeah.

EXTERIOR – CAFÉ – DAY

[The Impala pulls up outside a café.]

INTERIOR – IMPALA – DAY

[SAM is sleeping with his head against the window. DEAN taps him on the shoulder.]

DEAN

Hey.

SAM

[wakes up.] Hey.

[He looks out the window at the café sign.]

What are we doing? Why did we stop?

DEAN

Last call on food for the next few hundred miles.

SAM

Grab something out of the cooler.

DEAN

Oh, yeah, no, I polished off the last of the sandwiches while you were out.

[SAM glares at DEAN.]

SAM

We’re on a budget.

INTERIOR – CAFÉ – DAY

[DEAN puts down some change on the counter.]

DEAN

What can we get for, uh, $4.60?

[A WAITRESS walks over to them.]

WAITRESS

Um, a slice of pie and a cup of coffee?

DEAN

Two forks?

[The WAITRESS smiles and walks away.]

DEAN

Damn it, I was hoping for a cheeseburger.

SAM

You can’t even digest cheese anymore.

[They sit down at the counter. SAM takes out a map.]

DEAN

Dude. Lactaid.

SAM

Alright. So, if Garth is right, we take this road but honestly, it doesn’t look there’s anything up there.

[The WAITRESS returns with their coffees.]

DEAN

Hey, how long have you lived here?

WAITRESS

All my life.

DEAN

Great. [points to the map.] Can you tell us what is up that road?

WAITRESS

No. Are you for real? Did Candy put you up to this?

SAM

No, nobody put us up to this. We’re… we’re just headed that way and wanted to know if there’s anything up there.

WAITRESS

Um, forget it. Sounds nuts.

DEAN

Nuts is good, yeah. A couple of Mister Freaking Peanuts here.

[The WAITRESS chuckles slightly before she leans down closer to SAM and DEAN.]

WAITRESS

Okay. There’s… There’s kind of this, um, urban legend around here, about this place in the middle of nowhere. It’s a-a pool hall that is… magic?

SAM

Magic pool hall?

WAITRESS

I told ya. They say that if you get up there and you win, then you come back lucky. Like, hit the Powerball lucky.

DEAN

Sounds good to me.

WAITRESS

Except for no one ever does.

SAM

What do you mean?

WAITRESS

Um, one of our regulars, Leonard. The bank was coming for his house, so he went out to find the place and he never came back. Heard he had some sort of accident.

[The phone rings.]

WAITRESS

Excuse me.

SAM/DEAN

Yeah.

[The WAITRESS walks away.]

SAM

Okay. I guess now we know what the downside is.

DEAN

Eh, not from where I’m sitting.

SAM

A-A pool hall that makes you lucky or might kill you? I mean, it sounds like a demon or a witch or…

DEAN

Or it could be awesome. It’s pool. The- the- the game of champions, kings. My game. Hell, our game. How many honest-to-goodness great memories do we have hustling pool?

SAM

Yeah, because we had to. To eat.

DEAN

Okay, well, my point is, that if pool is the way we get our mojo back, then maybe we ain’t as screwed as thought.

[The WAITRESS looks out the window and then turns to SAM and DEAN.]

WAITRESS

Hey, you guys drive an Impala?

[The boys look out the window.]

WAITRESS

I, uh, I think you have a flat.

[DEAN sighs and then looks at SAM.]

INTERIOR/EXTERIOR – BUNKER/OKLAHOMA – DAY

[CAS sits at the map table in the war room, the laptop open in front of him. SHERIFF EVANS is on speaker phone.]

SHERIFF EVANS

Okay, you got the video, right?

CAS

Uh, yes.

SHERIFF EVANS

Okay, so, so, Vic was a local doctor, and the office security cameras gave us a good idea of what went down.

CAS

Just an idea?

SHERIFF EVANS

You’ll see. Now, Dr. Sariel was a good man. He delivered both of my kids.

[CAS watches the video and sees JACK looking through the window of the doctor’s office.]

CAS

Jack.

SHERIFF EVANS

This thing’s got people pretty spooked.

[The video shows the doctor opening the door to his office and talking to Jack. Jack looks away before he looks back at the doctor and punches his hand through the doctor’s chest. The screen crackles, as the video blurs.]

CAS

I don’t understand.

SHERIFF EVANS

Me neither. Signal goes out for about two and a half minutes, during which time the suspect kills the doc in his office.

CAS

Why?

SHERIFF EVANS

Keep watching.

[In the video, JACK walks into the doctor’s office with his heart in his hands. He sits down on a chair and brings the heart to his mouth.]

CAS

Is that…?

[JACK bites into the heart.]

CAS

That’s his heart.

[The video pauses on JACK eating the heart.]

ACT TWO
EXTERIOR – LURLENE’S – DAY

[The Impala pulls up outside the pool hall. SAM and DEAN get out of the car.]

DEAN

Relax. We might actually have some fun.

SAM

Right.

INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – DAY

[People are playing pool inside. DEAN walks through the door followed by SAM.]

SAM

Dean, we don’t even have beer money, much less whatever the buy-in is here.

DEAN

Hey, we’ll figure something out.

[The boys walk over to the bar.]

EVIE

Get you something?

DEAN

Yeah. Two waters, por favor.

[They sat down at the bar.]

DEAN

Hey, uh…

[EVIE looks up at DEAN while pouring water into the glasses.]

EVIE

Evie.

DEAN

Evie. Say, listen, if uh, me and my brother here wanted to get ourselves a game…?

[EVIE puts the glasses in front of them.]

EVIE

Pax. Two more for ya.

[PAX walks over to the boys.]

SAM

Hey, you remember a guy who was in here a few weeks ago? Uh, name was Leonard?

EVIE

No. Sorry.

PAX

Follow me.

[SAM and DEAN walk behind PAX.]

PAX

So, how’d you guys find us?

SAM

Uh, a friend.

PAX

Did your, uh, friend say how we wager?

DEAN

Yeah, listen uh, money’s a little tight right now.

PAX

Yeah, we don’t bet with money.

[He opens a box and takes out a coin. He shows it to the boys.]

PAX

We use this.

[He puts it on the desk he’s standing at and slides it across to them.]

SAM

Okay. What are we looking at?

PAX

Go ahead. Touch it.

[DEAN looks at SAM, who shrugs. DEAN nods before he presses two fingers against the surface of the coin. A green shimmering light glows from the coin under his fingers. DEAN looks down at it as it disappears. He pulls his fingers away.]

PAX

Not great. Not the worst, either.

DEAN

And that means…?

PAX

Well, you see, everybody walks in here with a certain amount of luck. That glow… that’s you. About average.

DEAN

Yeah, that sounds about right.

PAX

But you set that coin on… on that table, you get yourself a game.

[He points at the pool table behind SAM and DEAN.]

PAX

And you win? You just might see your fortune improve.

SAM

And if he loses?

PAX

Play again. Have a good time. You know, keep playing. But if the coin goes blank, that means you’re out of luck. You gotta leave. Questions?

SAM

Yeah. What is this place? Who owns it?

PAX

I just work here. Look, if you don’t like it, the door’s open.

[PAX sits down at the desk.]

DEAN

When I win, can I split it? The luck?

PAX

It’s yours. You do what you want.

SAM

Yeah. Uh, just give us a second. Thanks.

[SAM and DEAN walk a little further away from PAX.]

SAM

No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No way.

DEAN

Man, I’ve been slinging pool cues since before you were born.

SAM

What? When you were four? Really? What, between nap time and snack?

DEAN

Look, we barely made it out of that monster fight club, okay? We need this. And you know it. Now, look, you’re better than me at pretty much everything, okay? That’s okay. I’m not mad. I’m proud. But I can wipe the floor with you when it comes to pool.

[SAM scoffs. He sighs before he nods.]

DEAN

Good. Alright.

[DEAN turns back to PAX.]

DEAN

Okay, pal. Let’s give it a go.

INTERIOR – DOCTOR’S OFFICE – DAY

[CAS walks into the doctor’s office. He removes the police tape and steps through. He looks through files and around the room.]

INTERIOR – EXAM ROOM – DAY

[CAS walks into the exam room and sees a puddle of blood on the floor. He looks through cupboards and drawers, before he sees a lock on a cupboard. He breaks the lock, moves the lab coats aside and sees a large, black case inside. He takes it out and places it on the exam table. He opens it and sees a large sword inside; a Grigori sword.]

[FLASHBACK to 10.20 Angel Heart. SAM sits tied to a chair. TAMIEL stands in front of him with his sword.]

TAMIEL

I’m a Grigori. Each of our names is inscribed on our swords. A brotherhood of perfectly crafted beings.

INTERIOR – EXAM ROOM – DAY

[CAS picks up the sword and looks at it closely.]

EXTERIOR – STREET – DAY

[A Grigori, KABAIEL walks down the street with his case. JACK follows behind him.]

INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – DAY

[DEAN walks around the pool table, pool cue in hand. He stands next to SAM.]

SAM

So, how long are we supposed to just wait around?

DEAN

You know, if the fish aren’t biting, throw ‘em a little chum.

[DEAN leans down and hits the cue ball into the balls. They disperse around the table.]

DEAN

I don’t know, Sammy. I’m a little rusty.

[MOIRA looks around the room. She throws back the shot of drink she has and walks over to DEAN. She places her coin in the holder.]

MOIRA

Go on. Rack ‘em up.

DEAN

Yeah, yeah.

[SAM walks over to EVIE who watches from the bar.]

EVIE

Decided not to play?

SAM

Uh, yeah. It’s not really my thing.

[SAM sits down at the bar. Back at the pool table, DEAN picks up his coin and places it in the holder.]

SAM

So, what’s her deal?

EVIE

Who? Moira? Been here a while. Guess her sister’s still in a coma.

SAM

So, she’s playing to wake her up?

EVIE

Everybody wants something.

SAM

Yeah.

[They watch DEAN and MOIRA playing.]

SAM

Hey, do you ever smell anything weird, like rotten eggs, or…?

EVIE

Just Charlie.

[SAM looks back at the pool table to see CHARLIE playing.]

SAM

Right. What about… have you ever noticed little bundles laying around?

EVIE

Uh… no. Look, you’re new. I get it. You’re trying to figure this out. I guess it is pretty unbelievable.

SAM

Places like this don’t exist for no reason.

EVIE

Most people think it’s a Godsend. Take that guy.

[They both look over at one of the players, dressed in a suit.]

EVIE

Loves his wife, but she has expensive taste. He came here from Atlantic City, not a dime left to his name. Or her…

[A woman walks past holding her drink.]

EVIE

Three kids, works doubles, buys a scratcher every night. They both deserve a lucky break. And they almost got one. They went on a streak, could have walked away winners, but they kept on playing till their luck went sour.

SAM

They’re not actually winning?

EVIE

Not anymore. Like I said, they should have walked away.

[At the pool table, DEAN hits the ball into the pocket. The glow around his coin shimmers. MOIRA watches.]

MOIRA

Damn it.

INTERIOR – FACTORY – DAY

[JACK walks into the factory. He walks around and takes out an Angel Blade from his jacket. He turns the corner, but the Grigori, KABAIEL comes up behind him, holding the sword to him.

KABAIEL

Why are you following me?

INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN sit at the bar.]

SAM

It felt like a warning, like she was telling me to cut our losses.

DEAN

Come on, man. I’m on a roll.

SAM

Dean, you won one game. Listen, I think this place sucks you in, right? And if you keep playing, you’ll lose. And if you keep losing…

DEAN

You go all Leonard.

SAM

Exactly.

DEAN

Alright, so we need to minimize our risk and maximize our profit, right? It’s kind of like that action we took back in Tallahassee. Remember that? The… The… The “Fast Eddie”?

SAM

I don’t remember.

DEAN

It was dad’s favorite, from the movie. Paul Newman. “The Hustler”.

SAM

[sighs.] Alright, fine. One more game. One.

DEAN

Okay. Now we just gotta find our Jackie Gleason.

[DEAN watches JOEY SIX as he plays.]

INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[DEAN hits the cue ball into the other ball and sinks it into the pocket. JOEY SIX watches.]

JOEY SIX

What did you say your name was again?

DEAN

Well, my name’s Dean Winchester. And I’m gonna kick your ass.

[DEAN leans down and lines up his shot.]

DEAN

Now, what kind of name is, uh, Joey Six?

JOEY SIX

Oh, it’s just something they used to call me back in PBR.

DEAN

Professional bull riding circuit. Nice.

[DEAN takes the shot and the ball rolls into the pocket.]

DEAN

Tell me. How was that?

[DEAN lines up another shot.]

DEAN

Corner pocket.

[He hits the cue ball into the eight ball, but it stops short of the pocket.]

JOEY SIX

Good times.

[JOEY SIX lines up shot but the ball misses the pocket.]

JOEY SIX

And some not so good.

[DEAN looks down at the table to see the cue ball next to a striped ball which is next to the eight ball. He angles the pool cue against the cue ball.]

JOEY SIX

Double or nothing says you miss that shot.

DEAN

You trying to hustle me, Rodeo?

JOEY SIX

I thought you were gonna kick my ass.

DEAN

Alright.

[DEAN angles the pool cue and hits the cue ball. It jumps the striped ball and hits the eight ball into the pocket. Everyone in the bar, cheers and claps.]

JOEY SIX

Helluva shot.

[The glow shimmers around JOEY SIX’s coin before the coin goes blank. The luck transfers to DEAN’s coin. JOEY SIX takes out his coin and walks away. DEAN takes out his coin and looks at it.]

EXTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[JOEY SIX exits the bar and sits down outside, breathing heavily. SAM and DEAN exit the bar and see him sitting outside.]

SAM

Hey.

JOEY SIX

[points at DEAN.] Good game. Guess you can hustle a hustler.

DEAN

Yeah, I guess you can.

[JOEY SIX turns the blank coin in his hand before putting it down. He starts coughing heavily. SAM moves towards him.]

JOEY SIX

Stay back.

[Blood splutters from mouth onto his hand.]

Damn it.

[He takes out a packet of cigarettes.]

JOEY SIX

Let an old man go die in peace, huh?

SAM

Wait, you’re dying?

JOEY SIX

Cancer. I came out here to beat it. I did win me an extra year. Been saving this.

[He puts the cigarette in his mouth and lights it. He continues to cough heavily.]

ACT THREE
INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[People continue to play pool. SAM and DEAN walk in.]

DEAN

Yeah, I liked that leathery son of a bitch.

SAM

Yeah, when he bet double or nothing, you cleaned him out.

DEAN

Okay, well, plan worked. Let’s hit the road.

SAM

What about everybody else? Just give me some time, alright? I-I need to figure this out.

DEAN

Dude, we’re in a fight with God, okay? And… we just got our mojo back.

SAM

You really think there’s enough luck in that coin to make up for whatever Chuck took from us?

DEAN

Why don’t I give it a whirl?

SAM

How?

DEAN

I’ll go for a quick drive. If Baby treats me right, then I know we’re out of the woods. But when I get back, it’s adios.

INTERIOR – FACTORY – NIGHT

[SHERIFF EVANS walks into the factory, holding a torch. He shines the light on the ground and sees blood on the floor. CAS walks over to him and takes out his badge, upside down before he turns it the right way.]

SHERIFF EVANS

Oh, uh, Agent Liz… Lizzo. Evans.

[They shake hands.]

CAS

Hi.

SHERIFF EVANS

Glad you came.

CAS

Glad you called.

SHERIFF EVANS

So, local transient spotted our boy in some sort of an altercation.

CAS

Did they say with whom?

SHERIFF EVANS

No. She ran the other way when she saw the other guy had a… sword. Looks like he used it.

[He looks down at the blood on the ground.]

CAS

Are there any abandoned buildings in town?

SHERIFF EVANS

Yeah, I-I guess. I mean, there’s uh, plenty of old cattle barns, empty warehouses, old church, that kind of thing.

CAS

Church. Where’s the church?

SHERIFF EVANS

Uh, two blocks down on your right.

CAS

Thank you.

[CAS walks away.]

SHERIFF EVANS

Uh, Agent?

[CAS turns back.]

SHERIFF EVANS

I called you for answers.

CAS

I know. And I intend to find them.

INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[SAM is talking to CHARLIE.]

CHARLIE

And then the Vikes finally win the Super Bowl.

SAM

Right, that’s great. It is. But is it really worth your life?

CHARLIE

Look, man, just… just one more game.

[SAM sighs and walks way.]

EVIE

Nice try. Too bad no one will listen. None of us are going anywhere.

SAM

Are they trapped here?

[EVIE glares at SAM.]

SAM

Are you?

[EVIE walks away from SAM. DEAN walks in.]

DEAN

Well, car’s dead. Again. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. This coin blows. I think you’re right. Didn’t have enough juice.

SAM

Hold on.

[SAM picks up the coin and looks at it.]

SAM

No way.

SAM

At first I thought maybe these coins were, were hexed or cursed.

[SAM takes out another coin and looks at both of them.]

DEAN

Like the rabbit’s foot.

SAM

When you win, you’re, you’re taking luck from whoever you beat, right?

DEAN

Right.

SAM

But Joey Six beat how many people? 30? 40? More? All of that accumulated luck should’ve been passed to you.

DEAN

Well, tell that to Baby.

SAM

Exactly. It didn’t. Because what if someone’s stealing, every game, skimming luck off the top?

DEAN

What… what do you mean? Like, the house?

[SAM holds up the coin. It has a face on it.]

SAM

Her. I think.

[DEAN takes the coin and reads what is written on it.]

DEAN

“Atrox Fortuna”?

SAM

She’s the Roman Goddess of Luck.

DEAN

Okay, say you’re right. What do we do?

INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN stand in front of EVIE.]

EVIE

I-I can’t help you. I’m sorry.

SAM

Then why warn me in the first place?

EVIE

So you’d take your brother and go.

DEAN

Wait, why are you here? Does she have something over you?

EVIE

I came to play. I lost. I’m only alive ‘cause she lets me stay. Long as I keep working.

DEAN

So, if you don’t play yourself to death, you work yourself to death. Is that it?

EVIE

Yeah, that’s it.

SAM

Is she here?

EVIE

I don’t know. I only talk to Pax. Her son.

[SAM and DEAN look over at PAX who sits at his desk.]

INTERIOR – CHURCH – NIGHT

[JACK kneels on the floor, his hands tied behind his back. There is a cut across his body, blood seeping through his shirt.

KABAIEL

You should heal that.

[He takes out a knife from a kit.]

KABAIEL

I know what you are. You’re powerful. Why not use it? Fight back?

[He takes off his jacket as he walks over to JACK.]

KABAIEL

As a soldier, I respect your silence, tactically misguided as it may be. For example, when I ask why are you killing my kind, you should answer so I won’t hurt you.

[He crouches in front of JACK. He opens the switch blade and points it towards him.]

KABAIEL

Why did you kill them? We Grigori have our own frequency of angel radio. Did you know that? Before he died, my brother called to me. Did you want him to? To draw me out? Kill me, too?

INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[SAM walks over to PAX.]

SAM

Pax. Hey, uh, can I ask you a question?

[PAX stands up from the desk. DEAN comes up behind him and holds a brass blade to his throat.]

SAM

Where’s your mom? Fortuna!

DEAN

We have your son.

[MOIRA, now FORTUNA walks into the room and around everyone else in the bar. She walks over to SAM and DEAN.]

FORTUNA

Enough!

[DEAN looks over at her.]

DEAN

Fortuna?

FORTUNA

That’s one of my names.

SAM

We know you’re skimming luck off what we won. We want it back.

DEAN

Or I kill him.

FORTUNA

Well, you probably could. His daddy was human. But, no.

PAX

Mom.

FORTUNA

I’m sorry, baby. I can always make more sons.

[SAM and DEAN look at each other. DEAN steps away from PAX.]

DEAN

Then play me for it.

FORTUNA

I played you already.

DEAN

Then we go again.

FORTUNA

When I play someone, I get a read on them. And you… you’re just a beach read. Sexy, mm, but skimmable.

DEAN

Beach read? Lady, I’m Tolstoy.

[FORTUNA laughs.]

FORTUNA

That’s very funny. This one here… He could be interesting.

[She walks over to SAM.]

DEAN

Wait. No, no, no. That’s… uh-uh.

SAM

Fine. Yeah, I’ll play. But not for our luck. I’ll play for the lives of everybody in here.

FORTUNA

No. Only for your luck. And if you lose, I get your lives. Come on, you threatened by baby, my livelihood. An example must be made.

[She turns to SAM.]

FORTUNA

So… are you in?

INTERIOR – CHURCH – NIGHT

[KABAIEL cuts down JACK’s throat. JACK has several cuts across his chest, his shirt is ripped open. He chuckles.]

JACK

You can’t kill me.

KABAIEL

I can make you suffer. You killed the last of my kind. You ate their hearts! This is more than fair.

JACK

Fair? The last one I killed was pretending to be a doctor. Feeding on the souls of humans he was supposed to heal. You do it, too. Only you like children.

[KABAIEL stands up and closes the switch blade. He picks up the sword and points it towards JACK.]

KABAIEL

Who told you that?

JACK

Death.

[KABAIEL swings the sword but turns around to see CAS behind him. They fight, but as he moves CAS stabs him with the other Grigori sword. He falls to the floor, dead. CAS drops the sword and walks towards JACK.]

CAS

Jack?

[JACK looks up at CAS. CAS walks over to him and kneels down behind him. He opens the ropes around JACK’s hands. He helps JACK up and looks at him. They hug each other.]

ACT FOUR
INTERIOR – LURLENE’S – NIGHT

[SAM hits the cue ball into the balls, sinking a striped ball into the pocket. FORTUNA watches.]

FORTUNA

Guess that makes me solids.

[SAM lines up another shot and gets another ball into the pocket.]

FORTUNA

So, why do you need this luck so bad? Girlfriend problems? Liver failure?

SAM

Accursed by God.

[SAM lines up another shot but he misses.]

FORTUNA

Life’s a bitch, then you die.

DEAN

The God… literally cursed us.

FORTUNA

You’ve met?

DEAN

Yeah. Little guy, squirrelly as hell.

FORTUNA

Yeah, that’s him. Well, welcome to the club.

DEAN

The club?

FORTUNA

Yes, the club.

[She lines up a shot and gets a solid ball into the pocket.]

God created the world, but you know who created us gods? You did. You humans. Sort of.

[FORTUNA gets another solid ball into the pocket.]

FORTUNA

When you apes first climbed down from the trees, you didn’t pray to him. You prayed to the… the sun, the womb, the rain, and the stars. Well, at first, the creator was furious. How dare you not recognize his beneficence?

[She takes another shot and the ball rolls into the pocket.]

But soon enough, he birthed us… Ra, Anu, Hera, Mixcoatl, all the rest.

DEAN

Why?

FORTUNA

Why? [scoffs] Why?

[She takes another shot but the ball bounces off the corner and misses the pocket.]

FORTUNA

To take the blame. Bad harvest? Stillborn child? Our bad. Not his. Plus, we made for epic stories. But his ego could only handle that for so long. Now he’s happy to behind whatever religion has the best syndication deal. While we survive on scraps in the wilderness.

[SAM lines up a shot. He sinks the yellow ball into the pocket.]

FORTUNA

Most gods, they’re forgotten. But I’m old. I hold a grudge.

[SAM gets another ball into the pocket.]

FORTUNA

Oh well. What are you going to do?

DEAN

We’re gonna fight him.

FORTUNA

Are you, now? And when you lose…?

SAM

We lose swinging. Eight ball, corner pocket.

[SAM looks up at DEAN before he takes the shot. The eight ball falls into the corner pocket.]

FORTUNA

You little minx. You got me talking. You’re good.

SAM

I learned from my brother.

DEAN

Alright, you know the deal. Even up.

FORTUNA

What do you say we make it interesting? Okay? You’re gonna fight God. That’s the stuff of heroes, right? So, you’re gonna need the luck of heroes. Hercules, Cuchulain, Gilgamesh. I helped them all. I can help you, too.

SAM

What’s the catch?

FORTUNA

Another game. Double or nothing.

DEAN

Double. That’s how the cowboy died.

FORTUNA

Mm-hmm.

[EVIE walks forward into the room. SAM looks at her before he looks back at FORTUNA.]

SAM

Yeah. Deal. But not for more luck. For them. If I win, you have to let them go.

[He looks around at the other people in the bar.]

FORTUNA

Honey, I’m not stopping them.

SAM

Okay, then when I win, you have to give back the luck you stole. Close up shop.

FORTUNA

What is with you and these losers? They’re nothing! They don’t matter.

SAM

They matter to me.

DEAN

They matter to us.

[FORTUNA looks between DEAN and SAM.]

FORTUNA

Well, fine. Rack ‘em up.

[FORTUNA plays and gets all the coloured balls into the pockets. SAM and DEAN watch on. She turns to them.]

FORTUNA

Eight ball, corner pocket.

[She lines up the shot. She sinks the eight ball into the corner pocket.]

[DEAN shakes his head. Everyone in the bar looks at each other. FORTUNA turns to SAM and DEAN.]

FORTUNA

You challenged the Goddess of Luck in her own joint. What did you think was going to happen?

DEAN

Well, we had to try.

FORTUNA

Well, that was stupid.

[FORTUNA walks away.]

EXTERIOR – LURLENE’S – DAY

[SAM and DEAN walk out of the bar and over to the Impala.]

DEAN

Thought she was going to kill us.

SAM

Yeah, she doesn’t have to. Our luck will do that on its own. Dean, we can’t just…

DEAN

Just leave them. No. I know. Alright, well, let’s go find some Wi-Fi and see what kills Lady Luck. Then we’ll circle back.

[SAM looks towards the bar and sees EVIE walk out, followed by everyone else. They walk over to her.]

SAM

Hey. What… what’s going on? What happened?

EVIE

She… she shut it down.

SAM

What?

DEAN

Why?

EVIE

Because of you. She said she thought your kind had gone extinct.

SAM

Our kind?

EVIE

Heroes. Like the old days. And, uh, she gave me a message. She said, “Don’t play his game. Make him play yours.”

[EVIE holds out her hand. She holds a coin out to SAM. EVIE walks away. The green glow flows over SAM’s hand. DEAN picks it up and puts it in his hand. The glow flows over his hand.]

DEAN

Come on.

[They walk over to the Impala and get in. DEAN puts the keys in the ignition and starts the car. The engine revs.]

DEAN

We’re back, baby!

[DEAN closes the door and the Impala takes off down the highway.]

ACT FIVE
INTERIOR – BUNKER – DAY

[DEAN walks into the war room, scratching a card. SAM walks in behind him.]

DEAN

Alright, this is it. Last scratcher. Come on, come on.

[He blows on the card and frowns.]

DEAN

What the hell? I mean, so much for that “Luck of Hercules” crap.

SAM

So, we didn’t win the lottery. But no car trouble. Uh, credit cards work. Oh, and back-to-back bacon double cheeseburgers didn’t kill you, so…

DEAN

That was beautiful, by the way. I’m just saying would it have killed her to give us a little extra?

SAM

Well, she thinks we’re real heroes. Maybe they don’t get all the shortcuts.

DEAN

Friggin’ gods, man.

[SAM and DEAN walk into the library. CAS walks in from the opposite door.]

DEAN

Cas?

SAM

Hey. Everything okay?

[CAS steps aside. JACK walks out and raises his hand.]

JACK

Hello.

SAM

Jack?

CAS

It’s really him.

[SAM walks over and hugs JACK. He smiles as he steps away. DEAN walks over and places his hand on JACK’s neck. He looks into his eyes. He looks over at CAS who nods.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER – DAY

[SAM, DEAN, CAS and JACK sit around the map table, drinking beer.]

SAM

Jack, you… you ate their hearts?

JACK

I… I had to.

DEAN

And you let him?

[CAS nods.]

DEAN

Hmm.

SAM

You could’ve called us.

JACK

Every day I wanted to come home, but… I couldn’t.

DEAN

Why not?

JACK

Because if I don’t stay hidden, if I use my powers, my grandfather… he’ll know I’m back, and he’ll try and kill me… again. He’s afraid of me. And that’s why we had to wait.

CAS

Billie kept him hidden in the Empty until Chuck went off world.

JACK

She let me out when it was safe.

DEAN

Safe to what? Eat a bunch of angel hearts?

JACK

Safe to do what I have to. The hearts, they were just the beginning. They made me strong, but I-I’m not strong enough. I… If I do exactly what she says, if I follow her plan, then I’ll get stronger and… I’ll be able to kill God.

[SAM and DEAN look at each other before DEAN looks back at JACK.]
