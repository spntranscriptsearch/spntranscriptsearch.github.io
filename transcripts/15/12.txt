INTERIOR – RADIO SHED – DAY

Four Weeks Ago – Earth 2

[A woman walks around the store, looking at the speakers displayed. Pop Tart Heart by Louden Swain plays on the radio. RADIO SHED CLERK smiles at her and she smiles back.]

RADIO ANNOUNCER

You’re listening to Jimmy Jack and the Ros, traffic and weather together, after the news. Take it, Ros.

RADIO ANNOUCER 2

Thanks, Jimmy Jack. Negotiations resume at the U.N. today as world leaders work to restore the Paris Agreement. The revamped agreement would represent an historic victory in the fight against climate change.

[RADIO SHED CLERK continues to smile at the WOMAN. She frowns and leaves the store.]

RADIO SHED CLERK

Come again.

RADIO ANNOUNCER 2

In other news, President Hillary Clinton is in Iowa, as she officially kicks off her re-election campaign…

[RADIO SHED CLERK turns off the radio. The bell on the shop door rings. CHUCK enters the shop.]

RADIO SHED CLERK

Hello, sir! Welcome to Radio Shed, “where superstore inventory meets swap-meet prices!” Oh, um… I take it you’re unsatisfied with your viewing experience at home?

[CHUCK walks over to the display of TVs.]

CHUCK

You have no idea.

RADIO SHED CLERK

Okay. Well, we’ve got everything the big-box stores have… 4K, 8K, HD, LED, OLED, HDMI 2.1. 48-, 55-, and 65-inch, freestanding or wall-mounted. And to bring it all together this universal remote… a Radio Shed exclusive.

[RADIO SHED CLERK takes out a remote from his back pocket, as CHUCK turns away from the TVs to face him.]


CHUCK

Sorry. Not really what I’m looking for.

RADIO SHED CLERK

Oh? Uh, then, what are you looking for?

CHUCK

An audience.

RADIO SHED CLERK

An audience?

CHUCK

It’s monologue time.

[CHUCK raises his hands and the TVs start to display all the alternate versions of Earth. RADIO SHED CLERK looks between the remote and TVs in confusion.]

CHUCK

In the beginning, it was just me and sis. And it was fine. But I wasn’t satisfied. So I made more. I created the world.

[One TV switches to DEAN and CAS talking in the bunker’s kitchen.]

CHUCK

But I didn’t stop there. No, no, no. I got the bug! So, I… I kept creating. I made… other worlds.

[The TVs start to change to the alternate versions of SAM and DEAN.]

CHUCK

Different combinations, scenarios, characters. Different versions of the same characters. You know, “my other toys”. Is that where I screwed up?

RADIO SHED CLERK

Sir, this is a Radio Shed.

CHUCK

Dean says I’m not gonna get the ending I want. I don’t know. Maybe I… I… I mean, that shouldn’t matter, right? I’ve gotten what I want from hundreds of Sam’s and Dean’s. I could get what I want from a hundred more. And I don’t care. Those other toys, they don’t… they don’t… spark joy. But Sam and Dean… the real Sam and Dean… they do.

[CHUCK continues to watch DEAN, CAS and now SAM in the bunker’s kitchen.]

CHUCK

They challenge me… they disappoint me… they surprise me. They’re… the ones.

RADIO SHED CLERK

How about a stereo?

CHUCK

I don’t need more!

RADIO SHED CLERK

Okay.

CHUCK

More things, more distractions? I need less. It’s time to clear the board.

[CHUCK waves his hand and all the TVs go back to the Radio Shed logo.]

CHUCK

All the other worlds, alternate realities, the subplots… the failed spin-offs… it’s time to start cancelling shows.

ACT ONE

EXTERIOR – SIOUX FALLS – NIGHT

Sioux Falls. Our World. Now.

[Lights of a police car flash. JODY stands over a dead cow, looking at the blood with a flashlight.]

JODY

Oh, yikes.

[Her phone rings and she stands up to answer it, moving away from the cow.]

JODY

Oh. Hey, Alex.

ALEX

Lasagne’s getting cold.

JODY

Yeah. Who made it… you or Patience?

ALEX

I did. It’s vegan.

JODY

You know, actually, tonight, I’m grateful for that. I assumed we had a monster on our hands, but it’s looking like human-on-animal cruelty. Poor Bessie was clubbed to death.

ALEX

That’s sick.

JODY

Yeah. Keep the lasagne in the oven.

ALEX

Will do.

[JODY ends the call. She turns towards the barn and sees a hooded figure run inside.]

INTERIOR – BARN – NIGHT

[JODY enters the barn with her gun raised and flashlight on. She walks around, shining her flashlight over everything inside.]

JODY

Hello?

[JODY sees nothing in the barn. She puts her flashlight down, just as something jumps down behind her. She turns and is knocked out by the hooded person.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[SAM and CAS stand in front of DEAN, who sits at the table with a beer in front of him.]

SAM

I still don’t like it.

DEAN

Which part… Jack’s deal with Death? Or the part where she’s got him eating Angel hearts?

CAS

Ugh. The hearts were disturbing.

SAM

So, what’s next? We’re just supposed to trust her?

DEAN

Well, apparently Billie’s got Jack on a need-to-know, which not a shock. We’ve made deals with cosmic players before… “cards up” ain’t their style.

SAM

Jack still doesn’t have a soul. And now he’s been in the Empty for months. I mean, we have no idea where his head is right now.

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[JACK walks past the table and looks at the initials carved into it. He runs his fingers over “MW.”]

INTERIOR – JACK’S ROOM – NIGHT

[JACK walks into his room and runs his hand over his backpack. He turns around and walks over to the mirror cabinet. He closes the mirror and sees someone standing him, MERLE the reaper.]

MERLE

You rang?

JACK

I don’t understand.

MERLE

You made a silent prayer to Death. She’s got her hands full at the moment, so she sent me. What’s up, kid?

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[CAS stands in front of DEAN.]

CAS

Well, I have my concerns, but… Jack trusts Billie, and I trust Jack.

SAM

But what about cosmic balance, Cas? I mean, Jack’s gonna kill God? What about Amara?

[DEAN stands up from the table and picks up his beer.]

DEAN

I don’t know. I don’t know. But I have seen Billie’s library, and I have spent time with her. I… Well, “trust” is a strong word, but… I believe in her. There’s no one more committed to the rules than she is. She’s probably got it all figured out.

SAM

Probably? Like she had the Mal’ak box figured out?

DEAN

Yeah, I dunno. I mean, she’s still Death. She was right about Rowena.

SAM

All I’m saying is, I wish we knew more.

DEAN

Yeah, I got questions too, but right now this is the only plan we got.

SAM

Right.

[SAM leaves the kitchen.]

INTERIOR – JACK’S ROOM – NIGHT

[JACK turns away from the mirror to face MERLE.]

JACK

When the Grigori trapped me, I called out for her, but… She didn’t come then, either.

MERLE

She musta known you’d handle it.

JACK

But… I didn’t. Cas saved me.

MERLE

She musta known that, too. Relax. Just follow the rules. Lie low. Wait for instructions. And don’t use your powers under any circumstances, ‘cause…?

JACK

If I do, God might find me.

MERLE

Mm-hmm.

INTERIOR – BUNKER HALLWAY – NIGHT

[SAM walks down the hallway and hears JACK talking in his room. He stops in front of the closed door.]


JACK

Okay. I’ll do it. Everything she asks.

INTERIOR – JACK’S ROOM – NIGHT

[SAM knocks on the door.]

SAM

Jack?

[SAM opens the door and walks in.]

SAM

Hey.

JACK

Hey.

SAM

Uh, who were you talking to?

JACK

Uh, no one.

SAM

Hey, uh, I-I just, uh… wanted to check in on you, make sure you’re settling in okay.

JACK

I am.

SAM

Good. Good. We’re all just, uh… We’re just… We’re so glad to have you back. You know that, right? And… And you know that… you could’ve come to us first, Jack. We would’ve helped you.

JACK

I know.

[SAM nods and leaves the room.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[DEAN and CAS sit in the chairs, each with a glass of whiskey in their hands.]

CAS

I knew it, Dean. When I was with Jack’s mother, she… You know, Kelly just had faith that Jack would be good for the world, and I felt it, too. I knew it. And then, when everything went wrong, and God took him from us… I was lost in a way I’ve never been before. Because I knew the story wasn’t over. I knew Jack wasn’t done. And I was right.

DEAN

Well, here’s to being right.

[DEAN holds up his glass and CAS clinks his glass against DEAN’s.]

DEAN

And here’s to payback. Hmm? Come on. What, revenge doesn’t sound good to you?

CAS

What sounds good to me is Jack fulfilling his destiny.

DEAN

Okay, yeah, but… icing on the cake? I mean, Chuck wanted Cain and Abel, and… now we’re going all Biblical on him. Killed by his own grandson. That sounds right to me.

[DEAN’s phone rings. JODY is calling. He answers it and puts it on speaker phone.]

DEAN

Heya, Jody.

JODY

Dean, I’m in trouble. Route 11.

INTERIOR – BARN – NIGHT

[JODY is tied to a chair. A gloved hand holds her phone in front of her.]

JODY

Fletcher farm, the old barn. If you don’t come, I’m dead.

[The gloved hand ends the call.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER – NIGHT

[DEAN looks down at his phone.]

DEAN

Jody?

[The call ends. DEAN and CAS look at each other.]

ACT TWO

EXTERIOR – BARN – DAY

[The Impala pulls up outside the barn, next to JODY’s sheriff’s car. SAM is talking on the phone.]

SAM

She’s gonna be fine. Just hang tight, okay? Bye.

[He hangs up. SAM and DEAN take out their guns as they look over JODY’s car.]

INTERIOR – BARN – DAY

[DEAN walks in first, his gun raised. SAM follows behind him. He sees JODY tied to a chair, a gag tied around her mouth.]

SAM

Jody.

[SAM and DEAN walk over to her. SAM starts to untie her and takes her gag off.]

SAM

Hey. You alright?

JODY

Uh-huh.

SAM

Okay.

[JODY takes her hands out from the ties and sees someone behind SAM.]

JODY

Look out!

[DARK KAIA attacks SAM. She hits him and then DEAN with her rod and puts DEAN into a chokehold.]

DARK KAIA

You have something that belongs to me.

DEAN

What, the spear? Oh, that got broke.

DARK KAIA

You promised you’d get me back to my world.

DEAN

Well, the way I see it, that promise expired the minute you hurt our friend.

[JODY breaks the chair over DARK KAIA’s back. She falls to the floor. DEAN gets up and takes out his gun, pointing it at DARK KAIA. SAM also points his gun at her.]

DEAN

Alright, whatever this is, it’s over.

DARK KAIA

You promised. You said the boy could get me home.

DEAN

Well, the boy’s off limits.

SAM

I don’t get it. Why? Why go back to that Hellhole? Why now?

DARK KAIA

Because… my world is dying.

SAM

Your world is dying?

[DARK KAIA stands up from the floor.]

DARK KAIA

Yes.

SAM

How do you know that?

DARK KAIA

From my dreams.

DEAN

Who you got eyes on over there? When you gave me the spear, you said that there was someone, someone you were protecting.

DARK KAIA

Her.

EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE - NIGHT

[Flashback to 13.10 Wayward Sisters. KAIA lies dead on the floor of the Bad Place. DARK KAIA stands over her.]

INTERIOR – BARN – DAY

[The boys are still pointing their guns at DARK KAIA.]

DARK KAIA

We share our memories, our lives, our dreams. Even when I came here it never stopped.

JODY

Kaia?

DARK KAIA

We’ve been connected my whole life. Born at the same time in different worlds.

JODY

Yeah, but you killed her. She’s dead!

DARK KAIA

I never meant to hurt… her.

EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT

[A flashback shows DARK KAIA heal KAIA.]

DARK KAIA

I thought I could leave her behind, but… she haunts me.

INTERIOR – BARN – DAY

[DARK KAIA steps forward.]

DARK KAIA

Kaia’s alive.

JODY

Oh, my God.

DEAN

What?

EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT

[A flashback shows KAIA waking up in a hut.]

INTERIOR – BARN – DAY

[JODY stands between SAM and DEAN.]

JODY

She’s been stuck over there this whole time? We left her there for dead!

DARK KAIA

I left her the tools she needed to survive. And she has. But… my world is ending, and… I can see it through her eyes.

INTERIOR – KAIA’S HUT – NIGHT

[KAIA picks up a bowl of food, as she sits in front of a fire and sings to herself.]

KAIA

Miss Mary Mack, all dressed in black, black, black, with silver buttons, buttons, buttons, all down her back, back, back.

[Thunder cracks above her. She walks out of the hut to see the dark skies and lightning flashing, as the wind picks up speed.]

INTERIOR – BARN – DAY

[DEAN raises his gun again and points it at DARK KAIA.]

DARK KAIA

I need to get back there. That’s why I need your help.

[JODY looks between SAM and DEAN.]

ACT THREE

INTERIOR – BUNKER WAR ROOM – NIGHT

[CAS and JACK sit at the map table and play Connect Four. JACK drops his black coin in. CAS bangs his fist on the table.]

CAS

You have four of the same color connected, so… given the name of the game, I assume that means you’ve won.

[The door to the Bunker opens. CAS and JACK look up.]

JACK

They’re back.

[SAM walks down first, with JODY behind him.]

CAS

Jody?

JODY

Hey, Jack, Cas.

CAS

Nice to finally meet you in person. So, what happened?

[DEAN walks down the stairs, holding DARK KAIA by her shoulders.]

DEAN

Long story.

[DARK KAIA and JACK look at each other.]

DARK KAIA

Hello, Jack.

INTERIOR – BUNKER WAR ROOM – NIGHT

[SAM, DEAN, CAS, JACK AND JODY stand in circle. They face away from DARK KAIA.]

CAS

Jack can’t help her.

SAM

Yeah, we know that, Cas.

DEAN

I already told her he’s off-limits.

SAM

We’ll find another way… we have to. I mean, Kaia is there because of us.

DEAN

Alright, so you and me, we’ll hit the lore.

SAM

Yeah. Cas, why don’t you and Jody dig through our stores? We might have something in the inventory we haven’t thought of yet, something that can help us jump worlds.

CAS

I’ll call Sergei, as well. He may have more archangel grace. Other than Jack, it’s the only thing that’s worked for us before.

SAM

Yeah, good idea.

DARK KAIA

We’re running out of time.

[They all turn to face her.]

DARK KAIA

He’s standing right there. He could bring us there now.

DEAN

Hey, Not Kaia… not helping.

JACK

I can help in other ways. Research.

DEAN

Sure. Meantime, what are we gonna do with her?

[JODY walks towards DARK KAIA.]

JODY

Well, she killed a priced heifer just to get my attention, then she jumped me, beat me up, and threatened to kill me. Do I get a vote?

[DARK KAIA glares at JODY.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[DARK KAIA is chained to the table. A magazine is open in front of her. She pushes it away from her.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[JACK is looking through large books. He opens one and looks through it. He stands up and walks over to SAM and DEAN, who sit at the table with their own research.]

JACK

Guys, what about this? La Piegatrice Mondiale. It’s an old Italian spell… Stregherian magic. It means “The World Bender.”

DEAN

What’re the ingredients?

JACK

Basic stuff… crystals, herbs, and the, uh… “liver of a mandragora.”

[SAM and DEAN scoff.]

JACK

What? What’s that? Some kind of monster?

DEAN

Yeah, one that’s extinct.

SAM

Our dad wrote about it in his journal. “A hunt in Fargo”… killed the last one.

DEAN

Hey, why don’t you go see if Cas and Jody are having any luck?

[JACK nods and closes the book. He leaves the library.]

DEAN

We’re not finding anything.

SAM

I know.

DEAN

I mean, nothing that doesn’t require archangel grace, which we don’t have. And Michael didn’t exactly leave a forwarding address.

SAM

Listen, I can try and jerry-rig up some magic using a substitute. But then again, the only substitute we have that would even stand a chance of working is…

DEAN

Nephilim grace.

SAM

Yeah. And I’m guessing that would be against Billie’s rules. So…


DEAN

We’re batting zero.

INTERIOR – BUNKER STORE ROOM – NIGHT

[JODY looks through all the bottles and artefacts on the table. CAS is on the phone.]

CAS

Sergei. Hello? It’s Castiel. Call me back as soon as you can? I-I have a question for you.

[CAS ends the voicemail.]

JODY

No luck with your friend?

CAS

Well, Sergei is hardly a friend. But no, he’s not picking up. You find anything?

JODY

Uh, well, there’s a handful of unidentified objects in the inventory, but the thing about magical items is that they are not on the web. We could go analogue, check all the books, but that could take months.

CAS

You tell Claire?

[JODY turns around to face CAS.]

JODY

She’s out of cell range. She’s deep in Yosemite. Believe it or not, she’s following up a lead on a woman in a dark cloak.

CAS

Apparently, a false lead.

JODY

Claire has spent years looking for… revenge. She loved her… Kaia. Claire would do anything for a chance to save her, but there’s just… there’s no time to loop her in, and if we fail…

CAS

She’d never recover.

JODY

It’d kill her.

[JODY turns back to the table and starts looking through books. CAS dials a number.]

CAS

Sergei, you better not be ignoring my calls. Call me back.

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[DARK KAIA is still chained to the table. JACK walks in.]

JACK

Hello.

DARK KAIA

What do you want?

JACK

I’m sorry. It’s just… you look just like her. And… H-How did you come…

DARK KAIA

I don’t know. You have anything else you want to say, “off-limits” boy?

JACK

I’m sorry I can’t do more.

DARK KAIA

I saw you. You encouraged her. She was scared, and you pushed her to cross over.

JACK

I… I wanted to help her. She was in so much pain.

DARK KAIA

She’s in pain now. And soon, she will die.

JACK

Because of me.

[JACK walks over to the table and sits down next to DARK KAIA.]

JACK

Why? Why did you do it? Come here?


DARK KAIA

I envied her. Her world looked peaceful. This place is… cold. I don’t understand it. I don’t know how to move through it. So, I just find empty spaces, and I hide. This world doesn’t want me. And I’m done with it.

[DARK KAIA reaches over and grabs JACK’s hands. He struggles against her hold.]

DARK KAIA

We can fix this. You can help us. Please? Please.

[DARK KAIA lets go of JACK’s hands. He looks at her before he lifts his hands to her temples. His eyes start to glow. DARK KAIA’s eyes also glow as JACK uses his powers on her.]

INTERIOR – KAIA’S HUT – NIGHT

[KAIA sits in front of the fire inside her hut.]

KAIA

Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack, all dressed in black, black, black…

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[JACK takes his hands away from DARK KAIA’s forehead. They look at each other.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[JACK walks into the library. SAM and DEAN still have research in front of them.]

JACK

I’m saving Kaia.

SAM

What?

JACK

I owe it to her. She’s running out of time… I saw it.

SAM

What, you… how? No, wait a second. Did you dream walk?

DEAN

Whoa, wait. What?

SAM

Jack, what about Billie’s plan?

JACK

I know, I know, but… saving Kaia, it’s the right thing to do.

MERLE

You’ve got to be kidding me.

[JACK turns around to face MERLE as she walks into the library. SAM and DEAN stand up from the table.]

DEAN

Who the hell are you?

MERLE

Name’s Merle.

JACK

She’s a reaper… works with Billie.

DEAN

How’d you get in here?

MERLE

Piggybacked on the boy.

JACK

She’s been watching me.

MERLE

Yeah, I’ve been watching you screw up. One measly life on the line, and you’re ready to risk it all? That’s not just dumb. That’s Winchester dumb.

DEAN

Hey!

JACK

I’m the only one who can do this.

MERLE

Well, try, and I’ll tell Death.

[JACK and MERLE look at each other.]

JACK

Okay.

MERLE

Mm.

[JACK looks at SAM and DEAN who look back him, confused. JACK turns back to MERLE.]

JACK

Go. In the meantime, I’ll open a rift to the Bad Place. I’m sure Billie will appreciate hearing about it after the fact when it’s already too late.

MERLE

Okay. And how about I just stop you? Right now.

JACK

You can try. Run to Billie. Tell her everything went sideways on your watch, and she how she reacts… what she decides to do to you. Or help us. Help us find the safest, smartest way to pull this off, and she never has to know.

MERLE

Now… this is Winchester stupid.

DEAN

But?

MERLE

But there might be a way. The, uh… cosmic warding that Amara peeled off these walls that somehow, you’ve all been too stupid to even try and repair…

DEAN

Uh, we fixed that.

MERLE

Oh, you fixed part of it. You slapped up some anti-demonic monster warding. You didn’t come close to restoring the original, cosmic-grade stuff.

SAM

Okay. Then how do we restore it?

MERLE

Well, you can’t… not permanently. But I know how to get it back up… for a while. But it won’t be enough. This good-enough warding, I’m gonna have to juice it up, feed it. I’m gonna need to borrow your angel.

DEAN

And with all that, you think that’ll keep us off of Chuck’s radar?

MERLE

Better hope so.

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[CAS walks into the library, followed by JACK. CAS hands DEAN a bottle of an ingredient. DEAN drops some of it into a bowl. SAM takes a spell book from JODY.]

SAM

Magia, quae olim inhaeserat in his symbolis, nunc depletes, reducatur, reducatur.

[The bowl starts to glow. Slowly, the invisible warding starts to illuminate around the arches, pillars and walls of the bunker. MERLE puts down a large rock with symbols on it on the table. SAM loads his handgun as he helps DEAN with the backpack.]

DEAN

How you feeling ‘bout this?

SAM

Honestly? Feels like we’re taking a big, probably stupid risk. Feels good. Disobeying cosmic entities, doing the, uh… dumb, right thing? Feels like we’re back.

[SAM takes out a shotgun and cocks it. JACK opens the chains around DARK KAIA’s hands and legs. JODY walks into the library with her duffle bag and places it on one of the tables. CAS walks up to her.]

JODY

Hey, thanks for staying, keep an eye on the reaper.

CAS

Yeah. Um… Jody, I-I’d… I’d like to ask you to stay, as well.

JODY

What is that? Some kind of B.S. male chivalry thing?

CAS

No. No, it’s not. Jody, it’s, um… Well, you know… I was never able to make things right with Claire, what I took from her. I mean… I’m never gonna be able to make that right. But… you and Claire found each other, and she has you now. If something goes wrong with this rescue, and… and Kaia isn’t saved… Claire will be devastated, but she’ll survive. She already has. But if she loses you both…

JODY

That’d kill her.

CAS

Yeah.

MERLE

Castiel? Ready when you are.

[CAS looks at MERLE. He looks back JODY. JODY sighs and nods.]

CAS

Thanks.

[CAS walks over to the table and stands next to MERLE. They place their hands on the rock, over the symbols. It starts to glow, just as the warding begins to glow as well.]

DEAN

Alright, Jack. You’re up.

[JACK lifts his arm and his eyes start to glow. A glowing rift appears in the middle of the empty space in the room. DARK KAIA walks around them and looks at it. She passes through the rift. SAM looks at DEAN and DEAN nods at him. SAM passes through the rift, followed by DEAN.]

EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT

[DARK KAIA stands and watches her world, as SAM and DEAN pass through the rift behind her.]

DEAN

How’s it feel to be back?

[DARK KAIA says nothing as she continues to look around.]

DEAN

Good talk.

SAM

Okay. Where is she?

[DARK KAIA starts to walk through the forest. The boys follow her. DARK KAIA suddenly stops, and holds her hand up for them to stop.]

SAM

What?

[They hear rustling in the trees. SAM and DEAN raise their guns. They are surrounded by Canids.]

DEAN

Aw, crap.

ACT FOUR

EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT

[DARK KAIA, SAM and DEAN are surrounded by Canids.]

SAM

Do we fight ‘em?

DARK KAIA

No. This many? You’d lose.

DEAN

Well, they seem hungry.

DARK KAIA

They’re not hungry. They’re scared.

DEAN

Scared of what? You?

DARK KAIA

No. This.

[DARK KAIA points at the sky. Thunder cracks and lightning flashes, as the wind picks up speed. The Canids run away.]

DARK KAIA

Let’s go.

[DARK KAIA walks ahead of SAM and DEAN.]

INTERIOR – KAIA’S HUT – NIGHT

[KAIA hides as the weather of the Bad Place worsens.]

EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT

[DARK KAIA sees the hut and stops.]

DEAN

What is that?

DARK KAIA

My home.

SAM

Kaia!

DEAN

Kaia!

[They start to walk closer.]

INTERIOR – KAIA’S HUT – NIGHT

[KAIA hears their voices. She picks up her knife and leaves the hut.]

EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN continue to look around. KAIA walks out of the hut and sees the boys. DEAN walks up to her.]

DEAN

Hey, kid.

[KAIA and DEAN hug. KAIA sees DARK KAIA over DEAN’s shoulder and pulls away from him.]

SAM

No, Kaia, it’s okay. She helped us find you.

DEAN

We should go.

[DEAN and KAIA start to leave, as SAM follows behind them. DARK KAIA stands back and watches them leave. The boys stop and turn back.]

DEAN

Come on!

DARK KAIA

No, I’m staying!

SAM

What?

DARK KAIA

This is my home. I never should’ve left it.

SAM

You’ll die.

DARK KAIA

I don’t belong in your world. You do. Go.

[KAIA looks at DARK KAIA.]

DARK KAIA

GO!

DEAN

Come on!

[DEAN takes KAIA’s shoulder and leads her back to the rift. SAM runs behind them. The skies darken as the thunder and lightning continue harshly. Large clouds fall over the forest, as the skies become black. DARK KAIA closes her eyes as her world is enveloped by darkness.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[JODY sits next to the rift, waiting. SAM passes through first, followed by DEAN who holds KAIA. The rift closes. KAIA looks at JODY.]

JODY

Kaia.

[JODY walks over to KAIA. They hug.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER WAR ROOM – NIGHT

[JACK paces around the room. He stops and sees KAIA walk in, dressed in his clothes.]

JACK

Told you they’d fit. They do, uh… kind of.

KAIA

They’re clean.


JACK

How’d you survive alone… all that time?

KAIA

Miss Mary Mack.

[JACK looks confused.]

KAIA

The nursery rhyme. My mom used to… Um, doesn’t matter.

[JODY walks into the war room. She smiles at JACK and stands in front of KAIA.]

KAIA

So… what do I do now?

JODY

Well, uh, if you want, come back to Sioux Falls, my home.

KAIA

Will Claire be there?

JODY

She will be. Soon.

[KAIA smiles, tearfully. She looks at SAM and DEAN.]

KAIA

Thank you.

[The boys smile and nod. KAIA walks towards the stairs, as JODY follows. She turns and smiles at the boys, before she walks up the stairs behind KAIA. KAIA waves at them as she leaves.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN walk into the room, followed by CAS and JACK. MERLE stands in the middle of the room.]

MERLE

If I cared for a second about saving that girl, I guess I’d say that was a victory.

SAM

So, you think the warding worked? Kept us off Chuck’s radar?

MERLE

If it hadn’t, we would all be dead, so I’d say, yeah, it worked.

[A Scythe pierces through MERLE’s neck. She crumbles to ash. The boys look shocked as BILLIE appears.]

BILLIE

Hello, boys.

ACT FIVE

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[DEAN looks at BILLIE, shocked.]

DEAN

What the hell?

[BILLIE looks at him before she looks over at JACK. She moves through SAM and DEAN and walks toward him.]

BILLIE

Bending the rules already, Jack?

JACK

Billie… I tried to call you.

BILLIE

I know. I was busy. Can’t say I’m not disappointed, though.

DEAN

Disappointed? You just iced one of your reapers.

BILLIE

Merle had one job… keep you in line. She failed. We’re playing a big game here, and we’re only as strong as our weakest players. She had to go. That’s the difference between you and me. I see the big picture. I understand that one life means nothing in the grand scheme. That girl you saved from a dying world; you think hers was the only one? They’re all dying. All the worlds… each and every world… but this one.

CAS

It’s Chuck.


BILLIE

Mm-hmm. He’s been a busy boy… extinguishing galaxies. Wiping the slate clean… for the end.

SAM

Yeah, and what’s your endgame, Billie? I mean, you lecture us about how important all this is, but we don’t even know what you’re doing. Jack’s gonna kill God, right? Yeah? Great. Okay. How? What’s your plan?

BILLIE

When I was a reaper, I believed in the rules. But then you killed me.

[BILLIE looks at CAS.]

BILLIE

And when I became Death, I inherited Death’s knowledge… and Death’s library. And in Death’s library, everyone has a book. Even God.

DEAN

So God can die.

BILLIE

Everything dies.

[Flashback to 5.21 Two Minutes to Midnight. DEATH sits with DEAN in the diner.]

DEATH

In the end, I’ll reap him, too.

DEAN

God? You’ll reap God?

DEATH

Oh, yes.

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[BILLIE turns to CAS.]

CAS

I don’t understand. Why would God write the blueprint to his own death?

BILLIE

He didn’t. The books write themselves.

[BILLIE turns back to SAM and DEAN.

BILLIE

After God made the world, he couldn’t stop. He wanted more. But he needed to create a perfect harmony… a Swiss watch, so this world could keep tick, tick, ticking in his absence. He had no choice but to build himself into the framework. It’s his only weakness.

DEAN

So, Chuck doesn’t know what’s inside the book?

BILLIE

No one can read their books unless I let them.

SAM

What about Jack? He’s in God’s book?

BILLIE

And so are you.

[BILLIE looks at DEAN.]

BILLIE

I told you, Dean. You and your brother have work to do. This is your destiny. You are the messengers of God’s destruction.

[SAM and DEAN look at BILLIE.]

INTERIOR – RADIO SHED – DAY

[The TVs are on, showing all the other worlds being destroyed. CHUCK watches from a chair, as he eats fries. He picks up his drink and stands up, stretching. He starts to walk away. The RADIO SHED CLERK is sleeping on the floor in a pile of food wrappers. He wakes up, looking unclean.]

RADIO SHED CLERK

Are you finished, sir? Is that all of them?

CHUCK

Nah. Not yet. You know, unwinding whole worlds, some take a snap, but others are more complex. They’ll need more time. Attention.

[CHUCK starts to leave but stops.]

RADIO SHED CLERK

But you’ll spare us, though… right? I mean, I’ve served you for weeks. I’ll be okay, right?

[CHUCK smiles and walks up to him. He places his hand on RADIO SHED CLERK’s cheek.]

CHUCK

You’ll be fine. Everything’s just fine.

[RADIO SHED CLERK smiles. He places his hand on his cheek where CHUCK touched it.]

EXTERIOR – RADIO SHED – DAY

[CHUCK walks out of the store with a smirk on his face. He slurps the last of his drink, shakes it and tosses it over his shoulder. As he walks away, meteors fly through the sky, landing on the Radio Shed building.]
