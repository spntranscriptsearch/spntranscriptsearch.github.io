TEASER
In the bunker kitchen, water is slowly dripping out of the faucet. The lights suddenly flicker. Then there is a shot of the empty dungeon and the one overhead light is also flickering. A shot of the long hallway reveals a faint flickering apparition. Then the map table in the main room flickers. The camera walks down the hall with a ghostly sound following. It pans up to a grate in a door and we see into DEAN's room. DEAN is lying on his bed, eyes closed, with headphones on. As the camera moves to a close up of his face the music playing in the headphones suddenly turns to static. DEAN's eyes fly open.


From the hallway, we hear DEAN shout for his brother.


DEAN

Sam!


SAM [bolting out of his bedroom]

Dean?

[He rushs to DEAN's bedroom but sees that it is empty. The lights in the whole bunker continue to flicker.]

Dean?

[SAM rushes to the main room and sees one of the chairs spinning on its own. SAM grabs a iron sword from the wall and we see the apparition slowly walking behind him. Before SAM can swing around the apparition is blown to bits. SAM whips around and DEAN stands there with a smoking shotgun.]


SAM

So...


DEAN

Yep. Bunker's haunted.


TITLE CARD


ACT ONE
[Scene opens with SAM packing rock salt rounds at the kitchen table. DEAN enters]


DEAN

How is this possible? I thought you said this was the safest place on the planet.


SAM

Look, I know nothing got in. I mean, the bunker is warded and sigiled from top to bottom. There's no way something came in from the outside.


DEAN

Okay, so whoever's haunting us died here.


SAM

What, dead man of letters?


DEAN

No, that doesn't track. I mean, we're the first people to occupy this place in 50 years. Why would a ghost wait so long to get its spook on?


SAM

Must have been a more recent death.


DEAN

No.


SAM

How can you be so sure?


DEAN

Because I burned his body myself, okay? It's not him.


SAM

Okay, so you cremated him. We cremated Bobby, too, and he came back.


DEAN

Sam, I'm telling you -- this ghost, it's not Kevin.


[Suddenly the coffeemaker next to DEAN starts going crazy with lights flashing on and off and the digital clock speeding through different numbers. DEAN and SAM stare at it.]


SAM [speaking to the coffeemaker]

Kevin?


[A coffee mug next to the machine explodes.]


DEAN

Ooh.


[Scene changes to a shot of an outdoor funeral. The priest is talking.]


PRIEST

We commit her body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, with a clear and certain hope of resurrection into the eternal life, according to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue

all things unto himself. In ne patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti.


[A man walks away and the camera follows him as the PRIEST continues.]


Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, Lord.


[The man is suddenly grabbed and shoved into a tree by CASTIEL]


CASTIEL

What are you doing here?


MAN

Please, she was my friend!


CASTIEL

Who? The dead human or the angel who was killed while possessing her?


MAN

The angel. Rebecca?


CASTIEL

Rebecca had a lot of friends. Friends like Metatron. Where is he?!


MAN

You're looking in the wrong place. Rebecca and Metatron were friends. That was a long time ago. Had no contact since the fall. Naomi, Metatron, heavenly battles, politics -- she gave it up. All of it. Rebecca taught us the angels have lost touch with our true mission.


CASTIEL

What do you mean by "us"?


MAN

The penitents. Her followers.


CASTIEL

Another faction.


MAN

Not like the others. We don't make war. We live humbly among these humans. Or we did. He killed all the others. And he killed her.


CASTIEL

Who did?


MAN

Who else? The monster. Bartholomew.


[Back in the bunker kitchen, SAM is keeping vigil over the coffeemaker. DEAN enters.]


DEAN

Anything?


SAM

Eh, a couple of dings. A little EMF activity, but mostly...silence.


DEAN

So, he's back in the veil.


SAM

I guess so. Fumbling to break through. I mean, you got to figure it took Bobby months to make contact.


DEAN

Kevin's only... He's new at this.


SAM

Right. [He gets up from the table] All right, you're up.


[As SAM leaves the room, DEAN sits down and sits his head in his hand and stares at the coffeemaker.]


DEAN

Kevin? Kevin. All right, I can't do this. Coffee-buzzing, bump-in-the-night crap. I got serious things to say to you, okay? And I'm not gonna say them to this.

[DEAN gets up and turns his back on the coffeemaker]

Kevin, I'm sorry. You did not choose this life. You busted your ass, you lost everything, everyone you've loved... And your reward? Getting killed... On my watch. If I... It was on me. It was my fault, and...


[DEAN closes his eyes and tries to keep his emotions under control. But the lights start to flicker behind him.]


DEAN

And there's nothing I can do to make that right. I am so sorry.


SAM [rushing back into the kitchen]

Hey, did you see that? The -- the lights were...


[SAM stops and he sees across the room, the ghostly apparition finally starts to take shape. It is KEVIN TRAN muttering to himself.]


KEVIN

No, this is not happening. Didn't spend months struggling to break through the veil just to get stuck listening to Dean Winchester having a self-pity session. Didn't hear enough of those when I was alive.


DEAN [staring at him]

Kevin?


KEVIN

You can see me?


SAM

Hey, take it easy, Kevin. You might not hold this form for too long, okay? I-it takes a while.


KEVIN

Then we should talk fast.


DEAN

Wait, wait, wait. Why aren't you in -- in heaven? I mean, if anybody deserves an express pass to paradise --


KEVIN [still momentarily flickering in and out]

I couldn't. I can't. No one can. Heaven's closed for business. Everyone who's died since the angels fell are just stuck inside the veil, waiting. And it's bad in here. Like DMV-line-times-infinity bad.


SAM

Well, I mean, what can we do?


KEVIN

I need a favor -- big one.


SAM

Okay.


KEVIN

Find my mother.


SAM

Kevin.


DEAN

Crowley only told you she was alive to mess with you.


KEVIN

I'm not going off his word. All right? I have my own sources. It's crowded in the veil. All of us are stuck near the sites of our deaths. But I've been able to pass messages spirit to spirit. I made contact with another new arrival. She said she saw my mom just a week ago, alive.


DEAN

Okay, this -- this spirit that you're playing ghost telephone with, I mean, what do you even know about her?


KEVIN

Her name's Candy. Says she's in a forest in Wichita.


DEAN

Candy?


SAM

That's it? That's all you got?


KEVIN

Long-distance communication within the veil -- it's not ideal. That's why I need you to go there, summon her, see what else she knows. You say you want to make it right? This is how.


[KEVIN flicks away]


[CASTIEL is walking out of the cemetery but it met with two angels with their blades drawn.]


ANGEL #1

Where did your friend go in such a hurry?


CASTIEL

You're too late. He's gone.


ANGEL #1

Castiel?


ANGEL #2

Our boss has been looking for you.


ACT TWO
[Scene opens with SAM and DEAN walking through the woods by a train trestle.]


SAM

All right, that's the trestle. Candy said her spirit was stuck nearby.


DEAN

She died here?


SAM

Yeah.


DEAN

Dude, what got her? A bear?


SAM

I'm still stuck on the fact that we're trying to summon a ghost named Candy. You know, just 'cause Kevin said he heard his mom is alive doesn't mean she --


DEAN

Hey, we at least owe it to the kid to try, right?


SAM

What'd you bring?


[DEAN digs in his bag and pulls out a radio and hangs it on a nail on a tree.]


DEAN

Well, she's only been dead a week, right? So I figured she could use as much help as she can get, so...


[DEAN pulls the coffeemaker from his bag.]


SAM

Really?


DEAN

Whatever works.


[CASTIEL, ANGEL #1 and ANGEL #2 are sitting in a waiting room]


CASTIEL

How much longer?


ANGEL #2

You have someplace to be?


[The doors swing open and BARTHOLOMEW walks in.]


BARTHOLOMEW

His blade.


[ANGEL #2 hands it over]


BARTHOLOMEW

Standard security protocol. Can't be too careful these days.


CASTIEL

Hello, Bartholomew.


BARTHOLOMEW [with a big smile]

Castiel.


[They hug]


BARTHOLOMEW

It has been too long.


[Back with SAM and DEAN in the forest. Its dark and they are waiting.]


SAM

You feel that? I think I felt a chill.


DEAN

Yeah. It's 'cause it's cold.


[DEAN dials his phone and waits to leave a message]


DEAN

Crowley, it's Dean. Call me when you get this.


SAM

Really, Dean?


DEAN

What?


SAM

That's your third unanswered voicemail. You ever think maybe he's just not that into you?


DEAN

Well, he is our last confirmed link to Ms. Tran. Yes, he is a flaming douche, but at least we know he's real, which is more than we can say for this Candy no-show.


[Suddenly the radio on the tree buzzes to life and they can hear clipits of a woman's voice through the static. The brothers jump up to investigate.]


SAM

Candy? Are -- are you there? Is that you, Candy?


CANDY [from the radio]

Hello? Hello?


[BARTHOLOMEW and CASTIEL sit in the waiting room talking.]


BARTHOLOMEW

Madness, wasn't it? A puny force of 20 behind enemy lines, launching an incursion against Raphael and his loyalists.


CASTIEL

It was a calculated risk.


BARTHOLOMEW

I thought you'd gone insane, and I questioned your leadership, second-guessed every step of the campaign. But you were my commander. I held my tongue. I followed orders. Raphael fled. Most of his loyalists, dead or captured. Your gambit paid off. You...Won.


CASTIEL

We won.


BARTHOLOMEW

Word of your victory spread. You got called back to the garrison. You became the great Castiel... While I stayed behind, just a grunt.


CASTIEL

You gained a reputation for yourself, as well. The captives I left in your care, you tortured and killed them.


BARTHOLOMEW

I was ordered to kill those captives. You've been flying solo for so long, you've forgotten that's what angels do. We follow orders.


CASTIEL

Not you, though. Not anymore.


BARTHOLOMEW

That's right. I give them.


[SAM and DEAN are trying to adjust the radio buttons to hear CANDY better]


SAM

There. There. There. Stop. Stop. Stop. Candy?


CANDY

...in the box. They put me in the box. All of us in boxes, side by side. Me, Jerome, Linda.


DEAN

Linda's --


SAM

Ms. Tran.

Candy, these boxes, where were they?


CANDY

I don't know. They were cold. Dark. There -- there was a vent. We could talk to one another.


SAM

Okay, and the walls, can you describe them?


CANDY

Bare. Cement. Except for the door. That was...metal, but...like, ridged.


DEAN

Ridged? You mean like corrugated?


CANDY

Yeah! I tried to lift the door, but I couldn't. Locked from the outside.


DEAN [to SAM]

Like a storage unit?


SAM

Maybe.

Candy, who was holding you there?


CANDY

Two men. It was so dark in the box. When they came, I could barely see. The -- the first guy was British, I think. Kind of short, loved hearing himself talk.


SAM

Crowley. And what do they want?


CANDY

Said I was worth more alive than dead. But he stopped coming. Then it was just the other guy. We thought with just him...we'd try to escape. I ran so hard, so far, but...


SAM

Candy? Candy, are you there? What about Ms. Tran? Candy?


CANDY

I don't know. Maybe she survived.


DEAN

Maybe? That's not what you told her son.


CANDY

I said she was alive. I don't know what happened after. For her sake, I hope she's dead.


[The scene changes to MRS. TRAN scraping at her chain with a file. Suddenly the storage door opens and she jumps back screaming as a shadowy figure walks in.]


MRS TRAN

No! No! No! No! No!


ACT THREE
[The Winchesters drive down the road in the IMPALA]


SAM

Okay, there are three storage facilities nearby. The closest one is about a mile up the road. Oh, and I, uh -- I dug up some stuff on Candy. Turns out she was the kept woman of a powerful Congressman. Gossip blog said he worshiped the ground she walked on, literally. He, uh -- had a foot fetish.


DEAN

So, Crowley was holding the beloved tootsies of a powerful politician?


SAM

And the beloved mother of a powerful Prophet.


DEAN

Human leverage. But why kill Candy?


SAM

Well, you heard her. Uh, she tried to make a break for it. Maybe Crowley wanted to make an example.


DEAN

No. No. The guy left in charge. Crowley wanted the victims alive.


SAM

So, what, you want to give him a medal? I mean, Crowley's the one who put them in the cells in the first place.


DEAN

Yeah, I know. I'm just talking it out. You know, working the case. Businesslike.


[SAM grunts and rolls his eyes.]


[Scene changes to BARTHOLOMEW and CASTIEL still talking while walking around BARTHOLOMEW's facility.]


BARTHOLOMEW

Realizing they were more trouble than they were worth, we purged our human allies, then commandeered Boyle Ministries, Inc. For our own use.


CASTIEL

Buddy Boyle. So, you killed him.


BARTHOLOMEW

No. We made him and his colleagues vessels. At least those who didn't go "pop."


BARTHOLOMEW

You nervous, Castiel?


CASTIEL

Your followers want me dead. I'm not entirely certain you don't, too.


BARTHOLOMEW

If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.


CASTIEL

So, we're friends here?


BARTHOLOMEW

Yes.


CASTIEL

And I'm free to go?


BARTHOLOMEW

Of course. Though, I don't know why you would. What's out there for you, Castiel? What do you really expect to accomplish on your own? You'll never find Metatron that way.


CASTIEL

How'd you know about Metatron?


BARTHOLOMEW

I figured that's why you were pursuing Rebecca, engaging with her follower. We have different methods, Cas, but we want the same thing -- to find Metatron and restore our kind to heaven.


CASTIEL

Then why kill Rebecca and her followers? They're no threat to you.


BARTHOLOMEW

Perhaps, but better to nip a fledgling faction in the bud than let it grow into a bigger threat down the road. A drop of blood to save a gallon.


CASTIEL

I don't agree.


BARTHOLOMEW

I'm not asking you to. I will outrace Malachi in the hunt for Metatron, and I will certainly outrace you on your own. But if you can set aside your qualms about methods for one second, there's no reason the two of us can't take him down. Together.


[DEAN and SAM enter a storage facility office and DEAN is making a guess about what they attendant is going to look like.]


DEAN

Let me guess -- 5'5", pasty white, black-rimmed hipster glasses just like the last place.


[DEAN rings the bell and a guy exactly matching DEAN's description pops up to help them.]


DEAN [smugly]

Nailed it.


DEL

Can I help you?


DEAN

Yeah, hi. Agents Nicks and McVie. Need to take a look at your, uh, rental records.


DEL

Uh, my manager's not here. I really don't think I should --


DEAN

Hey! The records, pal.


DEL

Yeah. Barry! Bring out the rental binder!


[BARRY walks out holding a large binder in his hands. He also fits DEAN's 'storage-unit-attendant-description' to perfection. DEAN and SAM exchanges amused looks. BARRY hands the binder to DEAN]


DEL

There you go, sir.


[As DEAN thumbs through the binder, SAM walks over to a map of the storage facility on the wall]


SAM

Hey. Okay, check it out. Corridor "Q." Three adjacent units separate from the others. I mean, Candy said there were three hostages, right?


DEAN

Yeah.

[He finds the records in the binder]

Okay. It's all leased by the same guy -- a D. Webster.


SAM

D. Webster? Wait. As in, like, Daniel Webster?


DEAN

Well, I know a lame Crowley in-joke when I see one.


DEL

You guys say "D. Webster"?


DEAN

Yeah. Yeah, you -- you seen him?


DEL

Uh, no, just... I know his name from the records. He's leasing another unit on the other side of the facility. I could show you.


DEAN

Yeah. That'd be great.

[to SAM]

All right, why don't you take corridor "Q"? I'll go with, uh, Del the funky homosapien.


[DEAN and DEL enter another storage unit and DEAN slowly walks through it. He picks up a scythe and looks it over.]


DEAN

Hmm.


[SAM walks down Corridor "Q" and picks the lock on the last unit. As the door opens, MRS TRAN shrinks away in fright. SAM rushes to her.]


SAM

Ms. Tran! Ms. Tran! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, it's me. It's Sam. It's Sam.


MRS TRAN

Sam?


SAM

Oh, my gosh.


MRS TRAN

Sam? We have to get out of here before it comes back. Is Kevin with you?


[DEAN is still roaming the storage unit while DEL watches SAM and MRS TRAN on his phone through their units security camera. He locks the door from the phone, trapping SAM and MRS TRAN inside.]


DEAN

You sure this is the one leased by Webster?


DEL

Yeah, this is it.


DEAN [reading a name on a box which reads "Bob Gunderson"]

This isn't Crowley's unit.


[DEL pulls a knife out of his belt and knocks DEAN unconscious from behind.]


[CASTIEL and BARTHOLOMEW enter a office with a large map on the wall with dots on it.]


CASTIEL

What are these locations?


BARTHOLOMEW

Sightings of Metatron.


CASTIEL

He's been on earth?


BARTHOLOMEW

Three times we know of so far. That's the benefit of a massive ground operation. Eyes and ears everywhere. It's only a matter of time before we get an active location.


CASTIEL

Why wait? With this kind of information, I'd lure him out.


BARTHOLOMEW

I knew you'd be an asset. No one's as motivated as you to take him down. I've had my hands so full with the factions, it's distracted me from the real goal. But with you by my side -- the new boss and the ultimate rebel working together -- think of the message that would send to would-be dissidents. They'd finally understand that resistance is futile. Think of the bloodshed we could avert... What a united angelkind could accomplish in heaven... Elsewhere.


[The doors open and ANGEL #1 and ANGEL #2 drag in the angel from the funeral. BARTHOLOMEW kneels and puts an angel blade to his throat.]


CASTIEL

Bart, what are you doing?


BARTHOLOMEW

What needs to be done. I'm gonna torture the rebel, find out what he knows, then kill him. And you're going to help.


ACT FOUR
[SAM removes MRS TRAN's shackles with his Swiss army knife.]


SAM

Here we go. All right.


MRS TRAN [rubbing her wrists]

Oh. There's a -- there's an electrical line, leads to the control panel.


SAM [pops off the cover and a mess of wires fall out]

Okay, this might take a while.


MRS TRAN [takes the Swiss army knife from SAM and starts to work on the wires]

We have to unplug the ground wire first. If this is standard U.S. color coding, it should be the green one.


SAM

Okay.


MRS TRAN

Helping Kevin with his engineering-club assignments, I picked up a thing or two. I'm sure he insisted, but I trust you weren't foolish enough to bring Kevin along on this mission. That you left him someplace safe?


SAM [quietly]

Of course.


MRS TRAN

Good. Now all we have to do is get this door open, get the hell out of here, and you will bring me to my son.


[SAM can't lie to her anymore and so he gently takes her hand]


SAM

Listen. Ms. Tran.


[His eyes tell the whole story and MRS TRAN shattered face shows she knows what his is trying to tell her. She starts to break down and then steels herself. She goes back to the wires]


MRS TRAN

You will take me to my son. Flashlight. Flashlight!


[SAM raises the flashlight to light the box.]


[DEAN regains consciousness on the floor. The first thing his sees when he opens his eyes in the site of BARRY bleeding from his slashed throat into a bowl. DEL is muttering.]


DEL

"Trust me," he says. "You definitely want to be a part of this -- "a chance to get in on the ground floor of my operation, "a real learning experience. Consider it a stepping stone, my lad -- like an internship."

Should've known. Internships suck.


DEAN [painfully sitting up as his hands are tied behind him to a post.]

So, you're the one. You're the one who Crowley left in charge.


DEL

Yeah. What a privilege. Feeding the apes, hosing the floors, washing out the honey buckets, and for zero credit. The boss, M.I.A.


[As DEL monologs, DEAN slowly moves his right leg up and we can see Ruby's knife stuck in his boot. DEAN pulls at his bonds trying to get his hand free.]


DEL

Too important to show for work, to even return my calls. And you know the worst part? I wasn't even allowed to kill anyone. I was told to protect them. I mean, how sick is that? Am I not a young, vital demon with basic demon needs and rights? And when I call Crowley to inform him that I've single-handedly caught the Winchesters, if he even answers my call, think I'll get a thank you? Ha!


DEAN

Yeah, you're right, kid. He won't give you credit. If anything, he'll be pissed.


DEL

What?


DEAN

Well, me and Crowley, we're -- we're tight now. Thick as thieves. Saw him just last month. We, uh, had a grand ol' time.


DEL

So, that's where he's been. Out partying with humans, with hunters?! While I languish here in this go-nowhere, no-kill joke of a job.


DEAN

"Partying" is a bit of an exaggeration.


DEL

This job blows! [He rips off his nametag] I quit.


[Scene changes to BARTHOLOMEW torturing the Funeral Angel]


BARTHOLOMEW

Tell me where they are.


FUNERAL ANGEL

I told you. They're dead. I'm the last.


CASTIEL

Can't you see he's telling the truth? He's done.


BARTHOLOMEW

Yes, I believe he is.

[holds out the angel blade to CASTIEL]

Now finish him off.


CASTIEL

Bartholomew, it doesn't need to be like this.


BARTHOLOMEW

Castiel, get your head out of the sand. Do you know why they brought you back from the battlefield? The truth?


CASTIEL

Yes, I know the truth.


BARTHOLOMEW

Our leaders wanted those captives killed, and they knew you'd stand in the way of their order. Said you didn't have it in you. That you couldn't do what needed to be done. But I know different. I know you've changed.


CASTIEL

I'm not a murderer.


BARTHOLOMEW

You weren't. Not then. But since then, you've slaughtered thousands of angels. You killed Malachi's man

for his Grace.


CASTIEL

Who I was, what I did, that's not who I am.


BARTHOLOMEW

No? Then who are you? I want to work with you, Castiel, but I need proof. They need proof that they were wrong. That you can do what has to be done. This has to be done.


CASTIEL

I was never free to leave. My only choice was to obey or be killed. Well, I choose.


[CASTIEL hands the angel blade back to BARTHOLOMEW]


BARTHOLOMEW

I am truly sorry to hear that.


[BARTHOLOMEW swings around and stabs Funeral Angel in the heart. He flashes and then dies]


CASTIEL

No!


[Back to DEAN and DEL in the storage unit. DEL is straddling DEAN on the floor and holding a knife to his throat]


DEL

Do you know how long it's been since I've done this? I thank you for reminding me what I truly am.


[DEL digs the knife into DEAN throat right below his right ear and drags it an inch or two. Blood seeps out of the gash. DEL then raises the knife and goes to stab DEAN in the heart but at that second, SAM raises the door and rushed for DEL. DEAN kicks him away and SAM knocks him against a shelf.]


[Back to BARTHOLOMEW and CASTIEL]


BARTHOLOMEW

As your refusal makes perfectly clear, you always thought you were better than me. Shall we put your superiority to the test once and for all?


[BARTHOLOMEW punches CASTIEL in the mouth twice]


CASTIEL

No. Angels fighting angels has to stop somewhere. Might as well stop with me.


BARTHOLOMEW [picking up an angel blade]

Fine.


[He lunges for CASTIEL but CASTIEL is able to grab his arm.]


BARTHOLOMEW [as ANGEL #1 and #2 come to the rescue]

Stand down! This is between me and the rebel.


[CASTIEL does a trick move and suddenly has BARTHOLOMEW in a headlock with his angel blade to his throat]


BARTHOLOMEW

To the victor. Do it.


CASTIEL [letting him go]

No.


BARTHOLOMEW

What are you now? A penitent?


CASTIEL

I'm nothing.


BARTHOLOMEW

You never did understand, Castiel. There can be no peace without bloodshed.

[BARTHOLOMEW draws another angel blade and lunges for CASTIEL again. CASTIEL wrestles with him and finally stabs BARTHOLOMEW and kills him.]

CASTIEL [turning to leave]

Let me pass.


[ANGEL #1 and #2 let him leave]


[Back at the storage units, DEL is on his knees in front of the Winchsters.]


DEL

Do it. Kill me.


SAM

No, we're saving you for someone else.


DEL

Crowley.


SAM

Much worse.


[SAM holds the knife out and MRS TRAN walks in]


DEAN

Do the honors, Ms. Tran.


MRS TRAN

With pleasure.


DEL

Hey, lady. I swear. I was just following ord--


[MRS TRAN stabs him in the heart]


MRS TRAN

Take me to my son.


ACT FIVE
[SAM and DEAN walk through the main room in the bunker.]


DEAN

Kevin? You here? Kev?


KEVIN [appearing]

Well?


DEAN

We got her. She's alive. She's here. But we wanted to give you a moment to... You know, process.


KEVIN

Oh. I, uh... Does she know?


MRS TRAN [coming up behind KEVIN]

Kevin? Hello, son.


KEVIN [gently]

Hey, Mom.


MRS TRAN [crying]

Oh.


[Later MRS TRAN and DEAN are going through KEVIN's things.]


DEAN

So, this is, uh -- this is all of it. You know, hunter's tools -- notebooks, papers, pencils, P.S.A.T. results. Perfect score. Way to go, kid.


MRS TRAN [takes a ring out of a box]

This. This is it. His father's. Mr. Tran died when Kevin was a baby. It's the only piece of his father Kevin ever had. If Kevin's s-spirit is bound to some object here... This is it.


DEAN

Listen, Ms. Tran. There's a lot that we don't know about this heaven situation. There are risks to taking Kevin home with you. Now, spirits, the longer that they're in the veil, they have a way of... Well, it doesn't end up well.


MRS TRAN

He's my son. It's my job to keep him safe for as long as I can.


[DEAN nods.]


[CASTIEL is standing in a cemetery talking to the grave of Darlene Foster]


Sorry I created this chaos. Sorry I couldn't do more to fix it. You may have lost the war, Rebecca, but you tried a new way. You have my respect for that.


[A hand drops on CASTIEL's shoulder. It is ANGEL #1.]


CASTIEL

I don't want to fight. But if I have to, I will.


ANGEL #1

I didn't come to fight. When I fell, I thought I had no choice, but yesterday, you've showed me that there is a choice. And I choose you.


CASTIEL

I'm sorry. I'm no leader.


ANGEL #1

Yes, you are. If you will have me, Castiel, I will follow you. And I am not the only one.


[More angels walk up to join]


[Back in the bunker, Kevin is talking to the brothers at the foot of the stairs.]


KEVIN

She was held and tortured for a year because of me. Now that I found her, I'm not letting her out of my sight. She's my responsibility.


SAM

And you were ours. And we failed you. I --


KEVIN

Sam. I know that wasn't you. Go put a blade in that asshat who possessed you and we'll call it square.

[SAM nods gratefully]

Guys. Thank you.


DEAN

You can thank us when we get you to heaven where you belong. Okay, until then, enjoy your time with your mom. The, uh, uninterrupted, 24/7, no-escape quality time.


KEVIN [smiling wide]

Dick.

Hey, before I go... Will you guys promise me something?


DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Anything.


KEVIN

Can you two... Get over it? Dudes, just 'cause you couldn't see me doesn't mean I couldn't see you. The drama, the fighting... It's stupid. My mom's taking home a ghost. You two... You're both still here.


SAM

Of course. Promise.


DEAN

Yeah.


KEVIN

Good.


[KEVIN and MRS TRAN walk up the stairs and out the front door. DEAN watches them go.]


DEAN [turning around]

Well, that was...


[But SAM has already left the room]
