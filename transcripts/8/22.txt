INT. CABIN - NIGHT

GIRL

I can't believe you finally came up here with me.


TOMMY COLLINS

Why wouldn't I?


SHELLY

I love this place. It's like...I can breathe, you know?


Tommy [chuckles] you okay?

TOMMY (AT THE WINDOW)

Aah! Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.


[Creature growls ]


Did you hear that?

SHELLY

What?


TOMMY

The growl?


SHELLY

No.Maybe it's a bear.


TOMMY

[Creature growls ]

Shelly, get back!


SHELLY

Baby, what is wrong?


TOMMY

It's not a bear. It's a Wendigo. Hide in the bedroom. Right now. Hide, Shelly!


SHELLY

Tommy, I don't hear anything.


TOMMY GETS A GAS CANISTER FROM HIS BAG


SHELLY

What are you doing?

TOMMY

I'm gonna light his ugly ass on fire. Get back.


[Creature growls ]


TOMMY CLUTCHES AT HIS HEAD

Aah!


[Growling continues ]


SHELLY

What's...H-happening?

[Crying]


TOMMY'S HEAD EXPLODES


Tommy!

ACT ONE
INT. BUNKER

SAM

Please tell me that's everything.


DEAN Yeah.

[Chuckles ]


No, not even close. You see, the Men of Letters kept files on every demonic possession for the last 300 years, I mean, we've got Borden, Lizzy, all the way to Crane, Ichabod.

SAM


Aah.


DEAN

How you feeling?


SAM

Honestly, um... My, uh, my whole body hurts. I feel nauseous and like I'm starving at the same time, and everything smells like rotting meat.


DEAN

I've had that hangover. Jaeger, man. Maybe you should, uh, take a break, get some air.


SAM

Dean, the only thing that's gonna make me feel better is finishing this.


DEAN

All right. Well, I'll go get you some grub, keep your strength up.


DEAN LEAVES


CASTIEL ENTERS


CASTIEL

Morning.

DEAN BRUSHES HIM OFF, CAS LOOKING A BIT HURT

I like this bunker. It's orderly.


SAM

Oh, give us a few months. Dean wants to get a ping-pong table.


CASTIEL

I've heard of that. It's a game, right?

[Groans ]


SAM

Are you okay?


CASTIEL

My wound isn't healing as quickly as I'd hoped... But I am getting better. And you're getting worse.


SAM

Well, two trials down, one to go.


CASTIEL

And the final test, do you – you know what it is?


SAM

I have to cure a demon.


CASTIEL

Of what? [Chuckles]


SAM

That's what we're trying to figure out.


DEAN RETURNS WITH A PLATE


DEAN

Soup's on. There we go.


DEAN SIPS THE OPEN BEER


I think this is, uh... Oh, it's still good.


SAM

A half-drunk beer, jerky, and three peanut-butter cups?


DEAN

Yeah, we're – we're running a little low. I'll make a run.


CASTIEL

Dean, I can go with you.


A FEW SECONDS PASS BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN

Dean. I'm sorry.


DEAN

For what?


CASTIEL

For everything.


DEAN

Everything? Like, uh... Like ignoring us?


CASTIEL

Yes.


DEAN

Or like bolting off with the Angel Tablet, then losing it 'cause you didn't trust me? You didn't trust me.


CASTIEL

Yes.


DEAN

Yeah. Nah, that's not gonna cut it. Not this time. So you can take your little apology and you cram it up your ass.


CASTIEL

Dean, I thought I was doing the right thing.


DEAN

Yeah, you always do.


SAM

[Clears throat ]

Hey, uh, do we have a room 7B?


INT. ROOM 7B IN THE BUNKER. IT IS FILLED WITH ARCHIVE FILES


SAM

Dude, go easy on Cas, okay. He's one of the good guys.


DEAN

Dude, if anybody else – I mean anybody – pulled that kind of crap, I would stab them in their neck on principle. Why should I give him a free pass?


SAM

Because it's Cas.


DEAN

What are we supposed to be looking for down here?


SAM

Um, anything on case 1138. It was a class 5 infernal event – St. Louis, March 8, 1957.


DEAN

"Class 5 infernal event"?


SAM

Yeah. See, the Letters have this whole rating system. "The Exorcist" would have been a class 2.


DEAN

All right, so, what makes this puppet show so special?


SAM

It was weird.


DEAN

Weird how?


SAM

No clue. One of the files just had a note written in the margin about room 7B and the word "weird" with three exclamation points.


DEAN

Good times.


SAM

Yeah. Got it.


DEAN

Sammy, check this out.

DEAN PUSHES BACK TO SETS OF SHELVES TO REVEAL AN AREA WITH A DEVILS TRAP ON THE FLOOR AND MANACLES ON THE WALLS

DEAN

Whoa.


SAM

Is that a Devil's Trap? It takes up half the room. These chains – they have spellwork etched into them.


DEAN

So we have a dungeon. Finally! What do you got there?


SAM

Movie night?


INT DARKENED ROOM WITH MOVIE PROJECTOR SET UP. IT STARTS PLAYING AN OLD BALCK AND WHITE HOME MOVIE. [Projector clicking ]


JOSIE

Simon, we're filming.


SIMON

Um, hello, world.


JOSIE

So this new ritual we're going to see, This new type of exorcism,h-how does it work?


SIMON I don't know. It's my first time.


SAM

Wait,is that Abaddon?


Woman:

WOMAN IS HEARD FAINTLY WHIMPERING


DEAN

It's not killy enough.


SAM

It's got to be the, uh, the chick she possessed.


WOMAN

[Screaming ] [Grunting ]


FATHER THOMPSON

Hurry. We must do it now.


WOMAN

[Screaming, grunting ]

Dead! They're all dead! Everyone you ever loved...


SAM

Hey, those chains look exactly like the ones in our dungeon.


Castiel LOOKS AT SAM A BIT SURPRISED

CASTIEL

In your what?


DEAN

Demon on a leash – cool.


WOMAN

[Screaming, grunting continue ]

Aah! Aah! Aah!

[Screaming ]


FATHER THOMPSON AND SIMON

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus... hanc animam redintegra...


WOMAN

[Grunts ]


FATHER THOMPSON AND SIMON

Lustra!


SCREEN GOES WHITE AND THE BODY OF THE WOMAN FALLS TO THE FLOOR DEAD HER HEART MISSING

[Cracking ]


JOSIE

She's dead.


FATHER THOMPSON AND SIMON

[Coughing ]


JOSIE

Where's the demon?


FATHER THOMPSON

Stop filming.


JOSIE

What happened?


FATHER THOMSON

Will you just stop?!


[Projector clicks and stops ]

DEAN

Well, that was weird... With three exclamation points.


SAM

That wasn't a normal exorcism. They changed the words.


CASTIEL

I believe "lustra" is Latin for wash or cleanse.


DEAN

Oh, yeah, 'cause that was the most freaky thing was the vocabulary. What about the bloody high five or the chest burster? Anything else on the film, like director's commentary, sequel, maybe?


SAM

Yeah, listen to this. The older priest, Max Thompson, bit the dust in '58, but the younger one is still alive and still in St. Louis.


DEAN

Think this kind of weird is worth the drive?


SAM

Dean, everything in those folders – the possessions, the deals, all of it – we've seen that before, but that – That was all new. Yeah, it's worth the drive.


DEAN

All right. Let's roll.

CASTIEL STANDS UP

DEAN

Not you.


CASTIEL

Sam is more damaged than I am.


DEAN

Yeah, well, you know, even banged up, Sammy comes through.


CASTIEL

Dean, I just want to help.


DEAN

We don't need your help. Just stay here and – and get better.


INT CHURCH. ST LOUIS


FATHER SIMON

Father Thompson had some unorthodox ideas, which is why the Men of Letters were interested.


DEAN

Unorthodox how?

SAM

What exactly do you mean, "saved"?


FATHER SIMON

A demon is a human soul, twisted and corrupted by its time in Hell. Father Thompson believed that you could wash that taint away and restore their humanity.


DEAN

So, what, they just stay in whatever schmuck they're possessing and – and get a ticket upstairs?


FATHER SIMON

I wish I knew.


SAM

Okay, but this – this ritual... Can cure a demon?


FATHER SIMON

I suppose, if it worked, but that night, something went terribly wrong. The Demon escaped into the world, and that poor old woman... It was horrible. I know father Thompson kept trying. There were other possessions, experiments, but I couldn't face that – not again. And then, a few months later... He was dead.

DEAN

How'd that happen?

FATHER SIMON

Something tore him apart.

SAM

Did he keep any, uh [Coughs] Did he keep records or – [coughing] Uh [clears throat] do you have a-a bathroom, maybe?

FATHER SIMON POINTS TO THE BACK OF THE CHURCH

Thanks.

FATHER SIMON

Is he all right?

DEAN

Uh, no, padre. He's...pretty damn far from all right. That's why we're here.

FATHER SIMON

I don't understand.

DEAN

Well, short story is, uh, Sammy there is gonna take whatever shredded your friend and every other black-eyed bitch out there, and he's gonna get rid of them for good.


FATHER SIMON

He is? In his condition?


DEAN

Father, over the past couple of months, I've seen him do crap that I didn't even think was possible. I mean, sure, he's miserable and he's hurting, but you know what? There's not a doubt in my mind that he's gonna cross that finish line – not one. So, will you help us?


FATHER SIMON

I'll get Father Thompson's things for you.


DEAN

Thank you.

INTERIOR. MINIMART. CASTIEL IS SHOPPING PICKING UP ITEMS WHICH ARE DEAN'S FAVOURITES - JERKY, HIS FAVOURITE PORN MAGAZINE, BEER, TOILET PAPER... THE CLERK FOLLOWS HIM AROUND AS HE KNOCKS THINGS OVER REPEATING "DUDE!

CASTIEL

I – I have money.


CASTIEL GETS TO THE REGISTER HE LOOKS AT A SMALL PIE STAND

Where's the pie?


CHRIS THE ATTENDANT

I think we're out.


CASTIEL

You don't understand.


CASTIEL GRABS THE ATTENDANT

I. NEED. PIE

[SOUND OF WINGS RUSTLING]

METATRON

Put the virgin down, Castiel. We need to talk.

ACT TWO
CASTIEL

You're Metatron? The Metatron?


METATRON

Yes. In public, it's Marv.


CASTIEL

Marv.


METATRON

And you're Castiel. Kevin Tran told me about you.


CASTIEL

He did?

METATRON

Yeah. According to him, you and I have a lot in common. We're both free thinkers. We're both on heaven's most wanted list. I thought we could socialize, maybe grab a bite.


CASTIEL

I'm sorry – we can...What?


METATRON

Look, I've been on sabbatical. I'm trying to play catch-up, but I have to talk to somebody about what's going on back home.


CASTIEL

And by home, you mean heaven?


METATRON

Right. I've been looking around, crawling through a few divine nooks and crannies, and from what I can see, without the Archangels, it's a mess up there. Open warfare.


CASTIEL

I thought Naomi was running things now.


METATRON

Is that what she told you? I mean, Naomi's a player – don't get me wrong – just one of many. There are factions upon factions, all fighting, betraying each other. It's just a matter of time before they start ripping each other apart. It's all broken.


CASTIEL

I know, I'm the one who broke it. There was a time when I thought I could lead our people, but I was mistaken. I spilled so much blood. And I've tried to atone for my sins and I did penance. And I [sighs] betrayed my friends to protect our secrets, but I've just failed. And now –


METATRON

Look, I know. But now the angels – heaven – need someone to come to the rescue. They need us.

CASTIEL

Us?


METATRON

Yeah. Just – just picture it. We ride to the rescue, save the day – make a great story. Look, the angels are like a big, dysfunctional family. We need to lock them all in a room until we work these problems out – all the factions, you, me –

CASTIEL

What, like a big family meeting?


METATRON

Exactly. which is why we have to shut down heaven.


CASTIEL

What?


METATRON

Do you like crepes?


CASTIEL

Wait –


METATRON

Eugenie's in Ojai makes the greatest caramel apple crepes.


METATRON DISAPPEARS


CASTIEL

Metatron – Marv.


INT. BUNKER

SAM

I can't find Cas. You think he blew town?


DEAN

Sounds like him. So it turns out that, uh, Father Thompson recorded all of his demon-cure tests. This one here, this was the last one – two days before he died.


DEAN STARTS PLAYING THE RECORDING


FATHER THOMPSON

The date is August 3, 1958. This is trial 19, hour 1. My subject is Peter Kent. Mr. Kent is the father of two young sons, and three weeks ago, he was possessed by a demon. I'm going to ask you a question now. When you crawled into Mr. Kent and ate his children, how did it feel?


PETER KENT

Orgasmic. [Snarls ] Aah! [Groans ]


FATHER THOMPSON

The first dose has been administered.


DEAN

Do we know what padre was dosing number-one dad up with?


PETER KENT

[Snarling]


SAM

Uh, yeah, his own purified blood.


DEAN

Purified how?


SAM

Before he started, Father Thompson went to confession.


FATHER THOMPSON

This is trial 19, hour 2


PETER KENT

[Snarling ]


FATHER THOMPSON

When you ate his children, how did it feel?


PETER KENT

Stringy! Aah!


FATHER THOMPSON

The second dose, has been administered Hour 4


FATHER THOMPSON

When you ate his children –


PETER KENT

Kiss my ass!


FATHER THOMPSON

How did it feel?


PETER KENT

Soft. Aaaah!


FATHER THOMPSON

The sixth dose has been administered


PETER KENT

Stop.


FATHER THOMPSON

How...


PETER KENT

Please.

Aah!


FATHER THOMPSON

...did it...


PETER KENT

Aah! Aah!


FATHER THOMPSON

...feel?


PETER KENT

Stop!!


[Breathing heavily]

FATHER THOMPSON

Hour 8, the subject is prepped.


PETER KENT

Aah! Aah!


[Breathing heavily ]

FATHER THOMPSON

Exorcizamus te,omnis immundus spiritus.

Hanc animam redintegra,

lustra! Lustra!


FATHER THOMPSON

When you ate his children, how did it feel?


PETER KENT

They were screaming...and I laughed. Why did I laugh? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. God, I was a monster.


FATHER THOMPSON

But now you are a man again. And you have been saved.


SAM

Did he just... Cure a demon?


DEAN

Maybe.


SAM [Exhales softly ]


DEAN

Could we take this hoodoo on a test drive?


SAM

Um, I mean, I have the exorcism right here. All we need is the blood, consecrated ground, and a demon.

So, what? We summon a demon, trap it –


DEAN

Or – or we use one that we've already tagged.

Do we still have dad's old army field surgeon's kit?


SAM

It's in the trunk. Why?


DEAN

Yeah, I think it's time we put humpty dumpty back together again.


INT A SMALL CAFE

[SOUND OF FEATHERS RUSTLING ]

CASTIEL

Why did you leave?


METATRON I can't have this conversation on an empty stomach.


WAITRESS

Here you go.


METATRON

Thank you.


WAITRESS

[TURNS TO CASTIEL ]

Can I get you anything?


CASTIEL

Coffee, please.


WAITRESS

Sure. Cool coat.


CASTIEL

No,it's actually quite warm.


WAITRESS

Cute and funny – okay.


METATRON

I should have picked a better-looking vessel.


CASTIEL

What did you mean, we can shut down Heaven?


METATRON

Oh, you know, the trials – God's little"pull in case of emergency"

the Leviathans get out of control, you put them in Purgatory.

Demons get a little too demonic, toss 'em into Hell.

Angels get uppity, slam the pearly gates.


CASTIEL

Are you saying you know the trials to close heaven?


METATRON

I wrote 'em down. It's not something you forget.

Look, I think a little alone time would be good for the angels.

At the very least, it would s –

[dog barking in distance ]

It would stop the fighting up there from spilling out down here,

which will happen. It always does.


CASTIEL

You're gonna complete these tests?


METATRON

No. I can't. I am a pencil pusher, always have been. I'm not strong enough. But you – you are a warrior. I've got the plan. You've got the muscle. We can do this. Heaven needs your help, Castiel.

CASTIEL

I am the one that caused these problems.

I should be the one to fix them.

METATRON

But you understand this is, um, not going to be easy.

CASTIEL

I understand.


METATRON

No, you don't. See our waitress? She's the first trial – got to cut her heart out.

CASTIEL

What? No, she's... She's just a girl.


METATRON

No, she isn't. She's a Nephilim, an abomination.


CASTIEL

She's the offspring of an angel and a human? I thought that wasn't allowed.


METATRON

It's not. There's only one on Earth, and you are looking at it.


CASTIEL

But she didn't choose to be a Nephilim, so she's innocent.


METATRON

Yes, she is. I told you it wasn't gonna be easy. But if you want to do this, Castiel, if you really want to do this, you got to ask yourself what's more important – her life or your family?


INT. BUNKER

SAM

So you really think this will work?


DEAN

Dude, we got needles. We got thread. We've seen "Young Frankenstein" about a thousand times. Yeah, we're golden.

SAM

Ugh. [Sighs ] This is gonna be disgusting.


DEAN

Uh-huh.

ACT THREE
[SAM finishes sewing ABADDON's head back on. After a moment, she wakes up]


ABADDON

[cracks her head and sighs in relief]

Morning, sunshines.


DEAN

It worked. You owe me a beer.


ABADDON

And I owe you both so, so much. I can't wait to tear out those pretty green eyes.


SAM

Good luck with that.


DEAN

We figured kittydidn't need her claws.


ABADDON

Then I'll stump you to death. It'll be swell.


[Grunts ]

SAM

Yeah, that's not gonna happen, either. The bullet – remember?


[Gunshot ]

DEAN

So you sit there like a good little bitch. We're gonna consecrate the ground, and you're gonna get to fessing up.


ABADDON

Oh, I know this tune.


SAM

I doubt that.


ABADDON

Father Max Thompson, born October 12, 1910. Died August 5, 1958. Who do you think ripped him apart? Word got back to home office that Maxie was messing with things, so we made an example.It wasn't my most artful kill, but it was effective. And bonus – before he died, he told me all about Josie Sands. I found her, and I rode her into the Men of Letters.

[Laughs]And what I did to them, that was art.


SAM

So you know what Max was doing?


ABADDON

Fella screamed the basics... but it'll never work.


DEAN

You keep telling yourself that.


SAMS CELL RINGS WITH THE NUMBER '666'

[Cellphone beeps ]


CROWLEY

Hello, boy.


SAM

Crowley.


ABADDON

Crowley? The salesman?


DEAN

Try the King of Hell.


ABADDON

This is a joke, right?


[Sighs ]


DEAN

Stay.


[Grunts ]

[Grunting, breathing heavily ]

ABADDON STARTS LOOKING AROUND AND SEES A BOX CONTAINING HER HANDS AND WILLS ONE OF THEM FROM THE BOX AND MAKES IT COME TOWARD HER


SAM

Hold on.


[Cellphone beeps ]

How'd you get this number?


Crowley V.O

Ah, first things first – what are you wearing?


DEAN

Oh, okay, hanging up now. Hang up.


Crowley V.O

Fine. This isn't a social call. I was wondering. You lads been reading the papers, say, Denver Times from yesterday? No? Well, you should. It's side-splitting.


[Creaks ]

What the hell – I'm sexting you an address. Check it out. Then we'll talk. Cheerio.


SAM

Wait, what? Crowley?


[Cellphone beeps ]

ABADDON IS WILLING HER HAND TOWARD HER AND MAKES IT JUMP UNTO HER SHOULDER MAKING IT REACH INTO HER MOUTH AND TAKE OUT THE BULLET


DEAN

Here it is. Vic's name is Tommy Collins. Tommy. Why do I know that name?


SAM

Well, Tommy Collins, we saved him from a Wendigo like forever ago.


DEAN

Okay, and, what, you think that Crowley blew his head off? Well, what are we dealing with here? Some sort of Demon-Wendigo team-up?


SAM

Uh, no clue.


DEAN

All right, well, we'll pour one out for Tommy later. As far as Crowley goes, screw him. We got everything we need to put him in a permanent time-out.


DEAN AND SAM WALK BACK INTO THE ROOM TO FIND ABADDON MISSING

No. No! No! No! No! She's gone. She's – son of a bitch!


SAM

PICKS A BULLET OFF THE FLOOR THAT WAS ETCHED WITH A PENTAGRAM

Dean, Dean!


[Cellphone chimes ]

SAM

It's a text message from Crowley – an address in Prosperity, Indiana.


DEAN Prosperity? Didn't we work a case there? Yeah, yeah, the one with the witches and the baked goods. So what? He's going after somebody there now?


SAM

I don't know. We got to check it out.


DEAN

Well, you know it's a trap.


SAM

Of course it's a trap. But a trap means demons, and we could use one right now.


PROSPERITY, INDIANA


[Engine shuts off ]

[Door hinges creak ]

[Light switch clicks ]


DEAN

Sam.


SAM

Is that...Jenny?


THEY FLASH BACK TO WHEN THEY SAVED HER


DEAN You were a great gal, Jenny Klein.


[Cellphone rings ]

Crowley V.O

Hey.


SAM

What the hell are you doing, Crowley?


CROWLEY

Oh, Moosie, isn't it obvious? I'm killing everyone you've ever saved – the damsels in distress, the innocent whippersnappers, the would-be vampire chow – all of them.


DEAN How do you even know –


CROWLEY

I have my sources and a cracking research team.

[Chuckles ] When you boys hit a town, you tend to leave a mess. Now, you're probably wondering why my droogs aren't in there giving you the bum's rush, so let's brass these tacks, shall we? I'm gonna gut one person every 12 hours until you bring me the Demon Tablet and stop this whole trials nonsense.


SAM

We don't have the tablet. Kevin took it and –


CROWLEY

I took Kevin. Then someone took him back. Word from the cloud is that it wasn't Heaven. So either the cutest little Prophet in the world is with you two lads, or you better find him tout-bloody-suite because time, she is a-wasting. About now, you're thinking of ways to stop me. You won't be able to, but you'll try because that's what you do. You – you try. So, time for an object lesson. Indianapolis, the Ivy Motel, room 116. You have 57 minutes.

[RECIEVER CLICKS ]


DEAN AND SAM LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND RUN TO THE MOTEL


AT ANOTHER MOTEL UNDER A TREE


METATRON

What's it gonna be, Castiel?


[Knock on door ]

SAM

Sarah.


SARAH

Sam?


[FLASHBACK] I'm Sarah Blake. I'm Sam.

What's going on?

ACT FOUR
WOMAN

I know what you are. I could see your halos.


METATRON

And we know what you are - Abomination.


WOMAN

Please, I'm not. I try to be nice. I just want to live my life.


CASTIEL

We know. I am sorry.


WOMAN

You will be.


SHE GRABS CASTIEL AND THROWS HIM AT THE FENCE, HIS BLADE IN HAND AS IT CLATTERS TO THE GROUND [CASTIEL Cries out as he Grunts and Groans ]


HER EYE'S GLOW WHITE AS SHE GRABS HIM AGAIN AND THROWS HIM AT A NEARBY DUMPSTER


[CASTIEL Cries out again and Grunts a bit in pain. breathing heavily ]


WOMAN

Having fun?


[Chuckles ]

METATRON GRABS THE LADY BY HER COLLAR AND PUNCHES HER FACE, BUT SMIRKED AS SHE GRABBED HIM AND THREW HIM OVER THE BENCH AND HIT THE FENCE


[Grunts ]

WOMAN

You want an abomination?

I'll show you an abomination.


[METATRON IS Choking as Castiel stabs her in the neck ]

[The woman Groans as the angel blade goes through her neck ]

[Body thuds ]

[Panting ]


CASTIEL HAS AN EXPRESSION OF UNCERTAINTY


INT IVY MOTEL

SARAH

So a demon named Crowley is gonna kill me in...16 minutes.


SAM

No. No, he's not.


[Knock on door ]

DEAN

Sarah, long time. [Sighs as he is lugging BAGS ]

What you doing in Indy?


[SETS STUFF ON FLOOR]

SARAH

I...was scouting an estate sale for my dad.

[Zipper unzips ]

DEAN

OH, HMM..


SAM

Look, we're gonna put Devil's Traps everywhere – the windows, the door. We've got holy water, an exorcism ready to play on a loop, and anything that comes through that door – it's meat. Look, I know this is insane, but insane is kind of what we do. We'll keep you safe.

SARAH

Okay.


DEAN

Okay? That's it?


SARAH

You've done it before.


DEAN IS SPRAYING WARDS ON THE WINDOWS


SAM

That's new.


SARAH

Yeah, I... His name is Ian. He works search and rescue. Guess I have a type. Our daughter, Bess – she'll be one in a month.


SAM

That's, uh, great. I mean it. I'm really, uh... I'm really happy for you.


SARAH

Thanks, Sam. And what about you?

SAM

Me? [Chuckles ]

Pretty much the same, I guess.


SARAH

No, you're not. You're not the same. Look, it's been years, and I can't even imagine the things you've been through. But I don't know. You just seem...more focused, confident, like... ...like you know what you want. You grew up, Sam.

[Chuckles ]

SARAH

I do miss the old haircut, though.

[Both laugh ]


[Phone rings ]

[Phone beeps ]

DEAN

Crowley.


CROWLEY

Five... Four... Trios... Zwei... ...uno.


SARAH

[Gagging ]


SAM

Sarah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Can you hear me? Sarah!


CROWLEY

She's dying, and there's nothing you can do about it.


DEAN

You son of a bitch!


CROWLEY

Son of a witch, actually. My mommy taught me a few tricks.


SAM

It's a spell. Find the hex bag.


CROWLEY

I thought of sending in a few of my bruisers, really letting them go to town. But then, well, trial one was kill a Hellhound. Trial two was rescue a soul from the pit. So, from here on, I'm gonna keep everything hell-related – demons, et cetera – away from you. Safe side and all that – plus, I just thought it seemed fitting. From what I understand, Sammy took that bird's breath away. What's the line? "Saving people, hunting things – the family business." Well, I think the people you save, they're how you justify your pathetic little lives. The alcoholism, the collateral damage, the pain you've caused – the one thing that allows you to sleep at night, the one thing is knowing that these folks are out there, still out there happy and healthy because of you, you great, big, bloody heroes!


SAM

Hey! Hey! Hey! You're gonna be okay.


CROWLEY

Sarah? They're your life's work, and I'm going to rip it apart piece by piece because I can, because you can't stop me, and because when they're all gone, what will you have left?


SAM

No. No, no, no. No. No, please, no.

[SARAH dies]

CROWLEY

You want to keep those people alive. I want complete and utter surrender. The tablet, the trials – you'll give them up, or we'll keep doing this dance. Your choice, my darlings.


[HE HANGS UP THE PHONE ]


[DEAN THROWS THE PHONE ACROSS THE ROOM AND IT BREAKS, THE HEX BAG COMES TUMBLING OUT


[Breathing heavily ]

[Breathing heavily ]

ACT FIVE
DEAN

You okay?


SAM

What do you think?


DEAN

Look, I know it's bad right now, okay, but we stick to the plan. We shut down Hell.


SAM

How, exactly?


DEAN

We get a demon –


SAM

You heard Crowley. He's not gonna let onenear us, and without a demon, all we can do is sit back and watch people we know, people we saved, die like Sarah.


DEAN

So what are you saying?


SAM

I'm saying... Maybe this isn't one we can win. Maybe we should just take the deal.


DEAN

We'll figure this out. We will. Man, we'll get it done. We'll kick it in the ass like we always do.

Are you with me?
