TEASER

INT-HOUSE-LIVING ROOM

A woman is asleep on the couch. The TV and lights start to flicker. The woman sits up, looking alarmed, and when she exhales her breath is visible. She walks to a cupboard and starts pulling out weapons as the phone rings.

VOICE ON ANSWER MACHINE
Hey, it's Olivia. I'm not in. Leave a message.

OLIVIA takes out an EMF reader, which starts beeping and flashing.

BOBBY
Olivia, it's Bobby. Call me back, would you? I got something big. I could use your help.

OLIVIA loads a gun and walks around the apartment. She hears a noise and a thin, tall man appears beside her. He is battered and bruised. She looks shocked.

OLIVIA
You!

OLIVIA fires at the ghost and he disappears. She pulls out a bag of salt and covers a doorway entrance with it. The ghost appears in front of her on the other side of the salt line.

OLIVIA
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

She backs up and turns around. A blonde, beaten woman grabs OLIVIA around the throat, strangling her. OLIVIA screams as the screen goes black.


ACT ONE

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE-DAY

BOBBY is sitting at his desk with a pile of books in front of him. SAM is sitting in a chair in the opposite corner talking to DEAN, who is standing.

SAM
Well, then tell me what else it could be.

DEAN
Look, all I know is I was not groped by an angel.

SAM
Okay, look, Dean. Why do you think this Castiel would lie to you about it?

DEAN
Maybe he's some kind of demon. Demons lie.

BOBBY looks up from his books at the boys.

SAM
A demon who's immune to salt rounds and devil's traps... and Ruby's knife? Dean, Lilith is scared of that thing!

DEAN
Don't you think that if angels were real, that some hunter somewhere would have seen one... at some point... ever?

SAM
Yeah. You just did, Dean.

DEAN
I'm trying to come up with a theory here. Okay? Work with me.

SAM
Dean, we have a theory.

DEAN
Yeah, one with a little less fairy dust on it, please.

SAM
Okay, look. I'm not saying we know for sure. I'm just saying that I think we --

DEAN
Okay, okay. That's the point. We don't know for sure, so I'm not gonna believe that this thing is a freaking Angel of the Lord because it says so!

BOBBY
You two chuckleheads want to keep arguing religion, or do you want to come take a look at this?

SAM and DEAN walk over to BOBBY'S desk.

BOBBY
I got stacks of lore -- Biblical, pre-Biblical. Some of it's in damn cuneiform. It all says an angel can snatch a soul from the pit.

DEAN
What else?

BOBBY
What else, what?

DEAN
What else could do it?

BOBBY
Airlift your ass out of the hot box? As far as I can tell, nothing.

SAM
Dean, this is good news.

DEAN
How?

SAM
Because for once, this isn't just another round of demon crap. I mean, maybe you were saved by one of the good guys, you know?

DEAN
Okay. Say it's true. Say there are angels. Then what? There's a God?

BOBBY
At this point, Vegas money's on yeah.

DEAN
I don't know, guys.

SAM
Okay, look. I know you're not all choirboy about this stuff, but this is becoming less and less about faith and more and more about proof.

DEAN
Proof?

SAM
Yes.

DEAN
Proof that there's a God out there that actually gives a crap about me personally? I'm sorry, but I'm not buying it.

SAM
Why not?

DEAN
Because why me? If there is a God out there, why would he give a crap about me?

SAM
Dean --

DEAN
I mean, I've saved some people, okay? I figured that made up for the stealing and the ditching chicks. But why do I deserve to get saved? I'm just a regular guy.

SAM
Apparently, you're a regular guy that's important to the man upstairs.

DEAN
Well, that creeps me out. I mean, I don't like getting singled out at birthday parties, much less by... God.

SAM
Okay, well, too bad, Dean, because I think he wants you to strap on your party hat.

DEAN
Fine. What do we know about angels?

BOBBY picks up a pile of fat and weighty looking books and puts them in front of DEAN.

BOBBY
Start reading.

DEAN looks at the pile of books, and turns towards SAM.

DEAN
You're gonna get me some pie.

DEAN grabs a book from the top of the pile.

EXT-DINER CAFE-DAY
The Impala pulls up to a stop. SAM is driving while on the phone.

SAM
Yes, Dean, I'll get the chips.

Dude. When have I ever forgotten the pie?

Exactly.

SAM gets out of the car and sees RUBY waiting.

SAM
I got to go.

Yeah, all right. Bye.

SAM walks over to RUBY

SAM
Ruby.

RUBY
So, is it true?

SAM
Is what true?

RUBY
Did an angel rescue Dean?

SAM
You heard.

RUBY
Who hasn't?

SAM
We're not 100% sure, but I think so.

RUBY
Okay. Bye, Sam.

RUBY starts walking away. SAM grabs her arm and turns her back to face him.

SAM
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. What's going on?

RUBY
Sam, they're angels. I'm a demon. They're not gonna care if I'm being helpful. They smite first, and then they ask questions later.

SAM
What do you know about them?

RUBY
Not much. I've never met one, and I don't really want to. All I know is that they scare the holy hell out of me. Watch yourself, Sam.

SAM
I'm not scared of angels.

RUBY walks away, leaving SAM alone.


EXT-BOBBY'S HOUSE

SAM pulls up to the house. BOBBY approaches the car window.

BOBBY
Keep the engine running.

SAM
Why? What's going on?

BOBBY
I got a friend one state over -- Olivia Lowry. I've been trying to reach her for three days on this angel thing. It's not like her to ignore this many calls.

SAM
Olivia Lowry -- a hunter, right?

BOBBY
Yeah. We're gonna go check on her. You guys follow me.

DEAN approaches the driver's side of the car, as BOBBY heads to his own car.

DEAN
Scoot over. Yeah.

DEAN grabs the bag of food SAM bought back and looks inside it.

DEAN
Dude?

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
Where's the pie?

INT OLIVIA'S HOUSE-DAY

BOBBY enters the house, armed with a gun, followed by DEAN and SAM who are also armed. They search for OLIVIA.

BOBBY
Olivia?

They see OLVIA dead and covered in blood on the floor. BOBBY walks away, out of the room.

DEAN
Bobby?

SAM
(pointing to the doorway) Salt line.

SAM and DEAN look around the room.

DEAN
(picking up the EMF reader) Olivia was rocking the EMF meter.

SAM
(nodding) Spirit activity.

DEAN
Yeah -- on steroids. I never seen a ghost do this to a person.

BOBBY enters the room again, his phone in his hand.

DEAN
Bobby, you all right?

BOBBY
I called some hunters nearby...

DEAN
Good. We can use their help.

BOBBY
...except they ain't answering their phones either.

SAM
Something's up, huh?

BOBBY
You think?

BOBBY walks out of the room and SAM and DEAN look concerned.

EXT WHITE COUNTRY HOUSE-DAY

Phone rings, an answering machine picks up.

INT WHITE COUNTRY HOUSE-DAY

MALE VOICE
Yeah, this is Jed. I'm not around. Uh, leave a message.

DEAN (V.O.)
Jed, Dean Winchester again -- friend of Bobby Singer's. Look, we think something's happening. We think it's happening to hunters. Just want to make sure you're okay. Call me back.

As Dean is speaking into the machine, we see the house interior - blood, broken glass, salt thrown on the floor, a gun lying beside a body, which is bloody and has had its chest ripped out.


ACT TWO

EXT WHITE HOUSE- NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are walking down the stairs, exiting the house. DEAN is on the phone.

DEAN.
We're in Jackson. It's not pretty. He looks even worse than Olivia. What about you?

BOBBY, in his car, driving, also on the phone.

BOBBY
R.C. I checked on Carl Bates and R.C. Adams. They've redecorated... in red.

DEAN
What the hell is going on here, Bobby? Why did a bunch of ghosts suddenly want to gank off-duty hunters?

BOBBY
I don't know, but until we find out, you guys better get your asses to my place.

DEAN
We're on our way.

DEAN and SAM are driving, and pull up to a stop at a service station. The car stops, and SAM puts the gas pump in the car. SAM walks to the restroom while the gas is pumping. DEAN is asleep in the passenger seat of the car. SAM is washing his hands in the bathroom, when he breathes out his breath is visible. The bathroom mirror covers with foggy mist, which SAM wipes away with his hand. He is startled to see HENRIKSEN's reflection.

HENRIKSEN
Hi, Sam. It's been a while.

SAM flashes back to the last time they saw HENRIKSEN in 3.12 Jus in Bello.

HENRIKSEN
Hi, guys. It's been a while. So, how do we survive?

SAM
Henriksen. Are you -- Did you...

HENRIKSEN
I didn't survive... if that's what you're asking.

SAM
I'm sorry.

HENRIKSEN
I know you are.

SAM Look, if we'd known Lilith was coming --

HENRIKSEN
You wouldn't have left half a dozen innocent people in that police station to die in your place. You did this to me. It was your fault. She was after you, and I paid the price. You left us there to die!

HENRIKSEN attacks SAM, grabbing him hard, and throwing him around. SAM notices a small brand on HENRIKSEN's hand. SAM is thrown against the mirrors and HENRIKSEN knocks SAM's head on the sink. SAM falls to the ground. DEAN enters and shoots at HENRIKSEN, whose ghost disappears.

INT-BOBBY'S HOUSE-NIGHT

Lights flicker and BOBBY'S breath becomes visible. He hears laughter and walks towards the noise, grabbing an iron poker from the fireplace. The lights flicker and the radio starts playing up. BOBBY watched as a ball bounces down the stairs. When it stops at the bottom he turns and sees two small girls, very much alike, staring at him.

EXT ROAD, IMPALA-NIGHT

DEAN is driving, on the phone. SAM is in the passenger seat with bruises on his face.

DEAN
(looking at his phone) Damn it, Bobby! Pick up!

(to SAM) How you feeling, huh? How many fingers am I holding up?

SAM
None. I'll be fine, Dean.

DEAN
Henriksen?

SAM
Yep.

DEAN
Why? What did he want?

SAM
Revenge, 'cause we got him killed.

DEAN
Sam.

SAM
Well, we did, Dean.

DEAN
All right. Stop right there. Whatever the hell is going on, it's happening to us now, okay? I can't get ahold of Bobby, so if you're not thinking answers, don't think at all.

INT BOBBY'S HOUSE-DAY

DEAN and SAM enter the house, guns cocked and ready.

DEAN
Bobby?

They find the iron poker on the ground.

DEAN
(gestures to the stairs) I'll go. You check outside.

SAM walks through the junkyard. BOBBY is in a car with the two girls, who are keeping him quiet.

SAM
Bobby? Bobby?

DEAN is upstairs, searching.

DEAN
Bobby?
A door opens, slowly, no one is visible.

DEAN
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

A YOUNG WOMAN with shoulder-length brown hair appears behind him. .

YOUNG WOMAN
Dean Winchester. Still so bossy. You don't recognize me?

DEAN flashes back to MEG when she was blonde and possessed.

MEG
This is what I looked like before that demon cut off my hair and dressed me like a slut.

DEAN flashes back again to MEG when she was blonde and possessed.

DEAN
Meg?

MEG
Hi. It's okay, I'm not a demon.


ACT THREE

INT BOBBY'S HOUSE-DAY

MEG
It's okay, I'm not a demon.

DEAN
You're the girl the demon possessed.

MEG
Meg Masters. Nice to finally talk to you when I'm not, you know, choking on my own blood. (MEG holds up her hands) It's okay. Seriously, I'm just a college girl. Sorry -- was. I was walking home one night and got jumped by all this smoke. Next thing you know, I'm a prisoner... (puts a hand to her head) in here. Now, I was awake. I had to watch while she murdered people.

DEAN
I'm sorry.

MEG
Oh, yeah? So sorry you had me thrown off a building?

DEAN
Well, we thought --

MEG
No, you didn't think! I kept waiting, praying! I was trapped in there screaming at you! "Just help me, please!" You're supposed to help people, Dean. Why didn't you help me?

DEAN
I'm sorry.

MEG
Stop saying you're sorry!

MEG slaps DEAN and knocks him to the floor.

DEAN
Meg. Meg...

MEG kicks DEAN.

DEAN
We didn't know.

MEG
No... You just attacked. Did you ever think there was a girl in here? No. You just charged in, slashing and burning. You think you're some kind of hero?

DEAN
No, I don't.

MEG grabs hold of DEAN's jacket. Her hand has a brand on it.

MEG
You're damn right. Do you have any idea what it's like to be ridden for months by pure evil... while your family has no idea what happened to you?

DEAN
We did the best we could.

MEG shoves DEAN and kicks him again.

INT CAR-DAY

The girls still hold BOBBY captive.

GIRL ONE
Are you scared, Bobby?

GIRL TWO
We were scared, Bobby.

GIRL ONE
When the monster came for us... and grabbed us tight.

GIRL TWO
And we couldn't even scream. You were right there, Bobby.

GIRL ONE
You were in the house.

GIRL TWO
You were so close.

SAM is outside searching for Bobby. His breath becomes visible.

SAM
Bobby?

GIRL TWO
You could have saved us, Bobby.

SAM
We're here, Bobby?

GIRL ONE
You walked right past that door.

GIRL TWO
The monster had us. And you didn't find us.

GIRL ONE
And now they won't find you.

INT BOBBY'S HOUSE-UPPER FLOOR-DAY

DEAN is still on the floor, MEG standing over him.

MEG
It wasn't just me, Dean. I had a sister. A little sister. She worshipped me. You know how little siblings are, right? How they'll do anything for you. She was never the same after I disappeared. She just... she just got lost. And when my body was lying in the morgue beat-up and broken...

DEAN
Meg.

MEG
Do you know what that did to her? She killed herself! (kicks Dean in the stomach) Because of you, Dean! Because all you were thinking about was your family, your revenge, and your demons! 50 words of Latin a little sooner, and I'd still be alive. My baby sister would still be alive. That blood is on your hands, Dean!

DEAN
You're right.

MEG kicks at DEAN again.

EXT-CAR YARD-DAY

SAM spots a reflection and works his way up a pile of cars towards BOBBY.

SAM
Bobby! Hold on, Bobby! I'm coming! Bobby!

SAM uses a crowbar to pry open the doors to the car where BOBBY is being held. The GIRLS push him backwards and he lands on another car below, bleeding. One of the GIRLS jumps on him. SAM uses the crowbar to fight her, while BOBBY does the same with the other girl. The GIRLS disappear.

INT HOUSE-DAY

DEAN is still on the ground. He takes out a gun and aims it at MEG.

MEG
Come on, Dean, did your brain get french-fried in Hell? You can't shoot me with bullets.

DEAN
I'm not shooting you.

DEAN aims his gun and shoots at the ceiling. A chandelier falls and lands on MEG.

DEAN
Iron.

INT HOUSE

DEAN, SAM and BOBBY are in the study.

SAM
So, they're all people we know?

DEAN
Not just know. People we couldn't save. Hey, I saw something on Meg. Did she have a tattoo when she was alive?

SAM
I don't think so.

DEAN
It was like a-a mark on her hand -- almost like a brand.

SAM
I saw a mark, too, on Henriksen.

BOBBY
What did it look like?

SAM
Uh, paper? (takes offered paper and starts sketching the mark) Thanks.

SAM holds the drawing up for DEAN to compare.

DEAN
That's it.

BOBBY
I may have seen this before. We got to move.

SAM
Whoa.

BOBBY
Follow me.

SAM
Okay, where are we going?

BOBBY
Some place safe, you idiot.

BOBBY picks up some books and leads SAM and DEAN to a basement room, which is made entirely of iron and covered with pentagrams and Devil's traps.

SAM
Bobby, is this...

BOBBY
Solid iron. Completely coated in salt. 100% ghost-proof.

SAM
You built a panic room?

BOBBY
I had a weekend off.

DEAN
Bobby.

BOBBY
What?

DEAN
You're awesome. Oh. (sees a poster of a swimsuit model)

SAM and DEAN are making iron (salt?) bullets.

DEAN
See, this is why I can't get behind God.

SAM
What are you talking about?

DEAN
If he doesn't exist, fine. Bad crap happens to good people. That's how it is. There's no rhyme or reason -- just random, horrible, evil -- I get it, okay. I can roll with that. But if he is out there, what's wrong with him? Where the hell is he while all these decent people are getting torn to shreds? How does he live with himself? You know, why doesn't he help?

BOBBY
I ain't touching this one with at 10-foot pole.

DEAN
Yeah.

BOBBY
Found it.

SAM
What?

BOBBY
The symbol you saw -- the brand on the ghosts...

SAM
Yeah?

BOBBY
Mark of the Witness.

SAM
Witness? Witness to what?

BOBBY
The unnatural. None of them died what you'd call ordinary deaths. See, these ghosts -- they were forced to rise. They woke up in agony. They were like rabid dogs. It ain't their fault. Someone rose them... on purpose.

SAM
Who?

BOBBY
Do I look like I know? But whoever it was used a spell so powerful it left a mark, a brand on their souls. Whoever did this had big plans. It's called "the rising of the witnesses." It figures into an ancient prophecy.

DEAN
Wait, wait. What -- what book is that prophecy from?

BOBBY
Well, the widely distributed version's just for tourists, you know. But long story short -- Revelations. This is a sign, boys.

SAM and DEAN
A sign of what?

BOBBY
The apocalypse.

ACT FOUR

INT HOUSE-PANIC ROOM
DEAN
Apocalypse? The apocalypse, apocalypse? The four horsemen, pestilence, $5-a-gallon-gas apocalypse?

BOBBY
That's the one. The rise of the witnesses is a -- a mile marker.

SAM
Okay, so, what do we do now?

DEAN
Road trip. Grand Canyon, Star Trek Experience. Bunny Ranch.

BOBBY
First things first. How about we survive our friends out there?

DEAN
Great. Any ideas aside from staying in this room until Judgment Day?

BOBBY
It's a spell (indicates the paper in front of him) to send the witnesses back to rest. Should work.

SAM
Should. Great.

BOBBY
If I translate it correctly. I think I got everything we need here at the house.

DEAN
Any chance you got everything we need here in this room?

BOBBY
So, you thought our luck was gonna start now all of a sudden? Spell's got to be cast over an open fire.

SAM
The fireplace in the library.

BOBBY
Bingo.

DEAN
That's just not as appealing as a, uh, ghost-proof panic room, you know?

SAM, DEAN and BOBBY prepare to leave the panic room.

BOBBY
Cover each other. And aim careful. Don't run out of ammo until I'm done, or they'll shred you. Ready?

They make their way out of the room, and head towards the stairs. A ghost sits on the stairs, a young man in his early 20s with curly hair.

RONALD
Hey, Dean. You remember me?

DEAN flashes back to RONALD being shot in 2.12 Nightshifter.

RONALD (FLASHBACK)
Everybody on the floor now! He's got the laser eyes.

DEAN
Ronald, huh? With the laser eyes? I wish I could say it's good to see you.

RONALD
I am dead because of you. You were supposed to help me!

BOBBY shoots at RONALD.

BOBBY
If you're gonna shoot, shoot. Don't talk.

SAM, DEAN and BOBBY make their way to the living room. SAM creates a salt circle and DEAN starts the fire.

BOBBY (to SAM) Upstairs, linen closet -- red hex box. It'll be heavy.

SAM
Got it.

The two girls appear in the living room again.

GIRL ONE
Bobby.

DEAN shoots at the girls.

BOBBY
Kitchen. Cutlery drawer. It's got a false bottom. Hemlock, opium, wormwood.

DEAN
Opium?

BOBBY
Go!

The girls reappear as DEAN leaves for the kitchen. BOBBY is drawing with chalk on the desk and tries to focus on this while the girls are there.

GIRL ONE
Bobby. You walked right by us while that monster ate us all up.

GIRL TWO
You could have saved us.

BOBBY picks up his gun and shoots at the girls.

Upstairs, SAM finds the red box in the cupboard.

MEG
You know what really pisses me off, Sam?

SAM turns around, sees MEG and fires at her.

MEG
You saw how I suffered for months. I thought you must have learned something. I thought I died for something.

SAM
Meg.

MEG
But what you're doing with that demon, Ruby... How many innocent bodies has Ruby burned through for kicks? How many girls just like me? And you don't send her back to Hell? You're a monster!

SAM raises his rifle and shoots MEG.

DEAN is in the kitchen looking for the false bottom in the drawer. The doors to the kitchen close suddenly.

BOBBY
Dean?

DEAN
I'm all right, Bobby! Keep working!

HENRIKSEN appears next to DEAN.

DEAN
Victor.

HENRIKSEN
Dean.

DEAN
I know.

HENRIKSEN
No. You don't.

DEAN
It's my fault you're dead. I left you behind. And the minute I heard about that explosion, I thought, "I should have known." I should have protected you.

DEAN reaches for a gun behind him, but it goes flying across the room.

HENRIKSEN
Unh-unh. Not so fast. You think you left and Lilith came and we all died in a beautiful blast of... white light? If only. 45 minutes.

DEAN
What?

HENRIKSEN
Over 45 minutes. Lilith said she wanted to have some fun. The secretary was first. Remember her? Nancy, the virgin. Lilith filleted Nancy's skin off piece by piece. Right in front of us, made us watch. Nancy never stopped screaming.

DEAN
No.

HENRIKSEN
I was the last.

DEAN
Victor...

HENRIKSEN reaches inside DEAN's chest and grips his heart.

HENRIKSEN
Tell me how it's fair. You get saved from Hell -- I die. Why do you deserve another chance, Dean?

SAM enters and shoots HENRIKSEN, rushing to check on DEAN as soon as HENRIKSEN is gone.

SAM
You all right?

DEAN
No.

SAM
Let's go.

SAM helps DEAN up and he and DEAN carry the hex box and other ingredients to the library.

RONALD appears again as DEAN is reloading his gun.

DEAN
Ronald. Hey, come on, man. I thought we were pals.

RONALD
That's when I was breathing. Now I'm gonna eat you alive.

DEAN
Well...come on, I'm not a cheeseburger.

DEAN cocks his gun and points it at RONALD, but RONALD has vanished. BOBBY recites some Latin words and the windows blow open and a wind fills the room. The wind moves the salt so they are no longer protected by it. MEG appears and SAM quickly shoots at her, as BOBBY continues to recite the spell. RONALD appears and they shoot at him. SAM and DEAN continue to fire as the ghosts appear. HENRIKSEN knocks DEAN'S gun out of his hands when he is reloading, and approaches him. DEAN grabs another gun, and shoots it, only to find it empty. He quickly picks up an iron rod and hits at HENRIKSEN. MEG appears and pushes SAM against the wall, trapping him there with a desk. SAM tries to push the desk away without success.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM
Cover Bobby!

BOBBY continues to recite the spell and SAM keeps trying to get out from behind the desk. The two GIRLS are sitting on the desk waiting. MEG plunges a hand into BOBBY's back. BOBBY drops the bowl with spell ingredients.

BOBBY
Dean! (DEAN catches the bowl) Fireplace!

DEAN throws the bowl in the fire, which turns blue. The ghosts all disappear. BOBBY falls to the ground.

DEAN
Bobby?

SAM pushes the desk away, freeing himself.

DEAN and SAM help BOBBY up. He nods, indicating he is okay.


ACT FIVE

INT BOBBY'S HOUSE-NIGHT

SAM is asleep on the couch. Dean is asleep on the floor nearby and wakes up to find CASTIEL standing in the kitchen. DEAN checks on SAM, sees he is asleep, and walks over to join CASTIEL.

CASTIEL
Excellent job with the witnesses.

DEAN
You were hip to all this?

CASTIEL
I was, uh, made aware.

DEAN
Well, thanks a lot for the angelic assistance. You know, I almost got my heart ripped out of my chest.

CASTIEL
But you didn't.

DEAN
I thought angels were supposed to be guardians. Fluffy wings, halos -- you know, Michael Landon. Not dicks.

CASTIEL
Read the Bible. Angels are warriors of God. I'm a soldier.

DEAN
Yeah? Then, why didn't you fight?

CASTIEL
I'm not here to perch on your shoulder. We had larger concerns.

DEAN
Concerns? There were people getting torn to shreds down here! And, by the way, while all this is going on, where the hell is your boss, huh, if there is a God?

CASTIEL
There's a God.

DEAN
I'm not convinced. 'Cause if there's a God, what the hell is he waiting for, huh? Genocide? Monsters roaming the earth? The freaking apocalypse? At what point does he lift a damn finger and help the poor bastards that are stuck down here?

CASTIEL
The Lord works...

DEAN
If you say "mysterious ways," so help me, I will kick your ass. So, Bobby was right... about the witnesses. This is some kind of a... sign of the apocalypse.

CASTIEL
That's why we're here. Big things afoot.

DEAN
Do I want to know what kind of things?

CASTIEL
I sincerely doubt it, but you need to know. The rising of the witnesses is one of the 66 seals.

DEAN
Okay. I'm guessing that's not a show at Seaworld.

CASTIEL
Those seals are being broken by Lilith.

DEAN
She did the spell. She rose the witnesses.

CASTIEL
Mm-hmm. And not just here. 20 other hunters are dead.

DEAN
Of course. She picked victims that the hunters couldn't save so that they would barrel right after us.

CASTIEL
Lilith has a certain sense of humor.

DEAN
Well, we put those spirits back to rest.

CASTIEL
It doesn't matter. The seal was broken.

DEAN
Why break the seal anyway?

CASTIEL
You think of the seals as locks on a door.

DEAN
Okay. Last one opens and...

CASTIEL
Lucifer walks free.

DEAN Lucifer? But I thought Lucifer was just a story they told at demon Sunday school. There's no such thing.

CASTIEL
Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me. Why do you think we're here walking among you now for the first time in 2,000 years?

DEAN
To stop Lucifer.

CASTIEL
That's why we've arrived.

DEAN
Well... bang-up job so far. Stellar work with the witnesses. That's nice.

CASTIEL
We tried. And there are other battles, other seals. Some we'll win, some we'll lose. This one we lost. Our numbers are not unlimited. Six of my brothers died in the field this week. You think the armies of Heaven should just follow you around? There's a bigger picture here. You should show me some respect. I dragged you out of Hell. I can throw you back in.

CASTIEL vanishes, leaving DEAN alone in the kitchen. Later DEAN wakes up. SAM is already awake and up and about.

SAM
You all right? What's wrong, Dean?

DEAN
So... You got no problem believing in... God and Angels?

SAM
No, not really.

DEAN
So, I guess that means that you believe in the Devil.

SAM
Why are you asking me all this?
