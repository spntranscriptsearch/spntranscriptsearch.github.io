Just relax.


DEAN
Where am I?

You're at the hospital.


DEAN
Which one?


DOCTOR
Sioux Falls General.


A nurse gives DEAN a shot.


DEAN
Where's my brother? We got to go.

He bashed his head quite seriously. He's gone up for an MRI.


DEAN
Okay. I got to go.


DOCTOR
You're not going anywhere on this leg, buddy. Relax.


DEAN blacks out.


INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – PATIENT ROOM – DAY


DEAN
Oh, no, no, no.


DEAN pulls a drip out of his arm and tries to get up, but falls to the floor with a yell. His right leg is in a cast.


DEAN
What?


BOBBY enters the room.


BOBBY
You okay?


DEAN
Bobby, you're alive.


BOBBY
'Course I am. Why are you on the floor?


DEAN
They gave me morphine. A lot.


BOBBY helps DEAN up.


DEAN
Hey, look, a monster broke my leg. Oh. Wait... the house. We thought you were dead.


BOBBY
Well, I ain't. Not yet. But we got to run. This place ain't safe. Where's Sam?


DEAN
Uh... Head scan, I think.


BOBBY
Meet me at the ambulance dock, stat. I'll find Sam.


DEAN
Wait, where? Bobby, I'm a gimp.


BOBBY brings DEAN crutches.


BOBBY
Hey.


BOBBY pats DEAN’s cheek several times and smiles at him.


INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – DAY


DR GAINES is washing his hands. The NURSE from 7.02 Hello, Cruel World hands him a towel.


DR GAINES
You've scheduled dessert, I presume?


DR GAINES’ phone rings. The NURSE takes it out of his gown pocket and holds it to his ear.


DR GAINES
Yes? The Winchesters?


DEAN exits his hospital room on crutches. BOBBY approaches an orderly who is moving an unconscious SAM on a stretcher, and holds up some ID.


BOBBY
Hold the phone there, son. Who's this?


BOBBY looks at the chart on SAM’s stretcher.


BOBBY
Yeah, this is the guy. Coverage lapsed. We're shipping him to County.


BOBBY [to unconscious SAM]
Come on, sicko. Let's get you healed up some place a little safer.


DR GAINES and the NURSE stride purposefully down the hallway as DEAN makes his way on crutches. BOBBY pushes SAM on the stretcher. DR GAINES sees DEAN’s empty room. BOBBY and SAM leave the hospital via the ambulance entrance and BOBBY puts SAM’s stretcher in an ambulance.


BOBBY
Come on, Dean.


Through the ambulance side mirror, BOBBY sees DR GAINES and the NURSE come out of the ambulance entrance door.


BOBBY
Balls. Come on, Dean. Come on, Dean!


DEAN gets in the passenger seat of the ambulance.


DEAN
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!


BOBBY accelerates away. DR GAINES and the NURSE run after the ambulance for a short distance. DR GAINES takes out his phone.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
INT. CABIN – DAY

Whitefish, Montana
Three weeks later


SAM is reading at the table and DEAN watching television. On the screen, a woman is crying over a man’s body. BOBBY enters.


DEAN
Dude... Ricardo.


BOBBY
What happened?


DEAN
Suicidio.


BOBBY
Adiós, ese.


DEAN looks very moved at what has happened on the screen.


BOBBY
Well, this ought to cheer you up.


DEAN
My baby! Now I just got to get this stupid thing off and I can drive again.


SAM
So how is it out there?


BOBBY
Weird with a side order of bloody. Talked to a few hunters. They're running into the same kind of thing that set up shop at that hospital.


DEAN
Yeah, and don't forget tried to kill us at your place.


BOBBY
Well, consensus is they're, um, they're like shapeshifters only a lot more into eating folk. And nothing can kill 'em.


DEAN
Good times. Anything else?


BOBBY
Yep. They bleed black goo.


SAM
Like that stuff that came out of Cas – those things from Purgatory. Uh... Leviathan.


BOBBY
Yep.


DEAN
What about those chompers that you and the sheriff saw at the hospital? They still making spleenburgers?


BOBBY
Yeah, made some calls. That doctor never showed back up to work. Ditto a nurse and some administrator.


SAM starts to hear voices in his head.


LUCIFER (in SAM’s mind)
You never left, Sam.


DEAN
So they could be at any hospital in America.


BOBBY
Yeah.


LUCIFER (in SAM’s mind)
You're still in the Cage... with me.


DEAN
What do you think, Sammy? Sammy? Sam.


LUCIFER (in SAM’s mind)
Sam...


DEAN
Hey, ground control! Sam!


SAM turns over his left palm and we see the healed wound on his hand.


SAM
Yeah. What? I'm – I'm right here.


DEAN
You okay?


SAM
Yeah. I'm fine.


There is a long pause.


BOBBY
Good. Every last bit of info I ever had burned down, so...


DEAN
What about this place? Rufus leave anything? Did you check the basement?


BOBBY
C-rations and dust. I don't think he'd been here in years. So, I got to go round up my old library.


SAM
I thought you said most of those books were one-of-a-kind.


BOBBY
Yeah. That's why I stashed copies all over the place.


DEAN
Okay, good. Um... Hey, uh, two-legs. We're fresh out of grub. Want to make a run?


SAM
Sure. Yeah.


DEAN tosses SAM the keys to the IMPALA.


DEAN
Be careful with her, would you? And, uh, Sam?


SAM
Yeah?


DEAN
Pie.


SAM
Obviously.


SAM leaves.


DEAN
So?


BOBBY
So what?


DEAN
Before you bail again – "Girl, Interrupted" over there. Any thoughts?


BOBBY
Looks to me like he's doing better.


DEAN
Better? What do you mean, better? You just saw him!


BOBBY
Saw him check out once. That's progress.


DEAN
You're kidding!


BOBBY
Look, seems to me that Sam's head ain't no different than your leg. People heal on a curve.


DEAN
Not diff– Bobby, I get this thing off in five days, I'm golden. Sam's not a curve. He's a frickin' time bomb.


BOBBY
It ain't like he's keeping secrets. What you see is what you get. What's so nuts about calling an upswing?


DEAN
Because that's not how it works, Bobby, ever! All right? Especially not with Sam. The other shoe is gonna drop. It's just a matter of when.


BOBBY
Okay. How 'bout we worry about today's problems? And today, we need intel. I'm going. You sit there and stew. I'll check in. Look... you sitting here wringing your hands ain't gonna do nothing. Maybe he'll surprise you.


BOBBY leaves.

Uh, yeah. Yeah, please. Here.

INT. OFFICE – DAY


A MAN is sitting in front of a computer screen and talking on the phone using a headset.

Yes, sir. Do you see any other strange charges on your statement? The May 27th charge to "Mistress Magda," perhaps? Oh. Sorry for asking.


A transaction alert flashes up on his computer screen saying that Lemmy Kilmister has used his card at the Whitefish Gas n’ Sip.

Great.


MAN (on phone)
A shop in Montana, about a day and a half, maybe two days from here.

SAM
Fine.


DEAN
I mean, you still, you know...


SAM
Yeah, no, I – I know what you mean. Yeah, I'm – I'm still seeing crap that's not real. But, yeah, I'm fine. I mean, I can tell the difference.


DEAN
Think it's getting better?


SAM
Honestly? Uh... I don't know. I just know I'm managing it, so... So don't worry.


DEAN
Where's the pie?


SAM
I got cake. It's close enough, right?


Some time later, DEAN is asleep on the couch. SAM is reading an article in the newspaper, titled “Victim's fatal wounds ‘signature’ of killer”.


FLASHBACK: EXT. LINCOLN, NEBRASKA, 1998 – DAY


YOUNG SAM is reading a newspaper on a bench and talking on the phone.


YOUNG SAM (on phone)
Yeah, so, from what I can tell, it's something called a Kitsune. Not much. They... look human... till they sprout out claws and stab you behind your ear to get to your brain. I don't – I don't know yet. Yes, Dean, I realize killing 'em's important. Maybe if Uncle Bobby sent a book in English. I am! No, no, don't – don't put him on the phone. Hi, Dad. Yes, sir. I realize people are dying. Yeah, I'm on my way to the library right now.


INT. RUFUS’ CABIN – DAY


SAM leaves a note for DEAN on the table next to the uneaten cake, takes the keys to the IMPALA and leaves.


EXT. UNDER A BRIDGE – NIGHT


LONG-HAIRED MAN
Sorry, honey. Price went up. Fifty-five.


WOMAN
Oh, I don't – I don't have it.


LONG-HAIRED MAN
That's too bad. Maybe we can make a little trade. Hmm?


At the sound of police sirens, they hurry away in opposite directions. The MAN hears a noise and stops, but sees nothing and then continues on his way. Someone tackles him to the ground.


LONG-HAIRED MAN
Aah!


The MAN lies on ground, dead. Blood pools from the back of his head.

Other who?


The scene alternates between DEAN in RUFUS’ cabin and BOBBY at the gas station.


DEAN (on phone)
Sam. He took off.


BOBBY (on phone)
Where?


DEAN (on phone)
I don't know. Nowhere good.


BOBBY (on phone)
Well, maybe he needed a little "me-time."


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah, but his me-time ain't just him. I mean, for all we know he's road trippin' with Lucifer somewhere. Left me here like Jimmy friggin' Stewart.


BOBBY (on phone)
I assume you called.


DEAN (on phone)
Straight to voicemail. He turned his GPS off, too.


DEAN (on phone)
And he took my car!


BOBBY (on phone)
Don't panic.


DEAN (on phone)
Too late!


BOBBY (on phone)
Look, he says he's okay, so give it a couple of days. Just till you get the cast off, then hunt him down. Till then, we'll both just keep calling.


DEAN (on phone)
All right.


INT. RUFUS’ CABIN – DAY

You're goin' down.

INT. POLICE STATION – DAY


SAM
You guys thinking this is another one – so-called ice pick killer?


POLICE OFFICER
Same M.O. Can't say I'm too broken up about this one.


SAM
Oh, you knew him?


POLICE OFFICER
Busted him half a dozen times. Real mensch.


SAM
So, what's the deal? Um, killer comes to town, ganks a lowlife, moves along?


POLICE OFFICER
Looks like.


SAM
Stabs 'em all exactly the same, right? Behind the ear?


POLICE OFFICER
Yeah. No explaining a psycho. We left that detail out of the paper, though. How'd you know?


SAM
I worked a case like this a few years back.


POLICE OFFICER
Think it's related?


SAM
You find anything weird about the brains?


POLICE OFFICER
Like what?


SAM
Like... missing.


POLICE OFFICER
Huh. Good question for the coroner.


SAM
Right. Thanks.


SAM’s phone beeps. He takes it out of his pocket and sees that he has had three missed calls from “Lars Ulrich”.


INT. WHITEFISH MT GAS & SIP STORE – DAY


DEAN
How you doing? Uh, was there a, uh, big guy in here yesterday?


CLERK
That's specific.


DEAN
Uh, I mean big. Like about yea high?

Yeah, maybe. Uh, brown hair?


DEAN
Yes! Yes. That's him. Do you, uh – you remember what he bought?


CLERK
Snacks, maybe?


DEAN
How about a paper? Do you have yesterday's paper?


CLERK
Yeah, right there.


DEAN
Oh.


DEAN picks up the newspaper and sees the ice pick killer headline.


DEAN
Do you mind?


DEAN walks out with the newspaper.


INT. CORONER’S ROOM – DAY


CORONER
We don't get too many murders out this way... much less a serial.


SAM
So what'd you find?


CORONER
It's what we didn't find. Let me show you. Big chunk of mid-brain went missing.


SAM
Mid-brain, like pituitary gland?


CORONER
Actually, their pituitaries were clear gone. How'd you know that?


FLASHBACK: INT. LIBRARY – DAY


YOUNG SAM is sitting at a table with a book, talking on the phone.


YOUNG SAM (on phone)
Yeah, so, they need a steady diet of human pituitary glands to survive.


INT. CORONER’S ROOM – DAY


SAM
Educated guess.


INT. SAM’S MOTEL ROOM – DAY


SAM is hanging his research on the wall and marking locations on a map.


FLASHBACK: INT. LIBRARY – DAY


YOUNG SAM (on phone)
Hang on. Slow down.


YOUNG SAM is sitting at a desk, marking locations on a map.


YOUNG SAM (on phone)
Right. So, the victims are located in parks just off the highway. Just one per town. That's something. What? I – I'm just tired. I've been looking at this for like eight years. Wait. Hang on. I'll call you right back.


YOUNG SAM hangs up and draws a line on his map between the Xs.

You stab it in the heart. Stab it. The heart. I said, you stab it in the heart!


LIBRARIAN
Shh!


YOUNG SAM (on phone)
Okay. Are you guys cool? Can I have a normal life for five minutes now? Oh, Dean. Quick question. How do you talk to girls?


YOUNG SAM straightens his jacket and approaches the BLONDE GIRL, who is sitting at a table. She is wearing a necklace with a crescent moon pendant.


YOUNG SAM
Um... I just wanted to, you know, say hi and –


BLONDE GIRL
No. Go away. It's just, I'm not supposed to talk to boys.


YOUNG SAM nods and turns to leave.


FLASHBACK: EXT. OUTSIDE LANCASTER PUBLIC LIBRARY – DAY


YOUNG SAM leaves the library, as does the BLONDE GIRL a few moments later. She walks away and is followed by two boys. YOUNG SAM follows them.


BLONDE GIRL
Leave me alone.


BOY 1
Come on. We just want to talk.


BLONDE GIRL
I have to go.


BOY 2 puts a hand on the BLONDE GIRL’s shoulder and pushes her against a tree.


BOY 1
Uh-uh-uh. Why so rude?


BLONDE GIRL
Don't touch me!


BOY 1
Hey. I said be nice.


YOUNG SAM
Why don't you?


BOY 1
Butt out. Can you believe this guy?


BOY 1 puts out a hand to shove YOUNG SAM. YOUNG SAM blocks it and punches him. BOY 2 punches YOUNG SAM. YOUNG SAM punches BOY 2, then hits BOY 1 again and shoves BOY 2 as the BOYS leave.


YOUNG SAM
Hi. I'm Sam.


BLONDE GIRL
I'm Amy.


EXT. WOODS – NIGHT


SAM is following a WOMAN who is walking through the woods. The WOMAN watches a MAN who is standing next to his car fumbling with his car keys. He drops the keys.


MAN
Oh, damn it.


SAM comes up behind the WOMAN. She turns and SAM holds a knife to her chest. The camera focuses on her crescent pendant.


SAM
Hi, Amy.


ACT THREE
EXT. WOODS – NIGHT


AMY
Sam. Wow.


SAM
Yeah.


AMY
I just... never thought I'd see you again. What are you doing here?


SAM
I think you know.


AMY
You got tall, huh?


SAM
Small talk? Really? Let’s take a walk.


AMY
Sam –


SAM
Walk.


They walk, SAM holding a knife to AMY’s chest.


SAM
So, same pattern, same victim pool – just like when we were kids.


AMY
No, I – it's not what – look, I'm not – I've had the same job for the last six years. I – I have a house, two cats, a mortgage. I have a normal life.


SAM
You call this normal?


FLASHBACK: INT. YOUNG AMY’S HOUSE – DAY


The Goo Goo Dolls' "Two Days in February" plays.


YOUNG AMY
Ready to play doctor?


YOUNG SAM is sitting on the couch. YOUNG AMY dabs at his face.


YOUNG AMY
So, you gonna tell me?


YOUNG SAM
What?


YOUNG AMY
How you kicked the crap out of those guys. I mean... no offense, but you're kind of...


YOUNG SAM
Wiry?


YOUNG AMY
Exactly. So...?


YOUNG SAM
Just watch a lot of Bruce Lee movies.


YOUNG AMY
You thirsty?


YOUNG SAM
Sure.


YOUNG AMY opens the refrigerator, which contains jars holding brains. She moves a jar and takes out a can of soda.


YOUNG AMY
So, you live around here?


YOUNG SAM
No, not really. It's a cool song. My dad doesn't listen to anything recorded after 1979, so...


YOUNG SAM holds the can of soda to his face.


YOUNG AMY
Does that mean you can't?


YOUNG SAM
I'm kind of stuck in the car a lot. My dad has to travel. For work.


YOUNG AMY
Yeah, me and my mom bounce around a lot, too. She's all about, like, "Letting the wind be our guide."


YOUNG SAM
Like a hippie?


YOUNG AMY
Minus the peace and love.


YOUNG AMY takes the can from YOUNG SAM, opens it, takes a drink and hands it back to him.


YOUNG SAM
We're always on the road. I mean, I've seen the world's biggest ball of twine twice.


YOUNG AMY
Three times. Not that big.


YOUNG SAM
Right?


They laugh.


YOUNG SAM
Okay, but be honest – I mean, moving all the time sucks. You're always the new kid, and everyone always thinks you're a freak.


YOUNG AMY
Sam, you are a freak. But so was, I don't know, Jimi Hendrix and... Picasso. So am I. All the coolest people are freaks.


YOUNG SAM leans forward and they kiss.


EXT. WOODS – NIGHT


AMY
Sam. What I am, I'm managing it.


SAM
You spiked three guys this week.


AMY
No, you don't understand. It's not like that. I'm – I'm not just some murderer. I had to.


SAM
Why?


AMY
I can't – I just had to. Please believe me, Sam.


SAM
I can't. I'm sorry.


SAM reaches into AMY’s pocket with his left hand.


AMY
So am I.

INT. CORONER’S ROOM – DAY


CORONER
This is the one he asked to see.


DEAN
Great, great. Uh, let me ask you, did he do anything to it?


CORONER
No. He just asked a few questions about the other vics – missing pituitary glands and so forth.


DEAN
Son of a bitch.


BOBBY’S CAR – NIGHT


BOBBY (on phone)
Sam's chasin' a what?


DEAN’S BORROWED VEHICLE – NIGHT


DEAN (on phone)
A Kitsune. It's pretty rare. Dad and I hunted one back in '98.


The scene alternates between BOBBY and DEAN in their respective vehicles.


BOBBY (on phone)
Vaguely rings a bell.


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah, didn't make our highlight reel.


BOBBY (on phone)
Well, least now we know he's working a job.


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah, but why pull the Houdini act?


BOBBY (on phone)
Not a clue.


BOBBY (on phone)
What are you gonna do when you catch up?


DEAN (on phone)
I got a few ideas.


INT. AMY’S HOUSE – NIGHT


AMY puts clothes in a suitcase and lays framed photos, including one of a child, face down. She turns and sees SAM.


AMY
How did you find me?


SAM holds up a receipt.


SAM
You dropped this. "Amy Pond," huh? Cute name. You weren't kidding about the mortgage.


AMY
Sam...


SAM sees blood on AMY’s hand.


SAM
Wait, that's fresh. That's not mine. So, you killed again!


AMY
You think I wanted to?


SAM
I think you better tell me exactly what you're doing, or I have to kill you whether I want to or not!


AMY
I can't. Sam, you know me.


SAM
No, I knew you. But that was a long time ago.


AMY
No, you know me. You know the kind of person I am.


FLASHBACK: INT. YOUNG AMY’S HOUSE – DAY


YOUNG SAM and YOUNG AMY break their kiss. YOUNG SAM tries to set the can of soda on the coffee table, but it falls off and spills.


YOUNG AMY
Oh! Crap.


YOUNG SAM
Sorry. I didn't mean to.


YOUNG AMY
It's just, if she sees it, you know, my mom will be so pissed.


YOUNG SAM
Yeah. It was just an accident.


YOUNG AMY
Yeah, well, she has a temper. Sometimes. It's... no big deal.


YOUNG SAM
My dad does, too. You don't want to see him when he's drinking.


YOUNG AMY
My mom... I don't think she's a good person. Sometimes I don't think I'm a good person, either.


YOUNG SAM
You are.


YOUNG AMY
Don't be so sure.


YOUNG SAM puts his hand over YOUNG AMY’s.


YOUNG SAM
I've been around enough bad to know good when I see it.


YOUNG AMY
It's just she has this... whole plan for me, but... I don't want to be like her, you know?


YOUNG SAM
I don't want to be like my dad, either.


INT. AMY’S HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM
All right. So then tell me what's going on.


AMY
Drop the knife and I'll show you.


SAM
Show me and I'll drop the knife.


AMY
Don't move.


AMY opens the door to a room in which a child is sleeping.


AMY
This is Jacob... my son. I've built a life here, Sam. I'm... in the PTA. I'm boring.


SAM
But you're still feeding.


AMY
On the dead. I'm a mortician. I know. Not sexy, but, you know, health benefits. I quietly take what Jacob and I need. No one gets hurt. But it can be risky, feeding like that, especially for a kid. Jacob got sick. He was dying, and the only way to fight it off was –


SAM
He needed fresh meat.


AMY
It worked. After the last one, his fever broke.


SAM
Amy –


AMY
It's over.


SAM
You can't guarantee that.


AMY
I give you my word. So, how is spilling more blood gonna help anyone? You could still walk away from this. We both can. Sam... After what I did for you.


FLASHBACK: INT. YOUNG AMY’S HOUSE – DAY


YOUNG SAM
Amy, I –


YOUNG AMY
Hide!


YOUNG SAM
What?


YOUNG AMY
Quick!


YOUNG AMY shuts a closet door behind YOUNG SAM. AMY’S MOTHER enters.


YOUNG AMY
Hey.


AMY’S MOTHER
They caught up.


YOUNG AMY
Who caught up?


AMY’S MOTHER
Couple of pros in a piece-of-crap Impala. We're leaving.


YOUNG AMY
But, Mom –


AMY’S MOTHER
I'm only gonna say this once – I put the food on this table, so you will do as you are told or I will let you starve.


AMY’S MOTHER walks towards the closet where YOUNG SAM is hiding.


YOUNG AMY
Okay. Gas up the van. I'll pack.


YOUNG SAM draws his knife in the closet.


AMY’S MOTHER
Good girl.


AMY’S MOTHER leaves.


YOUNG AMY
Awesome first date, huh? Look, I'm sorry you got to go like this, but... What's wrong? Look, I know my mom's –


YOUNG SAM
No, I just have to go. I'm sorry.


YOUNG SAM sees a brain in a jar on a table.


YOUNG AMY
Oh, that – that's nothing! That's just...


YOUNG SAM lifts his knife.


YOUNG AMY
Sam?


YOUNG SAM
It's my dad and brother in the Impala. You're a monster.


YOUNG AMY
You're a hunter. So... You're supposed to kill me? And I'm supposed to kill you?


YOUNG SAM
I guess.


YOUNG AMY
Sam, I've never killed anyone. And I don't want to hurt you. Do you want to hurt me?


YOUNG SAM
No.


YOUNG AMY
Then run. If my mom finds you, she'll kill you. Just run. Please, Sam.


EXT. SAM’S MOTEL – NIGHT


SAM is walking towards his room. He unlocks the door and is punched by DEAN, who was waiting inside. SAM falls backwards into plants.


DEAN
Howdy, Sam.


ACT FOUR
INT. SAM’S MOTEL – NIGHT


DEAN
New rule. You steal my baby, you get punched. The hell were you thinking, Sam, running off like that? I mean, for all I know, Satan could have been callin' your plays.


SAM gets a can of soda from the refrigerator and holds it to his head.


SAM
Dean, look, how many times do I have to tell you? I'm fine.


DEAN
Oh, yeah, no, you're a poster boy for mental health. You have any idea the kind of horror shows I had going on in my head?


SAM
Dean, I left you a note. There was a job in town.


DEAN
A Kitsune. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know. And you ignore Bobby and I's phone calls why, exactly?


SAM
Because I wanted to take care of it. And I did. I took care of it.


DEAN
Really?


SAM
Yes.


DEAN
Where's the body?


SAM
There is no body.


DEAN
Why not?


SAM
Because I let her go. She's gone.


DEAN
You what? Why?


FLASHBACK: INT. YOUNG AMY’S HOUSE – DAY


YOUNG SAM opens the front door to leave YOUNG AMY’s house. AMY’S MOTHER is standing outside. She grabs him and forces him backwards.


YOUNG AMY
Sam!


AMY’S MOTHER
I knew you were hiding something. See, we can never blow town without Amy throwing a bitch-fit. So agreeing to go peacefully – well. Who is this?


YOUNG AMY
He's my friend.


AMY’S MOTHER
No, he's not.


YOUNG AMY
Sam!


AMY’S MOTHER
Shut up! What is wrong with you, huh? You that stupid? Really? I already told you, you cannot have friends. This kid is food!


YOUNG AMY
No!


AMY’S MOTHER lets go of SAM and backhands YOUNG AMY. AMY’S MOTHER raises a fist to SAM.


AMY’S MOTHER
This'll teach you.


AMY’S MOTHER’s fingernails extend into long, pointed claws, then change back to normal. YOUNG AMY has stabbed her from behind.


INT. SAM’S MOTEL – NIGHT


DEAN
You never told me that.


SAM
I never told anyone. I mean, can you imagine what Dad would have done?


DEAN
So you saw the article in the newspaper, and you just bolted.


SAM
It was my mess.


DEAN
And you call letting her go cleaning it up?


SAM
She killed her own mom, Dean, to save me.


DEAN
I hear you, Sam. I do. But look at her now. She's dropping bodies, man... Which means we got to drop her, no matter how many merit badges she racked up when she was a kid. I'm sorry, but it's that simple.


SAM
Nothing in our lives is simple.


FLASHBACK: INT. YOUNG AMY’S HOUSE – DAY


YOUNG SAM
You have to run. Amy! Do you have cash?


YOUNG AMY nods.


YOUNG SAM
I – I want you on the first bus out of town. Tonight.


YOUNG AMY
But what about –


YOUNG SAM
I'll take care of her. Just go!


YOUNG AMY
Come with me. We don't have to be alone. We can be freaks together, Sam. Sam...


YOUNG SAM
I can't. I'm sorry.


YOUNG AMY
So am I.


INT. SAM’S MOTEL – NIGHT


DEAN
Look, man, I get it, okay? You meet a girl, you feel that spark – there's nothing better. But this freak?


SAM grabs his jacket and gets up from a chair at the table.


DEAN
I didn't mean –


SAM
Yeah, you did. Look, I see the way you look at me, Dean, like I'm a grenade and you're waiting for me to go off.


DEAN
Sam –


SAM
I'm not going off. Look, I might be a freak, but that's not the same as dangerous.


DEAN
I didn't say –


SAM
It's okay. Say it. I've spent a lot of my life trying to be normal, but come on. I'm not normal. Look at all the crap I've done, look at me now. I'm a grade-A freak. But I'm managing it. And so is Amy.


DEAN
Is she? How?


SAM
She works at a damn funeral home so she doesn't have to kill anyone, Dean. She's figured out how to deal.


DEAN
Okay, well, then explain the bodies.


SAM
She's done. Her friggin' kid was dying, Dean. Put you or me in her position, we'd probably do the same thing. Look, you don't trust her. Fine. Trust me. Dean, please.


DEAN
Okay.


SAM
Seriously?


DEAN
Got to start sometime, right?


ACT FIVE
EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF A BIGGERSON’S RESTAURANT – DAY


DEAN is on the phone. SAM is walking towards him carrying a shopping bag.


DEAN (on phone)
Bozeman. Right. Got it. Thanks.


DEAN
That was Bobby. We'll hole up in Spokane tonight. We'll meet him tomorrow. Why don't you drive?


DEAN tosses SAM the keys to the IMPALA.


SAM
You gonna punch me again?


INT. IMPALA, OUTSIDE MOTEL – DAY


DEAN
Hey, why don't, uh – why don't you check us in? I got to hit the candy store.


DEAN holds up a bottle of pills.


DEAN
Doctor's orders.


SAM gets out of the car. DEAN slides over to the driver’s seat and drives off.


INT. AMY’S MOTEL – DAY


AMY enters. DEAN is sitting on the couch in her room.


DEAN
Next time you run, you should change your license plates. Keeping the same tags makes you easy to track.


AMY
Who are –


DEAN
I'm Sam's brother. And you are Amy Pond, the Bozeman mortician who went missing. There's people looking for you.


AMY
Sam sent you?


DEAN
Sam doesn't know I'm here.


AMY
But he told you. My son –


DEAN
I know. I know. But people... They are who they are. No matter how hard you try, you are what you are. You will kill again.


AMY
I won't. I swear.


DEAN
Trust me, I'm an expert. Maybe in a year, maybe ten. But eventually, the other shoe will drop. It always does.


DEAN stabs AMY.


DEAN
I'm sorry.


DEAN catches AMY as she falls and lowers her to the bed. He removes his knife, then turns to see AMY’s son JACOB standing at the door.


DEAN
You got someone you can go to?


JACOB nods.


DEAN
You ever kill anyone?


JACOB shakes his head.


DEAN
Well, if you do, I'll come back for you.


JACOB
The only person I'm gonna kill is you.


DEAN
Well, look me up in a few years. Assuming I live that long.


DEAN holds up his hands, one still holding the knife, and walks towards the door. JACOB hurries to his mother’s body. DEAN pauses at the door and watches them.


INT. WHITEFISH MT GAS & SIP STORE – DAY


POSSESSED MAN (on phone)
Yes, sir. Sam Winchester was definitely here. Yes. Every alias we have for them, and I'll find out where they went from here. I'm only a couple days behind them. Just grabbing a bite first.


The CLERK is tied to a chair and gagged.


POSSESSED MAN
Do you know what I find? Plain old people taste fine, but everything is better... with cheese.


The POSSESSED MAN pours a pot of hot cheese over the CLERK. The CLERK screams and the POSSESSED MAN’S mouth transforms: it enlarges, his teeth become long and jagged, and a two-pronged tongue protrudes.
