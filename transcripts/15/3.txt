TEASER
[EXT. HARLAN – QUARANTINE ZONE – DAY]
[The spirits are attacking the ward around Harland. STEVIE enters the scene, cocking her rifle. She glances at the other hunters around her.]
HUNTER Just me, or are these ghost hits coming faster?
STEVIE It's not just you.
[Stevie worriedly watches on as the attack continues.]
[EXT. HARLAN – CEMETERY – DAY]
[DEAN is leading his group to the HIGHLEY MEMORIAL cemetery.]
DEAN Alright, this way.
[SAM is checking his phone.]
DEAN What's the word from outside?
SAM Ghosts are still at it, trying to break down the barrier. I left some Hunters at the gym to keep the peace. The rest are set up around the perimeter, in case —
DEAN In case the spell breaks and a hundred billion ghosts come bursting out. (to Rowena) This better work.
ROWENA It will work. The "Rafforza l'incantesimo" is a potent transubstantiation spell. It can turn gossamer into concrete.
[They walk into the cemetery.]
ROWENA Like I said, get me close to the epicenter, find me a nice, protected ghost-free space – I'll patch those crumbling walls right up, and we'll all be home in time for high tea.
[They walk past the rift in the ground where spirits keep coming out. There are bodies everywhere. They stop.]
CASTIEL (sarcastic) Ah. Great. A nice, protected space.
[A crypt named "CARVER", surrounded by bodies.]
DEAN Ugh.
[They walk in.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[They all get inside and close the doors. Sam locks the doors. Dean and Castiel scatter the salt. Rowena drops her bag and takes her coat off. She opens the Book of the Damned and prepares to perform the spell.]
[Something starts banging on the door from the outside with force. Rowena keeps performing the spell.]
ROWENA (in Italian)
Prendi ciò che è debole, rendilo forte.
D’una piuma d’oca, fai una spada.
D’una piuma d’oca, fai una spada.
D’una piuma d’oca, fai una spada.
[Her eyes glow violet.]
Dalla nebbia, cemento —
[EXT. QUARANTINE ZONE - DAY]
[The ward seems to be reinforcing itself. Stevie sends a text.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
ROWENA Dalla nebbia, cemento possente, impenetrabile, inflessibile.
[Sam gets the text.]
SAM Looks like it's working.
[Rowena stutters.]
[EXT. QUARANTINE ZONE - DAY]
[The ward falters.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
ROWENA Rendilo forte.
Rendilo forte!
[Rowena has visions of the spirits, angry and menacing. She starts panting.]
Rendilo forte.
(yells)
Rendilo forte!
[The bowl clatters to the floor as she falls to the ground.]
DEAN Rowena?
[Rowena sits on the floor, terrified.]
ROWENA We're all going to die.

[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Establishing shot of the crypt.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[Rowena tries to stand up.]
ROWENA Drink.
SAM Of course. Dean.
[Dean passes him water.]
ROWENA A real drink.
[Sam and Dean stare at each other. Then, Dean hands over his flask. Rowena drinks.]
BELPHEGOR
Okay, now that we're waiting for the witch's hooch to kick in, can we finally admit the obvious?
Uh, she failed. So if we're keeping scores, that's, uh, 1 for the demon, uh, 0 for the witch.
ROWENA The enchantment couldn't work. No magic could. The spell put me into a – a communion with the wall.
I – I could feel how weak it is, how close to collapse – and I could feel why. (pause) I could feel them. All of them.
SAM All of them? Them who?
ROWENA
The spirits. Their anger and their hatred, writhing and raging. They're pressed up against those walls breaking them down. There are too many, and they're too wild and desperate and angry.
Together, they are too strong. Those walls will fall, and there's no magic on Earth can stop it.
CASTIEL How long do we have?
ROWENA Hours, if we're lucky.
DEAN Then we get out of here, and we take out as many as we possibly can before those walls fall. Rowena, mix up some of those crystals you got.
ROWENA (laughs)
It wouldn't matter! Those things? It would be like tossing mousetraps at the Great Plague. I'm telling you − it's over!
Perhaps if I'd gotten here sooner, there are any number of spells I could've tried to close the gate to Hell before it got to this point. But now it's too late. The cat's out of the bloody bag.
[Belphegor moves to leave the crypt.]
DEAN Where the hell you going?
[Belphegor doesn't reply.]
DEAN Hey! Wh —
CASTIEL I got him.
DEAN We're not just gonna give up. That's not who we are. Let's go out there and let's take care of —
[Sam gestures Dean to keep quiet. He kneels beside Rowena.]
SAM Rowena. Hey. You okay? You need anything?
[Rowena looks at him.]
ROWENA A moment.
SAM Of course. Sure.
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Castiel and Belphegor are walking through the cemetery.]
CASTIEL So, that's it? You’re just leaving?
BELPHEGOR Oh, like you'd mind if I did. You can't even look at me. Well, sorry to disappoint, but, uh... not leaving. I was looking... for that.
[They walk to the gate to Hell. Spirits are still flying out.]
BELPHEGOR Where it all began.
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[Rowena is sitting on the stairs. Dean is getting ready to fight. Sam sits next to him.]
SAM Hey. What are you doing?
DEAN I'm not gonna give up. That's what I'm doing. Not just gonna sit in this crypt and wait for the walls to come down.
SAM You heard Rowena.
DEAN Yeah, I heard her, okay? Ghosts are gonna bust out, and they're gonna swallow this world. And you want to what, just relax? Take a knee? No. No, we're gonna end this, Sam. Like you said. We're gonna be free.
SAM I know, Dean, I-I just... (exhales) This feels bigger than us. You know? And — And I'm out of ideas, and... And I'm freaked, too.
DEAN Oh, I'm not freaked. I'm angry, okay? I’m pissed.
SAM At God.
DEAN Yes.
SAM Me too.
DEAN I mean, this whole mess, you know? This – This sloppy-ass ghostpocalypse – that's Chuck's ending? No. No, I don't think so. After everything that he has put us through? I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some glorified fanboy get the last word.
[Sam glances at Rowena.]
SAM Right.
[Sam walks to Rowena, who's leafing through the book.]
SAM Hey. Anything useful in there?
ROWENA Not a thing.
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Castiel and Belphegor are still staring at the spirits coming out of Hell.]
BELPHEGOR I don't care what the witch calls it. It's not a door or a gate.
CASTIEL What is it?
BELPHEGOR It's a tear. God stamped his foot, and...
CASTIEL Hell ripped open. Belphegor... why were you looking for this?
[They stare at each other.]
BELPHEGOR That's the longest you've ever looked me in the eyes.
CASTIEL You don't have eyes.
BELPHEGOR True. Okay. I got an idea, but, uh... You're not gonna like it.
[INT. CRYPT - LATER]
[Castiel and Belphegor are back into the crypt.]
SAM Wait, what do you mean, "Lilith's Crook"?
BELPHEGOR Yeah, you know, one of those, uh... curvy-ended canes that shepherds use? Little Bo Peep?
[Nobody seems to have a clue.]
BELPHEGOR It's just a nickname. Doesn't matter. Thing's actually more of a horn. Anyways, when Lilith began sending demons off to Earth to do her bidding, there was a little problem. I mean, yeah, she commended absolute loyalty in Hell, but there was no guarantee that once her minions were topside, that they wouldn't just take advantage of the situation. She needed to control her flock. So —
SAM So she forged the Crook.
DEAN Slash horn.
BELPHEGOR It could – can retrieve all of Hell's lost creatures and bring them (snaps fingers) straight back home.
CASTIEL And why haven't we heard about this before?
BELPHEGOR She never needed to use it. When she ruled, it was enough for us that we knew she could. And then when Crowley took over, he had other forms of discipline... Endless lines, endless paperwork. Not that he liked to spend a lot of time down there, anyway, with us.
DEAN Where is it?
BELPHEGOR Last I heard, it was in Lilith's chamber, which has been sealed for ages.
SAM Now that all the doors in Hell are open —
BELPHEGOR It's just sitting there, ripe for the taking. I get the Crook, sound the Crook, and we suck all Hell's ghosts back into Hell. Then if the witch is feeling up to it...
ROWENA I slam the door shut behind them.
SAM Wait a second. How? With magic from the Book of the Damned?
ROWENA A spell of my own devising. The Sanetur Acre Vulnus. A healing spell of a kind. If this gateway to Hell isn't a gate at all, but a wound, a rupture, I can use the spell to undo the damage Chuck did, and the hole will heal, close itself up. We'll have to time it perfectly. If – If you're in Hell when all this goes down, how will we know when to start?
BELPHEGOR Oh, trust me. You’ll know.
DEAN What are you gonna need?
ROWENA A – A few ingredients, nothing too exotic – lavender, myrrh, the skull of an owl, quiet to perform the spell, and an assistant. Dibs on Samuel.
SAM Er, what? ROWENA You're as close to a seasoned witch as we've got in this lot. And I'll need someone out there by the rupture.
CASTIEL Why?
ROWENA I need to do the spell in the safety of the crypt, but we need someone close to the edge to serve as a fulcrum, a carrier. (pause) Well, to put it in, uh, American action movie terms, they'll be carrying a bomb, I light the fuse, they toss it in – boom. Whoever does this, they'll be unprotected. No salt circles – all manner of angry spirits right up in their grill.
DEAN Sounds like fun.
[Belphegor raises his hand.]
ROWENA Yes, Belphegor?
BELPHEGOR Uh, who's coming with me? I'm sorry, but I'm not going down to Hell and getting past all those pissed off ghosts and demons that are maybe loitering down there, and sounding the Crook all by myself.
SAM So you want company?
BELPHEGOR I want protection. (He looks at Cas) Muscle.
DEAN Yeah, Cas'll go.
[Castiel looks stunned and hurt.]
DEAN You've been to Hell before.
CASTIEL Well, it sounds like I don't have a choice.
DEAN Good. Great. Go team.
[INT. HOSPITAL - DAY]
[KETCH is in his hospital bed, asleep. He wakes up.]
NURSE Mr. Blackmore? You're awake.
KETCH Mr. Bl − Ah, yes, yes.
NURSE They took the bullets out. Folks who dropped you off claimed you were injured in a... hunting accident?
KETCH Yes. One − One − One could call it that. Right.
[He starts getting out of bed.]
NURSE Where do you think you're going?
KETCH Off and away.
NURSE Well, you can't. You're in observation. A-A resident needs to clear you.
KETCH Yes, well, I'm sorry, my dear − there's no time. I have, um, friends who need my help.
NURSE Uh, sir —
[She turns and almost bumps into demon ARDAT, possessing a doctor.]
NURSE Thank God, doctor Clarke, I —
[Ardat snaps her neck.]
ARDAT Hello, Arthur.
KETCH Ardat.
[They fight. Ketch finds his angel blade, and holds it behind his back.]
ARDAT You had one job. Find Belphegor.
[Ketch tries to attack Ardat with the angel blade, but she stops him and pins him against the wall.]
ARDAT And I think you know where he is.
[Ketch chuckles.]
KETCH I assure you, I haven't the foggiest.
ARDAT Such valor, and for what? One profoundly irritating demon? No. I think you're protecting the others. Humans. Your friends.
[Ketch nods.]
ARDAT And you won't give them up? (she chokes him) Not for any price?
KETCH Not at any price.
[Ardat stares at him. Then, she kills him by pulling his heart out of his chest.]

ACT TWO
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Belphegor and Castiel are walking back to the rupture.]
BELPHEGOR You got a plan for after? Getting topside? Witch's spell goes right, the abyss will be sealing up quick.
CASTIEL I'll figure something out.
BELPHEGOR You know, your part in all this is, uh, pretty dangerous. I mean, you could die, get trapped in Hell. Your friends might never see you again. Funny, 'cause, uh, they didn't seem to think twice about it.
[Castiel takes that in.]
BELPHEGOR Come on. It's more fun when you fight back.
CASTIEL How do we get down there?
BELPHEGOR Eh, I don't know. I didn't see any stairs or anything, so I just figure that we —
[Castiel pushes Belphegor into the rift. Then, he jumps, too.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[Stevie is back to the crypt with the ingredients for Rowena's spell.]
STEVIE Salt, a couple guns from the back of the Impala. And for the ginger... witch stuff.
[Rowena checks the bag.]
ROWENA Forget something?
STEVIE Right. One owl skull.
[She hands it to Rowena.]
DEAN RIP, Hedwig.
STEVIE You're welcome.
SAM Alright, so, how bad is it out there?
STEVIE People are pretty restless, but we're keeping a lid on. Getting here through the quarantine zones, I stuck to the corners, only got attacked a few times. I think most of the ghosts are at the edge of town working to bring down those walls.
So what are you planning in here? Another long-shot, magical Hail Mary?
DEAN Yeah. Yeah, except this time, hopefully, it works.
[Dean looks at Rowena.]
SAM So we need you and the other Hunters armed up and ready on the other side of that wall. Cause if this goes sideways, you'll be the only thing standing between those ghosts and the world.
STEVIE No pressure, right?
[Dean's cellphone buzzes.]
DEAN Ketch. Says he's ready to get back in the game.
[INT. HOSPITAL - DAY]
[Ketch lies on the floor, dead. Ardat is texting Dean. We see Dean reply to the text, informing her that they are at the crypt and explaining the plan.]
[INT. HELL - DAY]
[Belphegor and Castiel are walking down the stairs to Hell.]
CASTIEL It's awfully quiet down here.
BELPHEGOR Yeah. Too quiet.
[Castiel looks at him.]
BELPHEGOR Sorry, I thought we were doing a bit. Guess everyone took their shot and got out. Told you, I'm an oddball... I actually like it here.
CASTIEL You knew Hell was nearly empty. Yet you needed protection, "muscle", for this?
BELPHEGOR Okay, you got me. I wanted company. I wanted your company. What? Shouldn't we at least try and be friends? Sam and Dean, they seem to be coming around. I think I'm, uh, growing on them. You know, like a cancer.
CASTIEL You are not growing on anyone. Sam and Dean are just using you. Don't mistake that for caring about you, because I can assure you they don't.
BELPHEGOR Wow. You learn that the hard way? What is it, Cas, really? This, uh, seething animosity.
[Castiel takes a moment.]
CASTIEL You're wearing Jack, who was like a son to me, like a coat. Every second in your presence is intolerable. It's an abomination. You're an abomination. Is this it?
BELPHEGOR Yep.
[They are in front of the door to Lilith's chamber. There is cluttering coming from the other side. Belphegor pushes a disgruntled Castiel forward. Angel blade in hand, Castiel opens the door.]
[INT. LILITH’S CHAMBER - DAY]
[Belphegor and Castiel walk in. They carefully have a look around. There is a DEMON looting the chamber.]
BELPHEGOR Malfayan?
MALFAYAN Bel? Hey!
BELPHEGOR Uh, what are you doing?
MALFAYAN What? Not like Lilith's coming back.
[Castiel launches himself at Malfayan and puts the angel blade at his throat.]
MALFAYAN Whoa, easy, man! Easy! (to Belphegor) What, are you working with angels now?
BELPHEGOR Yeah, he's a little on edge.
CASTIEL Does he have the horn?
BELPHEGOR No. But, uh... Ooh − Dude. Is that the Haxon Ring?
MALFAYAN Yeah. It's pretty sweet, eh? I mean, it's a bit...
[Castiel kills Malfayan.]
BELPHEGOR Really?
CASTIEL We came for one thing, and one thing only.
BELPHEGOR Right.
CASTIEL I don't think your friend was the first demon to loot the place.
BELPHEGOR Eh, guess not. Good thing what we're after... (he taps his finger on a box) is right here. I don't see a latch. What do you think of these markings?
[Castiel gets closer.]
CASTIEL It's Enochian. "Oh-ah-kuh-ree-me ah-tay-loh-kuh-vah-veem noh-ruh." It's a song of praise. To Lucifer. They're verses. It's, uh... It's an incantation to open the box.
BELPHEGOR Smart. Lilith knew she was the only one down here who could read it. Good thing I brought you!
CASTIEL Fine.
[Castiel kneels to read the verses.]
CASTIEL Oh-rah-moh-tay-da-ah-boh-da tay-da-ba. Va-veem-noh-ruh lahp tee-ah toh-ruht-sool ohl-ah-oh. Toh-luh-ah ay-kuh-ree-me juh-uhz-hay oh-ruh-suh ee-yahd. Ah ee-yahd day toh-luh-hah-mee.
[Nothing happens.]
CASTIEL It's not working.
BELPHEGOR Yeah. You know, uh, they're verses, Cas. I think they need to be sung.
[Castiel sighs.]
CASTIEL (singing)
Toh-luh dah...
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Dean is standing on the edge of the rift. He gets ready.]
DEAN Where you at, Ketch?
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[Sam is worriedly looking at the door.]
ROWENA Eyes on the page. I need you off book for this incantation.
SAM Yeah, sorry. I just feel like I should be out there fighting.
ROWENA And magic isn't fighting? Dean's doing his part. It's time for you to do yours. The plan.
[Sam is hesitating.]
SAM Of course, right. Our one shot.
ROWENA Read.
[Sam opens the book.]
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Dean gets Rowena's bomb out of his bag.]
DEAN Come on, come on, let's go
[INT. LILITH’S CHAMBER - DAY]
CASTIEL (singing) ... mee.
[The box opens.]
BELPHEGOR Oh, Cas, your voice... it's like, uh... like an angel.
[Castiel takes the horn.]
CASTIEL Shut up.
BELPHEGOR Guess it's go time. You're gonna need a head start getting out of here.
[Castiel is about to hand the horn to Belphegor, when Ardat attacks him and knocks him out. She stares at Belphegor.]

ACT THREE
[INT. LILITH'S CRYPT]
BELPHEGOR Oh. Hey. Ardat. How'd you find me?
ARDAT I got a hot tip. A very hot, very British tip. I knew the second those doors flew open that you'd be looking for a way to take power.
[Ardat kicks Belphegor to the ground. She punches him. Castiel starts to wake up.]
ARDAT Lilith's Crook? A solid play. But you on the throne? Never. Going. To. Happen.
[Castiel attacks Ardat. They fight.]
CASTIEL The horn!
ARDAT You know he wants to rule Hell. It's all he's ever wanted.
[They keep fighting.]
ARDAT I've been watching him for centuries, bowing and scraping to Lilith and Crowley, all of them. Just waiting for his chance at the throne. And now you're gonna give it to him? Do you have any idea what he is?
[Belphegor stabs her in the back with the angel blade.]
BELPHEGOR Wow. Blah, blah, blah... she always was a talker.
CASTIEL Is it true?
BELPHEGOR You should go, Cas.
CASTIEL Is it true?
BELPHEGOR No! (Chuckles) Okay, look, I don't want to rule Hell.
CASTIEL Then what do you want?
[They look at each other.]
BELPHEGOR You should go.
[Belphegor throws Castiel away.]
BELPHEGOR What do I want? I got what I want. This thing, it isn't just a leash... it's a siphon.
CASTIEL What does that mean?
BELPHEGOR It means that all the ghosts and all the demons – I'm gonna suck them all right back into me. The power of a kajillion souls. Lilith, Crowley... they are nothing. I'll be a God. Or, you know, close enough. Great timing, right? 'Cause, uh, heard there was a vacancy.
CASTIEL So the chest, the Enochian – you've been playing us all along.
BELPHEGOR I couldn't have done it without you.
[Belphegor plays the horn.]
INT. CRYPT - DAY
[Everything starts clattering. Sam and Rowena raise their heads.]
ROWENA It's time, Sam.
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Dean watches the spirits flock to Hell.]
[INT. HELL - DAY]
[Souls flock to Lilith's horn. Castiel isn't able to move.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[Sam and Rowena start performing the spell.
SAM AND ROWENA Mundus fractus est. Sanetur acre vulnus. Adveniant harena atque saxum, sursum, et deorsum.
[INT. HELL - DAY]
[Belphegor keeps playing the horn. Souls keep flying to him.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[Sam is distracted by the clattering.]
ROWENA Sam.
[They nod at each other.]
SAM AND ROWENA Claudatur porta inter orbes terrarum...
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Dean is waiting for the right moment.]
[INT. HELL - DAY]
[Souls keep flocking to the horn.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
SAM AND ROWENA Nobis et illis.
[The spell is starting to work.]
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Rowena's bomb starts glowing in Dean's hands.]
[INT. HELL - DAY]
[Castiel struggles to get closer to Belphegor.]
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Dean throws the bomb into the rift. The walls start tumbling down.]
[INT. HELL - DAY]
[Castiel manages to tackle Belphegor. He punches him.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[The rumbling stops.]
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Dean realizes something may have gone wrong.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
SAM Rowena, what happened?
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
DEAN What the hell?
[INT. HELL - DAY]
[Castiel keeps punching Belphegor.]
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
SAM
Did it work? Rowena?
[INT. HELL - DAY]
[Castiel punches Belphegor again and again.]
BELPHEGOR Cas! Stop. Please. It's me... Jack.
CASTIEL Liar.
[Castiel smites him, until there the vessel is charred. He sobs.]

ACT FOUR
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Dean makes a call.]
DEAN Sam?
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
[Sam picks up the phone.]
SAM Hey. What's going on? Are the ghosts gone?
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
DEAN Hell if I know. But the crack's starting to close up.
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
DEAN (V.O.) Something doesn't feel right.
SAM Fine, just... don't...
[Rowena is sitting on the floor. She sticks her dagger into her own shoulder.]
SAM
Rowena? What are you doing?
[Rowena goes through her wound and takes out a sachet.]
ROWENA My last resurrection sachet. Won't need that where I'm going.
SAM Where y— Where you're "going"? What are you talking about?
ROWENA Lilith's Crook, Belphegor sucking the souls into Hell – that was your only shot. It wasn't mine. Magic can do anything, Samuel, can contain anything... even the vast multitudes of Hell.
SAM Contain? What do you mean, "contain"?
ROWENA I can soak them up for a time if I pay the price. "Death Is an Infinite Vessel." A spell so simple it draws its power from its caster. Just two ingredients.
SAM And you have them here?
ROWENA Aye.
SAM Rowena, why didn't you tell us?
ROWENA Because, dear, the first ingredient is my own still-coursing blood. And the last is my final breath.
SAM What?
ROWENA I'll absorb the ghosts and demons and return them to Hell. In time, my body'll break down, and they'll be released right where they belong.
SAM No, no. No. Rowena... no.
ROWENA Yes, Samuel. To perform this spell, I have to die. And it has to be you that kills me.
[Rowena hands him the dagger.]
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Dean is watching the walls rumble down.]
CASTIEL Dean.
DEAN Cas! What the hell happened?
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
SAM No.
ROWENA It has to be you. My real, permanent demise is at your hands. It's in Death's books.
SAM Yeah, well, you know what? Screw the books.
[Sam refuses to take the dagger.]
ROWENA I can't do this myself, Sam. I can't. It has to be you that kills me.
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
DEAN Where's Belphegor?
CASTIEL I killed him.
DEAN You did what? Wh-What about the Crook?
CASTIEL It's gone. It was destroyed.
DEAN What?!
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
ROWENA Hell's closing. The walls are falling.
SAM There has to be another way.
ROWENA I wish there were... I do. I don't care about anything enough to take my own life. Not you, your brother... not even the world. But I believe in prophecy. I believe in magic. And I'm here, and you're here, and everything we need to end this right is in our hands.
[She puts the dagger in Sam's hands and tries to get him to stab her.]
ROWENA I know this in my bones... it has to be this way. Do it! Kill me, Samuel!
[Sam hesitates. Rowena puts a hand on his shoulder.]
ROWENA I know we've gotten quite fond of each other, haven't we? But will you let the world die, let your brother die, just so I can live?
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
DEAN Cas, this was our only shot. What the hell were you thinking?
[INT. CRYPT - DAY]
SAM No.
[He stabs her, crying. Rowena touches his face.]
ROWENA That's my boy.
[She twists the dagger where Sam stabbed her. Then, she takes it out.]
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
CASTIEL Dean...
[Spirits start flocking to Rowena's wound.]
CASTIEL Rowena?
[EXT. HARLAN – QUARANTINE ZONE – DAY]
[All the spirits are leaving the ward.]
[EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]
[Rowena walks to the rift, spirits still flocking to her. When she absorbed them all, she stands on the edge of the rupture and glances at the boys.]
ROWENA Goodbye, boys.
[Then, she lets herself fall into the rift, which slowly fills up.]

ACT FIVE
[INT. BUNKER - SAM'S ROOM - DAY]
[Sam is sitting on his bed, thinking. Someone knocks on the door.]
SAM Yeah.
[Dean walks into the room.]
DEAN How you holding up?
SAM Any word from Stevie?
DEAN Yeah, I just talked to her. She says the town's good. Well, good as can be expected.
SAM Right. Good.
DEAN
They found Ketch. Dead.
SAM He... What? How?
DEAN Bad. Probably a demon.
[Sam sighs.]
DEAN We did it, though, man. It's over. God threw one last apocalypse at us, and we beat it.
SAM Yeah.
DEAN What you did... Rowena... You didn't have a choice.
SAM I know.
[INT. LIBRARY - BUNKER - DAY]
[Dean is pouring himself a drink.]
CASTIEL
How's Sam?
DEAN
Not great.
CASTIEL Sorry about Rowena.
DEAN You're sorry? Why didn't you just stick to the damn plan?
CASTIEL Belphegor was lying.
DEAN Belphegor's a demon.
CASTIEL He was using us. He wanted to eat every last soul to take over Hell, Earth, and every...
DEAN Yeah, and we would've figured it out... after. With Rowena.
CASTIEL The plan changed, Dean. Something went wrong. You know this. Something always goes wrong.
DEAN Yeah, why does that something always seem to be you?
[Castiel stares at him, stunned and hurt.]
CASTIEL You used to trust me, give me the benefit of the doubt. Now you can barely look at me. My powers are failing, and – and I've tried to talk to you, over and over, and you just don't want to hear it. You don't care. I'm... dead to you. You still blame me for Mary.
[Dean nods.]
CASTIEL Well, I don't think there's anything left to say.
[Castiel makes to leave.]
DEAN Where you going?
CASTIEL Jack's dead. Chuck's gone. You and Sam have each other. I think it's time for me to move on.
[Castiel leaves.]
