NOW
INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Alliance, Nebraska

A YOUNG WOMAN, whose name is AMBER, watches a movie on television. A hairbrush sits on top of the TV. AMBER leans forward and takes the brush, brushing her hair while she watches. AMBER hears something and turns around. She puts the brush back and gets up to look around.

AMBER
Jimmy?

AMBER walks a little further and slides a closet open—she is wearing plastic nails—to reveal a BOY, JIMMY, unmoving and covered in something red that looks like blood. AMBER sighs.

AMBER I told you to go to bed.

JIMMY answers with minimal movement.

JIMMY
I can't. I'm dead.

AMBER leans down to touch the red stuff.

AMBER
What is this—ketchup? Gross!

JIMMY gets up.

JIMMY
Ow! You're mean.

AMBER
Yeah, that's what your parents pay me for—to be mean.

AMBER puts a hand on JIMMY's shoulder, pushing him along. He's wearing a headband with arrow halves on either side.

AMBER
Bed—now!

JIMMY
Okay, okay. Just wait.

AMBER lets go. JIMMY turns around and takes off the headband.

JIMMY
Wait. I'll go to bed if you let me touch your boob.

AMBER sighs, shoving JIMMY along.

AMBER
Oh! Go!

AMBER watches JIMMY climb the stairs, then goes back to the movie. She hears barking and turns off the TV; the barking continues. AMBER goes to the window and moves the curtains to look out.

EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT

INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

There's nothing but static on the TV. A MAN and WOMAN, JIMMY's parents, walk past the window and into the house. AMBER is lying on her side on the sofa, apparently asleep.

JIMMY'S FATHER
I'll, uh, take Amber home. Don't wait up.

The MOTHER, whose name is FRANCINE, goes upstairs. The FATHER shuts off the TV and goes to the back of the sofa.

JIMMY'S FATHER
Amber.

No response.

JIMMY'S FATHER
Amber.

No response.

JIMMY'S FATHER
Amber?

The FATHER leans down to touch AMBER and feels something squelch. He turns on the light and looks at the liquid on his fingers: blood. The FATHER rolls AMBER onto her back. There is a hole in her skull that shows her brain.

JIMMY'S FATHER
Francine!

ACT ONE
MORGUE
INT. MORGUE – DAY

DEAN and SAM, wearing suits, hold up FBI badges.

DEAN
Agents Page and Plant, FBI.

I BELIEVE THE CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE

DOCTOR
Gentlemen. What brings you by?

SAM
We need to see Amber Freer's body.

DOCTOR
Really? What for?

Starring
JARED PADALECKI

DEAN
The police report said something clawed through her skull?

DOCTOR
You didn't read the autopsy report that I emailed out this morning?

JENSEN ACKLES

SAM
W-we had, uh, server issues.

MISHA COLLINS

The DOCTOR walks away. DEAN and SAM follow. The DOCTOR opens one of the freezers and pulls out the slab with AMBER's body. He tosses back the sheet from her head.

DOCTOR
When they brought her in, we thought she was attacked by a wolf or something.

DEAN
Or something.

DOCTOR
But we were wrong.

The DOCTOR picks up a plastic bag from the slab and shows it to DEAN and SAM.

SAM
Is that a—

DOCTOR
It's a press-on nail. We found it in her temporal lobe.

SAM
Is that even possible?

DEAN
Wait, are you—you saying that she did this to herself?

DOCTOR
Uh-huh. She scratched her brains out. It'd take hours, and it'd hurt like hell, but sure—it's possible.

DEAN
How?

DOCTOR
Pick your acronym—OCD, PCP. It all spells crazy.

SAM pulls back the sheet a little further. AMBER's right hand has four press-on nails still attached; the middle finger has nothing.

DOCTOR
My guess, some kind of phantom itch. I mean, an extreme case, but...

SAM
Phantom itch?

DOCTOR
Yup.

The DOCTOR covers AMBER's head and slides the slab back into the freezer, closing the door.

Guest Starring
GATTLIN GRIFFITH

DOCTOR
All it takes is someone talking about an itch—or thinking about one, even—and suddenly you can't stop scratching.

SAM
Thanks, doc.

EVER CARRADINE

SAM scratches under his collar and DEAN scratches his ear.

JIMMY'S HOUSE
INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

SAM is sitting in the armchair in JIMMY's family's living room, holding a notebook and pen, and JIMMY'S FATHER and FRANCINE are sitting on the sofa. DEAN is wandering around behind them.

SAM
Okay. Okay, now, some of these questions might seem a bit odd, but please just bear with me.

DEAN chuckles.

DEAN

No, sir.

DEAN
You sure about that?

JIMMY
I—I would tell you if I knew something.

DEAN looks at him.

JIMMY
I promise. One hundred percent. Cross my heart.

Produced by

DEAN looks back over his shoulder, then back at JIMMY.

DEAN
Well, Jimmy, I, uh...I happen to know you're lying.

JIMMY
I'm not.

DEAN leans down and puts a hand on JIMMY's shoulder.

DEAN
We gonna start talking truth, or are you and me gonna have to take a little trip downtown?

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and SAM are leaving. DEAN holds up a packet of itching powder.

DEAN
Kid said he put this on the babysitter's hairbrush.

SAM
Dean, there's no way—

Created by

SAM
—itching powder made that girl scratch her brains out. It's just ground-up maple seeds.

DEAN
If you have any other theories, I'm open to 'em.

A cell phone rings. SAM pulls his out and answers it. DEAN opens the Impala's driver's door.

SAM
Yeah? ...Yeah, we'll be right there.

SAM goes around behind the car. DEAN gets in the car and closes the door.

HOSPITAL
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY

A NURSE zips up a body bag and he and another NURSE roll it out of the room while the DOCTOR watches from the corridor. SAM and DEAN come up behind him.

SAM
What happened?

DOCTOR
Guy got electrocuted.

DEAN
Any idea how?

DOCTOR
Eh, maybe a loose wire or a piece of equipment shorted out. So far, we haven't found anything.

SAM
Witnesses?

DOCTOR
Yeah, guy in there—Mr. Stanley.

STANLEY is an old man sitting in a chair in the room, looking out the window.

DOCTOR
He says he saw it, but he's not making a lick of sense. Senile.

SAM
Thanks.

SAM and DEAN enter the room. The DOCTOR leaves.

SAM
Um, Mr. Stanley?

STANLEY
It was just a joke. I didn't know it would really work.

DEAN
What would work?

STANLEY looks at DEAN.

STANLEY
All I did was shake his hand.

STANLEY holds out his hand: he's holding a joy buzzer. SAM and DEAN look at it and each other.

MOTEL
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

DEAN puts on a pair of goggles and a pair of gloves. He adjusts the goggles and picks up the joy buzzer. He looks at the joy buzzer for a moment, then turns to SAM.

DEAN
You ready?

SAM
Hit it, Mr. Wizard.

SAM holds another pair of goggles to his eyes.

There is a large uncooked ham in two stacked aluminum-foil pans sitting on the table in front of DEAN. DEAN holds the joy buzzer over the ham, hesitates, and presses it to the ham. Electricity crackles. Steam rises from the ham as it changes color. When the ham is blackened, DEAN removes the joy buzzer. The ham sizzles. SAM lowers the goggles and gawks. DEAN flips up the dark-plastic visor on the goggles.

DEAN
That'll do, pig.

SAM
What the hell?

DEAN takes off the goggles, still staring at the now-cooked ham.

SAM
That crap isn't supposed to work.

DEAN
This thing doesn't even have batteries.

DEAN has taken off one glove and now removes the other.

SAM
So...so, what? Are—are we looking at cursed objects?

DEAN
Sounds good.

DEAN pulls out a knife, flips it open, and cuts a piece off the ham.

DEAN
Maybe there's a powerful witch in town.

DEAN eats the piece of ham.

DEAN
Is there any link between the, uh, the joy buzzer and the itching powder?

SAM
Uh, one was made in China, the other Mexico, but they were both bought from the same store.

DEAN cuts off another piece of ham.

DEAN
Hmm.

DEAN holds up the piece of ham. SAM shakes his head. DEAN eats the ham.

CONJURARIUM
INT. CONJURARIUM – DAY

Seen through the glass on the store door, DEAN and SAM walk up. The door chimes when they walk in. Someone laughs and the door chimes again. DEAN and SAM walk around.

DEAN
Sam!

DEAN picks up a whoopee cushion and holds it up, grinning. SAM sighs and shakes his head, turning away. DEAN brings the whoopee cushion up to the checkout counter, which has a display of rubber chickens next to it. The OWNER comes out of the back room.

OWNER
Welcome to the Conjurarium, sanctum of magic and mystery.

SAM comes up to the counter.

SAM
You the owner?

OWNER
Yep.

DEAN
You sold any itching powder or joy buzzers lately?

OWNER
Yeah, a grand total of one of each. They aren't exactly big-ticket items. Look, you boys here to buy something or what?

DEAN pulls some cash out of his wallet, holds up the whoopee cushion, and hands the OWNER the cash.

SAM
So, you get many customers?

OWNER
Kids come in. They don't buy much, but they're more than happy to break stuff. These days, all they care about are their iPhones and those kissing-vampire movies. The whole thing makes me just—

DEAN
Angry?

The OWNER pauses, then nods.

OWNER
Yeah. Yeah, I am angry. This shop has been my life for twenty years, and now it's wasting away to nothing.

DEAN
Which is why you hate them.

OWNER
I suppose.

DEAN
You wish there was something you could do about it.

OWNER
Yeah, I guess I do.

DEAN
So you're taking revenge.

DEAN pulls a rubber chicken off the display and slaps it down on the counter.

DEAN
With this.

DEAN holds up the joy buzzer and presses it to the rubber chicken. Electricity crackles. The OWNER yelps and leaps back.

OWNER
Oh! No!

The rubber chicken melts. The OWNER stares, making inarticulate noises. DEAN and SAM watch the OWNER.

SAM
Yeah, something tells me this guy is not a powerful witch.

DEAN
Sorry. Sorry.

DEAN and SAM leave.

ANOTHER HOUSE
EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT

INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

A GIRL'S FATHER holds up a baby tooth to show the GIRL, who is sitting in bed.

GIRL'S FATHER
I'll just slip this tooth under your pillow, and while you're asleep, the tooth fairy will float down and swap it out for a quarter.

GIRL
So some freak is gonna come in my room while I'm sleeping and take my tooth? Sounds scary. No, thank you.

GIRL'S FATHER
Come on.

The FATHER stands up and fusses with the GIRL's pillows. The GIRL lies back and the FATHER tucks her in, then gives her a kiss.

GIRL'S FATHER
Good night, sweetie.

The FATHER turns off the light as he leaves. The GIRL shifts position.

INT. FATHER'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

The GIRL sneaks into her FATHER's room, tooth in hand, hides it under his pillow, and sneaks out. He doesn't notice. He rolls over. A long pause.

A hand covers the FATHER's mouth. He startles awake. A MAN is standing there, wearing a pink tutu and sparkly wings: it's the TOOTH FAIRY.

TOOTH FAIRY
Shh! Hold still. You might feel just a little...pinch.

The TOOTH FAIRY reaches into the FATHER's mouth with a pair of pliers. The FATHER tries to scream. The TOOTH FAIRY pulls out a tooth.

ACT TWO
HOSPITAL
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

The GIRL'S FATHER is lying in a hospital bed. A NURSE offers him a glass with a straw. He waves it away. SAM is in the room with a notebook and pen; he leaves. DEAN is in the corridor, talking to another NURSE, whose name is JEN FREMONT.

DEAN
Well, I, uh, appreciate that, Nurse...

DEAN reads her name tag.

DEAN
Fremont.

FREMONT
Please—call me Jen.

DEAN
Oh. Jen it is.

FREMONT smiles at DEAN and leaves. SAM clears his throat. DEAN turns to him, clapping once.

DEAN
What's up with Toothless? Cavity creeps get ahold of him?

SAM
Yeah. Close. He wrote up a description.

SAM reads from his notebook.

SAM
Five foot ten, three hundred fifty pounds, wings, and a pink tutu. Said it was the tooth fairy.

DEAN
So he's obviously whacked out on painkillers.

SAM
Maybe. Whatever it was got past locked doors and windows without triggering the alarm.

DEAN
Come on. Tooth fairy?

SAM
And it left thirty-two quarters underneath his pillow. One for each tooth.

DEAN nods.

DEAN
Well, I will see your crazy and raise you some. There's a couple of kids upstairs with stomach ulcers—say they got it from mixing Pop Rocks and Coke. Another guy...his face...froze that way.

SAM
What way?

DEAN looks in all directions, then pulls out the sides of his mouth and crosses his eyes. He holds it for a moment and lets go.

DEAN
He, uh, held it too long, and it—it stuck. They're flying in a plastic surgeon.

DEAN pokes at his cheeks and wiggles his chin.

SAM
So, I mean, if you add all that up...

SAM hesitates. DEAN raises his eyebrows.

SAM
I got nothing.

SAM starts down the hallway past DEAN, who turns around to walk alongside him.

DEAN
I thought sea-monkeys were real.

SAM
They are. They're brine shrimp.

DEAN
No, no, no, I mean like in the ads. You know, like the sea-monkey wife cooks the pot roast for the sea-monkey husband, and the sea-monkey kids play with the dog in a sea-monkey castle—real. I mean, I was six, but I believed it.

SAM
Okay.

DEAN
Point is...

DEAN stops. SAM stops and turns.

DEAN
Maybe that's the connection. The tooth fairy, the Pop Rocks and Coke, the joy buzzer that shocks you—they're all lies that kids believe.

SAM
And now they're coming true. Okay, so whatever's doing this is—is reshaping reality. It has the powers of a god. Or—

SAM rolls his eyes.

SAM
—of a trickster.

DEAN
Yeah, with the sense of humor of a nine-year-old.

SAM
Or you.

SAM walks off. DEAN follows.

MOTEL
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

DEAN sits at the table and takes another bite from a sandwich. The remnants of the cooked ham sit on the table. The door opens and SAM comes in, holding a map. DEAN looks up.

SAM
Dude, seriously—still with the ham?

DEAN talks through the mouthful.

DEAN
We don't have a fridge.

SAM closes the door and puts the map down in front of DEAN.

SAM
Well, I found something.

DEAN stands up for a better view. SAM points to a red X on the map for every incident.

SAM
Um, tooth fairy attack was here, Pop Rocks and Coke was here, then you've got itching powder, face freeze, and joy buzzer—all located within a two-mile radius.

SAM indicates the area containing all the red X's.

DEAN
So, we got a blast zone of weird, and inside, fantasy becomes reality.

SAM
Looks like.

DEAN
And what's the A-bomb at its center?

SAM
Four acres of farmland...and a house.

DEAN
Our motel isn't in that circle, by any chance?

SAM
Yeah. Why?

DEAN hesitates, then holds up his right hand: the palm is covered in hair. SAM looks away, closing his eyes.

SAM
Ugh, dude—

SAM sighs.

SAM
That's not what I think it is, is it?

DEAN
I got bored. That nurse was hot.

DEAN grins.

SAM
You know you can go blind from that, too.

DEAN
Give me five minutes. We'll go check out that house.

DEAN walks around SAM.

SAM
Hey, do not use my razor!

DEAN smirks.

JESSE'S HOUSE
EXT. FARMHOUSE – DAY

A mail truck drives past the house and past the Impala, which pulls up and parks. DEAN and SAM, wearing suits, get out and cross the street, walking up to the house. DEAN checks Ruby's knife, which is tucked into his belt. SAM bends down to pick the lock, but straightens up in a hurry when the door opens. A BOY is there; his name is JESSE.

JESSE
Can I help you?

SAM
Hi. Uh, what's your name?

JESSE
Who wants to know?

SAM and DEAN glance at each other.

DEAN
The, uh...

DEAN clears his throat and pulls out his badge, showing it to JESSE while SAM goes for his badge.

DEAN
FBI.

SAM holds up his badge. JESSE takes DEAN's.

JESSE
Let me see that.

JESSE examines DEAN's badge and hands it back. SAM puts his away.

JESSE
So, what, you guys don't knock?

DEAN
Are your parents home?

JESSE
They work.

SAM
Well, you mind if we ask you a few questions, maybe take a look around the house?

JESSE
I don't know.

DEAN
Come on. You can trust us. We're the authorities.

DEAN holds up his badge again. JESSE is unimpressed. He glances between the two of them. DEAN and SAM try to smile reassuringly.

INT. KITCHEN – DAY

A pot of soup is boiling on the stove. JESSE goes up to it and turns it off. SAM and DEAN follow him into the kitchen, looking around. DEAN hangs back.

SAM
What's that?

JESSE
It's called soup.

JESSE takes the pot off the stove.

JESSE
You heat it up and you eat it.

SAM chuckles.

SAM
Right. I, I know. It's just, um...I used to make my own dinner, too, when I was a kid.

JESSE
Well, I'm not a kid.

DEAN notices the artwork on the fridge.

SAM
Right. No, I, I know. Um...

SAM holds out a hand.

SAM
I'm Robert, by the way.

JESSE shakes SAM's hand.

JESSE
Jesse.

SAM
Jesse, nice to meet you.

DEAN steps closer, holding a picture of a bearded man with pink wings and tutu.

DEAN
Did you draw this?

JESSE nods.

JESSE
It's the tooth fairy.

DEAN
That's what you think the tooth fairy looks like, huh?

JESSE
Yeah. My dad told me about him.

DEAN glances at SAM.

DEAN
Huh.

JESSE
What, didn't your dad tell you about the tooth fairy?

DEAN
My dad?

DEAN chuckles.

DEAN
My dad told me different stories.

JESSE
Well, the tooth fairy isn't a story.

JESSE
What do you know about itching powder, Jesse?

JESSE
That stuff will make you scratch your brains out.

DEAN
Pop Rocks and Coke?

JESSE
You mix them, and you'll end up in the hospital. Everyone knows that.

DEAN pulls the joy buzzer out of his pocket and holds it up.

JESSE
You shouldn't have that.

DEAN
Why not?

JESSE
It can electrocute you.

DEAN
Actually, it can't. It's just a wind-up toy. It's totally harmless. Doesn't even have batteries.

JESSE
So it can't shock you?

DEAN
Nope. Not at all. I swear.

JESSE
Oh. Okay.

DEAN
I mean, all it does is just shake in your hand. It's kind of lame. See?

DEAN presses the joy buzzer to SAM's chest. It buzzes. SAM stiffens up and turns to DEAN, looking murderous.

DEAN
What did you say your name was, again?

ACT THREE
JESSE'S HOUSE
EXT. FARMHOUSE – DAY

SAM and DEAN leave JESSE's house.

SAM
Dude, what the hell?

DEAN
I had a hunch. I went with it.

SAM
You risked my ass on a hunch?

DEAN
You're fine.

SAM
Besides, now we know who's turning this town into Willy Wonka's worst nightmare.

SAM
The kid.

SAM stops walking; so does DEAN.

DEAN
Yeah. Everything Jesse believes comes true. He thinks the tooth fairy looks like Belushi, uh, joy buzzers really shock people, boom, that's what happens.

SAM
Yeah, but convince him the joy buzzers don't actually work, and they go from killing machines back into crap toys.

DEAN
He probably doesn't even know he's doing it.

DEAN and SAM look back at the house. The curtains on an upstairs window part and JESSE looks out at them. DEAN waves.

DEAN
How is he doing it?

DEAN and SAM walk away. JESSE watches them go.

MOTEL
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

DEAN, still in his suit though without the jacket, sits in bed, reading something that isn't John's journal. The door opens. DEAN looks up. SAM, still in his suit and jacket, closes the door.

SAM
So, dug up what I could on Jesse Turner. It's not much. Uh, B student, won last year's Pinewood Derby. But get this. Jesse was adopted. His birth records are sealed.

DEAN
So you unsealed them, and?

SAM
There's no father listed, but Jesse's biological mom is named Julia Wright. She lives in Elk Creek, on the other side of the state.

DEAN closes his book and throws it down on the bed.

JULIA'S HOUSE
EXT. RUNDOWN HOUSE – DAY

A sign reading "NO TRESPASSING" hangs on the gate of a rusty, overgrown fence. DEAN pushes the gate open and walks through, SAM right behind.

Elk Creek, Nebraska

SAM and DEAN walk around to the front door, which has two deadbolts. DEAN rings the doorbell. A woman, JULIA, speaks without opening the door.

JULIA
Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested.

DEAN looks at SAM.

DEAN
We're not salesmen. Agents Page and Plant, FBI.

DEAN and SAM pull out their badges and hold them up to the peephole.

JULIA
Put your badge in the slot. Your partner's, too.

DEAN obeys. A pause while the locks clatter. The door opens. JULIA hands back the badges.

JULIA
What do you want?

SAM
Um...

SAM and DEAN put their badges away.

SAM
We just had a few questions. About your son.

JULIA
I don't have a son.

SAM
He was born March twenty-ninth, nineteen ninety-eight, in Omaha.

JULIA looks up, face expressionless.

SAM
You put him up for adoption?

JULIA
What about him?

SAM
We were just wondering, um, was it...was it a normal pregnancy?

JULIA says nothing.

DEAN
Was there anything strange?

JULIA slams the door.

JULIA
Stay away from me!

DEAN
Mrs. Wright, wait!

DEAN pushes the door open and he and SAM follow JULIA inside. JULIA runs to the kitchen and shuts the door, but quickly realizes she can't hold it shut against two large men and retreats. DEAN pushes the door open.

DEAN
We just want to talk!

JULIA grabs a canister of table salt, wrenches it open, and tosses the contents at DEAN and SAM. When it hits them, nothing happens. JULIA stares; this isn't what she expected. DEAN and SAM stare back.

JULIA
You're not demons?

DEAN
How do you know about demons?

JULIA'S PAST
INT. DINING ROOM – DAY

JULIA sits at the table with a cup of tea. She sets the cup on a saucer and folds her arms.

JULIA
I was possessed. A demon took control of my body, and I hurt people. I killed people.

SAM and DEAN are sitting across from JULIA.

SAM
That, that wasn't you.

JULIA
But I was there. I heard a woman beg for mercy. I...felt a young girl's blood drip down my hands.

DEAN
That's how you knew about the salt.

JULIA
Yeah, I picked up tricks. It was in my head for months.

DEAN
How many months?

JULIA
Nine.

SAM
So your son...

JULIA
Yeah, the whole time. The pregnancy, birth—all of it. I was possessed.

INT. EMPTY ROOM – NIGHT

Past-JULIA, heavily pregnant, lies on the floor, screaming. JULIA narrates the flashback in voiceover, with cuts back to the present day.

JULIA
The night the baby was born, I was alone. And the pain was—the pain was overwhelming. I, I screamed, and it came out a laugh, because the demon was happy. It used my body to give birth to a child. When it was over, something changed. Maybe the—the demon was tired or if the pain helped me fight it, but...

Past-JULIA has demon-black eyes.

JULIA
Somehow, I took control.

Past-JULIA squeezes her eyes shut and opens them: they're human. She pants, exhausted.

JULIA
And the demon wailed inside me. It pounded against my skull. I thought my head was gonna explode. But I knew. I knew what I had to do.

Past-JULIA grabs fistfuls out of a bag of road salt and pours it down her throat. Black smoke rushes out of her.

JULIA
And when I was alone with the baby...

A baby cries.

JULIA
A part of me...part of me wanted to kill it.

INT. DINING ROOM – DAY

The flashback is over.

JULIA
But, God help me, I couldn't do that. So, I put it up for adoption, and I ran.

DEAN
Who was the father?

JULIA
I was a virgin.

DEAN and SAM look at each other.

JULIA
Have you seen my son? Is he human?

DEAN
His name's Jesse. He lives in, uh, Alliance. He's a good kid.

JULIA nods.

EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE – DAY

SAM and DEAN leave.

SAM
So, now what?

DEAN
We need help.

MOTEL
INT. MOTEL – NIGHT

SAM and DEAN enter the motel room. They both look up: CASTIEL is waiting for them.

SAM
I take it you got our message.

SAM sits at the table. DEAN closes the door.

CASTIEL
It's lucky you found the boy.

DEAN
Oh, yeah, real lucky. What do we do with him?

CASTIEL
Kill him.

SAM pauses in the middle of loosening his tie. He and DEAN stare at CASTIEL. CASTIEL stares back.

DEAN
Cas.

CASTIEL
This child is half demon and half human, but it's far more powerful than either. Other cultures call this hybrid cambion or katako. You know him as the antichrist.

CASTIEL sits at the table. Fart noises. The noises continue as CASTIEL shifts position. DEAN watches, raising his eyebrows.

CASTIEL
That wasn't me.

CASTIEL pulls out a whoopee cushion, presumably the one DEAN bought earlier.

DEAN
Who put that there?

SAM
Anyway, I don't get it. Jesse is the devil's son?

CASTIEL sighs.

CASTIEL
No, of course not. Your Bible gets more wrong than it does right. The antichrist is not Lucifer's child. It's just demon spawn. But it is one of the devil's greatest weapons in the war against heaven.

DEAN
Well, if Jesse's a demonic howitzer, then what the hell's he doing in Nebraska?

CASTIEL
The demons lost him. They can't find him. But they're looking.

DEAN
And they lost him because?

CASTIEL
Because of the child's power. It hides him from both angels and demons. For now.

DEAN
So he's got, like, a force field around him. Well, that's great. Problem solved.

CASTIEL
With Lucifer risen, this child grows strong. Soon, he will do more than just make a few toys come to life—something that will draw the demons to him. The demons will find this child. Lucifer will twist this boy to his purpose. And then, with a word, this child will destroy the Host of Heaven.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. You're saying that—that Jesse's gonna nuke the angels?

CASTIEL
We cannot allow that to happen.

SAM
Wait.

SAM stands up.

SAM
We're the good guys. We—we don't just—kill children.

CASTIEL
A year ago, you would have done whatever it took to win this war.

SAM
Things change.

DEAN steps forward, putting a hand on SAM's arm and putting himself between SAM and CASTIEL.

DEAN
Okay. Hey, look, we are not going to kill him. All right? But we can't leave Jesse here either. We know that. So...we take him to Bobby's. He'll know what to do.

CASTIEL
You'll kidnap him? What is going on in this town, it's what happens when this thing is happy. You cannot imagine what it will do if it's angry. Besides, how will you hold him? With a thought, he could be halfway around the world.

DEAN
So we—

SAM
So we tell him the truth. You say Jesse's destined to go dark side—fine. But he hasn't yet. So if we lay it all out for him—what he is, the apocalypse, everything—he might make the right choice.

A long pause.

CASTIEL
You didn't. And I can't take that chance.

SAM glares. CASTIEL vanishes. SAM sighs.

SAM
Damn it.

JULIA'S HOUSE
EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE – NIGHT

JULIA walks up to her door, then unlocks each of the locks. A MAILMAN walks up behind her. She turns around and gasps, startled.

JULIA
Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry.

MAILMAN
It's—it's no worries. You okay?

JULIA
Yeah. It's just today—a little...shaky.

MAILMAN
Ah. Well, talking to the Winchesters will do that to you.

JULIA's expression changes: no one should know that. The MAILMAN steps forward, pressing JULIA against the door.

MAILMAN
Don't you recognize me, sweetheart?

The MAILMAN's eyes go black: this is a DEMON, presumably the same one that once possessed JULIA.

DEMON
We had some great times together, didn't we? And then you stole something from us, hid it away. That was very, very naughty of you. So we watched, and we waited. And now...they told you where he is, didn't they? I think it's time we go and visit our son.

The DEMON holds JULIA's mouth open. Black smoke pours out of the MAILMAN's mouth into JULIA's, while the MAILMAN leans forward as if for a kiss. When the last of the black smoke is out of the MAILMAN, he drops like a stone. JULIA's eyes go black, and the DEMON walks forward.

JESSE'S HOUSE
INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

JESSE gets a cup of water from a five-gallon jug. CASTIEL appears. JESSE backs away, dropping the glass, which smashes.

CASTIEL
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

CASTIEL advances, Ruby's knife held behind his back. JESSE continues to back away.

JESSE
Mom! Dad!

CASTIEL
Your mother and father are sleeping. I assure you, they won't wake until morning.

JESSE breathes hard.

CASTIEL
I'm sorry.

CASTIEL raises the knife.

DEAN and SAM kick in the front door. JESSE stares at them.

DEAN
Was there a guy here? In a trench coat?

JESSE points at the floor: there is an action figure wearing CASTIEL's suit and trench coat and holding a silver knife. DEAN kneels to pick him up and looks up at SAM, then JESSE.

ACT FOUR
INT. JESSE'S LIVING ROOM – DAY

DEAN sets the CASTIEL action figure on the mantelpiece. JESSE is sitting on the couch, SAM on a chair.

JESSE
Was he your friend?

DEAN
Him? No.

JESSE
I did that. But how did I do that?

DEAN
You're a superhero.

JESSE
I am?

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, who else could turn someone into a toy? You're Superman—minus the cape and the go-go boots. See, my—my partner and I, we work for a secret government agency. It's our job to find kids with special powers. In fact, we're here to take you to a hidden base in South Dakota, where you'll be trained to fight evil.

JESSE
Like the X-Men?

DEAN
Exactly like the X-Men.

DEAN chuckles.

DEAN
In fact, the, uh, guy we're taking you to—he's even in a wheelchair. You'll be a hero. You'll save lives. You'll get the girl. Sounds like fun, right?

DEAN is flung against the wall. The DEMON possessing JULIA walks in.

DEMON
They're lying to you.

SAM stands up. The DEMON flings him against the wall with DEAN. JESSE stands up.

DEMON
Stay right there, dreamboat. Can't hurt you. Orders. You, on the other hand? Hurting you's encouraged.

The DEMON flicks her wrist and slams DEAN against the opposite wall, then back.

DEAN
No! Uh!

JESSE
Leave him alone!

The DEMON leans down to JESSE, speaking sweetly.

DEMON
Jesse. You're beautiful. You have your father's eyes.

JESSE
Who are you?

DEMON
I'm your mother.

JESSE
No, you're not.

DEMON
Mm-hm. You're half human...half one of us.

DEAN
She means demons, Jesse!

The DEMON straightens and holds up a hand clenched into a fist. DEAN groans in pain. The DEMON leans back down to JESSE.

DEMON
Those people you call your parents—they lied to you, too. You're not theirs—not really.

JESSE
My mom and dad love me.

DEMON
Do they? Is—is that why they leave you alone all day? Because they love you so much? These people—these imposters—they told you that the tooth fairy was real and that your toys could hurt you and a hundred other things that aren't true. They love you so much, they made your whole life a lie. Look into your heart, Jesse. You've always known you weren't theirs. You've always known you were different. Everyone has lied to you. They're not FBI agents. And you're not a superhero.

JESSE
Then what am I?

DEMON
You're powerful. You can have anything you want. You can do anything you want.

DEAN
Don't listen to her, Jesse!

The DEMON holds up a hand and DEAN groans.

DEMON
They treated you like a child. Nobody trusted you. Everybody's lied to you. Doesn't that make you angry?

JESSE clenches his fist. The room rattles. The DEMON looks up, exultant. The fire flares up and the lights flicker.

DEMON
See? It does make you angry. But I'm telling you the truth, Jesse.

Things begin to shatter.

DEMON
Wouldn't it be better if there were no lies? Come with me and you can wash it all clean. Start over. Imagine that—a world without lies.

SAM
She's right. We lied to you.

The DEMON looks at SAM, eyes black.

SAM
But I'll tell you the truth.

The DEMON raises a fist. Something crunches. SAM tries to speak through the pressure on his throat.

SAM
I just want...to tell...

JESSE
Stop it.

SAM drops to the floor, released. He gasps in breath

JESSE
I want to hear what he has to say.

DEMON
You're stronger than I thought.

SAM stands up.

SAM
We lied to you. And I'm sorry. So here's the truth. I'm Sam Winchester. That's my brother, Dean. W-we hunt monsters.

DEMON
Except when you are the monster. Right, Sammy?

SAM
And that woman right there, her name is Julia. She's your mother. But the thing inside of her, the thing that you're talking to—it's a demon.

JESSE
A demon?

DEMON
He's done nothing but lie to you since the moment you met him. Don't listen to him. Punish him.

JESSE
Sit down and shut up.

A chair scoots up behind the DEMON, who is forced into it, silent. She struggles to speak.

SAM
There's, uh, kind of a...a war between angels and demons, and...you're a part of it.

JESSE
I'm just a kid.

SAM
You can go with her if you want. I can't stop you. No one can. But if you do...millions of people will die.

JESSE
She said I was half demon. Is that true?

SAM
Yes. But you're half human, too. You can do the right thing. You've got choices, Jesse. But if you make the wrong ones, it'll haunt you for the rest of your life.

JESSE
Why are you telling me this?!

SAM
Because I have to believe someone can make the right choice, even if I couldn't.

JESSE thinks about this. He clenches his fist and looks at the DEMON.

JESSE
Get out of her.

The chair flies back against the wall. Black smoke pours out of JULIA's mouth and vanishes up the chimney. DEAN drops to the ground, panting.

DEAN
How did you do that?

JESSE
I just did.

DEAN
Kid...you're awesome.

EPILOGUE
JESSE'S HOUSE
INT. JESSE'S LIVING ROOM – DAY

JESSE looks at JULIA, slumped in the chair.

JESSE
Is she gonna be all right?

DEAN looks at JULIA.

DEAN
Eventually.

DEAN leans down and picks up the CASTIEL action figure, which fell down at some point.

DEAN
Look, uh, truth is, he's kind of a buddy of mine. Is there any way you could turn him back?

JESSE
He tried to kill me.

DEAN
Right. Uh. But he's a—he's a good guy. He was just confused.

JESSE says nothing.

DEAN
Okay. It's been a long night. We'll...talk about it later.

DEAN puts the CASTIEL action figure back on the mantel.

JESSE
What now?

DEAN looks back at SAM.

DEAN
Now we take you someplace safe, get you trained up. You'd be handy in a fight, kid.

JESSE
What if I don't want to fight?

SAM
Jesse.

SAM comes forward to sit in front of JESSE.

SAM
You're powerful. More powerful than...pretty much anything we've ever seen. That makes you—

JESSE
A freak.

SAM
To some people, maybe. But not to us. See, we're kind of freaks ourselves.

JESSE
I can't stay here, can I?

DEAN
No. The demons know where you are, and more will be coming.

JESSE
I won't go without my mom and dad.

SAM
There's nothing more important than family. We get that. And if you really want to take them with you, we'll back your play. But you got to understand—it's gonna be dangerous for them, too.

JESSE
What do you mean?

DEAN
Our dad...he would take us with him wherever he went.

JESSE
Where is he now?

SAM
Dead. A demon killed him.

DEAN
Look, Jesse...once you're in this fight...

DEAN leans down to JESSE.

DEAN
You're in it till the end, win or lose.

JESSE
What should I do?

SAM
We can't tell you. It's your choice. It's not fair. I know.

JESSE
Can I go see my parents? I, I need to...say goodbye.

DEAN
Sure.

JESSE climbs the stairs.

INT. JESSE'S PARENTS' BEDROOM – NIGHT

JESSE peeks into the room and sees his parents asleep in bed. He looks at them for a moment and closes the door.

INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

JESSE flops down on his bed, then sits up, looking at a poster on his wall: it shows a surfer and says AUSTRALIA.

INT. JESSE'S LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

SAM examines the CASTIEL action figure and puts him back on the mantel without any of the care DEAN showed.

DEAN
He's been up there a long time.

INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

SAM and DEAN enter the room. It's empty.

CASTIEL
He's gone.

SAM and DEAN turn; CASTIEL is behind them.

SAM
Where?

CASTIEL
I don't know. Jesse put everyone in town back to normal—the ones still alive. Then he vanished.

SAM notices a note on JESSE's bed and picks it up.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN
What does it say?

SAM
That he had to leave to keep his parents safe, that he loves them, and he's sorry.

DEAN
How do we find him?

CASTIEL
With the boy's powers, we can't. Not unless he wants to be found.

IMPALA
EXT. STREET – NIGHT

The Impala drives past.

INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN
You think Jesse's gonna be okay?

SAM takes a deep breath.

SAM
I hope so.

DEAN
You know, we destroyed that kid's life by telling him the truth.

SAM
We didn't have a choice, Dean.

DEAN
Yeah. You know, I'm starting to get why parents lie to their kids. You want them to believe that the worst thing out there is mixing Pop Rocks and Coke—protect them from the real evil. You want them going to bed feeling safe. If that means lying to them, so be it. The more I think about it...the more I wish Dad had lied to us.

SAM
Yeah, me too.
