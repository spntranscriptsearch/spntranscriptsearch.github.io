TEASER
[Episode opens with a wide shot of a farm at night. The tagline reads "Grantsburg, Wisconsin." We hear a creature snarling and flesh tearing. Cows lowing loudly and bells clanking from the barn. The house door opens and a man runs out with a shotgun.]


FARMER [Shotgun cocks]

Hey!


[A figure rushes from the barn and the FARMER gives chase, shooting at him but missing and hitting the fence. They run through the woods with the FARMER shooting after the fleeing figure. Suddenly the person runs out on a road; tires screech and a horn blares. The car hits the person full on and he flips over the roof and rolls, bloody and unconscious. We finally see his face and it is GARTH.]


TITLE CARD


ACT ONE
[Scene opens with a front view of the Grantsburg Memorial Hospital. SAM, in a FBI suit walks in the front doors. Camera changes to inside and the front desk. Sam approaches the receptionist.]


SAM [showing his badge]

Afternoon. I'm looking for a John Doe that was admitted here a few days ago. He's a, uh... skinny...Ichabod Crane-looking kind of guy.


RECEPTIONIST

I know just who you mean. Room 113, agent.


SAM

All right, thanks.


RECEPTIONIST [to herself]

Sure is a popular fella.


[Scene changes to GARTH, still unconscious in a hospital room. DEAN is there with a syringe. He is about to put something in GARTH's IV. But when he hears the door open he quickly hides the needle behind his back. SAM walks in. He shoots DEAN an annoyed look and DEAN returns the glare. There is a long silence as both brothers watch the unconscious GARTH and exchange wary looks with each other.]


SAM [finally]

Saw Garth's John Doe on the police wire. You?


DEAN

Yeah. Where you comin' from?


SAM

New Mexico.


DEAN

Well, that's a haul. Especially considering that I got this, uh... pretty much covered, so if you want to...

[Clicks tongue and motions to the door]


SAM

You spoken to him yet?


DEAN

No. Assload of painkillers. He's been out since I got here.


SAM [noticing that GARTH is handcuffed to the bed]

What's he being charged with?


DEAN

Killing a cow.


SAM

Why?


DEAN

I was about to see if I could find out. Lock the door.


[SAM move to lock the door but rushes back when DEAN pulls the syringe from behind his back.]


SAM

Whoa. Hey. What is that? Adrenaline?


DEAN

Yes, sir.


SAM

You trying to jump-start him or kill him?


DEAN

I want some answers. He walked out on Kevin. He walked out on us. So if you got a better idea...


[SAM sighs and then slaps GARTH full in the face. GARTH shoots awake, screaming.]


GARTH [completely confused]

Aah! Aah! Aah! Dean? Sam? What is this? A hospital? Wait. Am I in Heaven?


DEAN

All right, take it easy, Garth. You're in Wisconsin.


SAM

You were hit by a car. Do you remember anything?


GARTH [Groans]

I, uh... Vaguely. [He pulls he hand up to hold his head but its stopped by the handcuffs] What's with the hardware?


[Sam unlocks the cuffs and removes them]


DEAN

You tell us. And while you're at it, why don't you give us the lowdown on why you went AWOL for the past six months? Only way we tracked you down is that you offed a cow.


GARTH

Offed a...what? I -- I -- I was on a hunt.


SAM

Hunt for what?


GARTH

I -- oh, no. [GARTH turns green and looks like he is going to throw up.] Oh, get back. Ohh. Oh, God. [In a panic he pulls all the monitors and IV off, jumps out of bed and rushes to the bathroom; shutting the door behind him. We hear gagging and retching.]


DEAN

Good thing I didn't give him the adrenaline.

[Short time later the boys are sitting in the room and Garth is still vomiting and coughing in the bathroom. The silence is deafening so they start to make small talk.]


DEAN

Anything on Gadreel?


SAM

Actually, uh, yeah. Turns out he, uh, he left some Grace in me before he bolted.


DEAN

You know how wrong that sounds, right?


SAM

Wouldn't worry about it. Cas took care of it.


DEAN [Chuckles]

Hmm.


SAM

What?


DEAN

Nothing. I'm gone for two weeks, and you're like an episode of "Teen Mom."


[From the bathroom: retching and coughing]


DEAN

Just breathe, Garth! Work it out.


[SAM notices a part of a scar on DEAN's arm]


SAM

What happened to your arm?


DEAN [pulls up his sleeve so he can see it better]

Oh. It's a... gift from Cain.


SAM

Like...the wrestler?


DEAN

I wish. That would be awesome. Uh, no. The, uh...The Old Testament dude.

[Toilet flushes in the bathroom]


He got all Biblical on me and gave me his mark.


SAM

What does it even mean? How -- how did that happen?


DEAN

Crowley and I found him, and he gave me this so that I could eighty-six Abaddon once and for all.


SAM

You worked a job with Crowley?


DEAN

The devil you know...


[Suddenly realizing there are no sounds coming from the bathroom.]


SAM

Garth?


DEAN

What?


[They rush into the bathroom. GARTH is nowhere to be found and the window is wide open.]


DEAN

Son of a bitch.


[Scene switches to outside the hospital and the WINCHESTERS walk quickly out. They are both looking around for any sign of GARTH.]


DEAN

Why would Garth run from us?


SAM

Why haven't we heard from him for the last six months? Did you test him?


DEAN

He was unconscious. No, I -- he steal a car?


SAM [noticing a pair of boxers on the ground]

Did he... steal a car naked?


DEAN [taps SAM and points to the roof]

I'll see what I can find on those cameras. Why don't you go talk to farmer Brown, see about that cow?


SAM

Yeah.


[Scene changes to SAM at the FARMER's house and he is fixing the shot fence which SAM stands by.]


FARMER

Last week, it was a couple of chickens. Goat the week before that. So when I saw that boy tearing out of my barn, hell yeah, I was gonna ask questions later.


SAM

Now, the animals -- were they all killed in the same manner?


FARMER

More like sacrificed.


SAM

What do you mean by that?


FARMER

Their organs was ripped clean out.


SAM

Only the organs.


FARMER

If this wasn't some kind of devil-worship thing, I don't know what.


SAM

Mm. Well, thanks.


[Scene switches to DEAN walking out of the hospital with several papers and photos in his hand. His cellphone rings.]


DEAN

Yeah.



SAM [on the phone]

So, the cow wasn't just killed. It was eviscerated.


DEAN

Well, why was Garth there?


SAM [we see he's standing by some trees]

He said he was on a hunt, right? Maybe he was hunting whatever killed it.


DEAN [back at the hospital]

Why would he run? This whole thing's starting to stink. You know that, right?


SAM

Yeah. What about you? Any luck?


DEAN

Uh, nada. Cameras were pointing in the wrong direction.


SAM [unconvinced]

You're kidding.


DEAN

Wish I was.


SAM

Hmm. So...


DEAN

...so Garth's a hunter. If he wants to stay gone, he's gone.


SAM

We got nothing?


DEAN

Well, what can I say, Sammy? We lost this one. Send me a postcard.


[DEAN walks around an ambulance and runs right into SAM who immediately snatches the photos out of his hand. SAM looks through them and they are perfect shots of GARTH and his escape. There are pictures of the car he got into and full shots of the license plate.]


SAM [angry]

Wow. Make, model, license plate. Really, Dean?


DEAN

I told you we can't hunt together. It's for your own good.


SAM

I hear you. And after we find Garth and get to the bottom of this, I'm gone. But until then, no more games.


DEAN [nods]

Ride belongs to a girl named Bess Meyers. She lives in the next town over.


[Scene immediatly switches to DEAN and SAM kicking BESS's door down; guns drawn. GARTH is inside.]


GARTH

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Hey, guys. I can explain. Everything's cool. Just a simple misunderstanding.


DEAN

Who you talking to?


GARTH

What?


DEAN

The girl?


GARTH

What -- what girl? What the --


[DEAN pointedly grabs a bra from the table and holds it up.]


GARTH

What, now?


[DEAN motions SAM to the right and he goes left. They swiftly clear the room. They find no one.]


GARTH

All right, all right. Guys, everyone needs to take a chill pill and put their guns down. You see? Let's all be grown-ups here and have an adult conversation.


[Suddenly a female werewolf leaps from the closet behind SAM and attacks him. DEAN looks for a shot but GARTH tackles the gun from him.]


GARTH

No!


[GARTH leaps between SAM and the werewolf as SAM nicks her with a silver knife and the wound burns.]


GARTH

Sam! Sam, please -- don't hurt her.


DEAN

What are you doing?! She's a werewolf!


GARTH

So am I.

ACT TWO
[GARTH and the werewolf sit on the couch as he tends to her arm.]


GARTH

It's okay, baby. Hold it like that.


SHE-WEREWOLF

What are they doing here, Garth?


GARTH

They're friends. I promise.


SHE-WEREWOLF

They're hunters.


GARTH

All right. We've all gotten off on the wrong foot here. So let's do things right. Boys...this is Bess...my beloved. And, Bess, that's Dean. Now, he could start a fight in an empty house, but deep down inside, he's just a big ol' Teddy bear. [DEAN looks annoyed and SAM chuckles] And Sam here -- Sam can be a bit insecure at times, [SAM glares] but for good reason. Bless his heart.


DEAN

That's sweet. Werewolf?


GARTH

All right, guys, look -- about six months ago, I was outside Portland, Maine, hunting this big bad wolf.

I took him down, but... He bit me in the process.


DEAN

And you didn't call one of us?


GARTH

And tell you what? That I messed up? No, I-I knew the deal. There's no cure, so I accepted my fate. Ate my favorite dish of egg fu Yung, watched the world's greatest movie, "Rocky III"" and then... was ready to eat a bullet, when Bess here found me.


SAM

And how'd she do that?


BESS

Smelled him. How else?


GARTH

Yeah. She talked the gun out of my mouth, and, as they say, the rest is history. We've been married for four months now.


SAM

You're married?


DEAN

To a werewolf.


BESS

Yes. And my pack has taken him in as one of our own.


GARTH

Guys, it's not what you think. We don't hurt people.


DEAN

No, you just go all Wolverine on cattle.


GARTH

Yeah.


BESS

At least he's not eating human hearts. Do you have any idea how hard it is for a bitten to control his instincts, like Garth does? How well he's doing?


GARTH

Thank you, baby.


BESS

Well, it's the truth, honey bunny.


SAM

Wait. A -- a "bitten"? You're all bitten.


BESS

Not at all. You're either born to it, like I was, or you're bitten, like Garth.


DEAN

Hold on. You said you were -- you were born a werewolf?


BESS

Second generation.


DEAN

Garth, can we talk to you for a sec? Alone?


GARTH [to BESS]

Honey, why don't you go find some ointment for that arm? Okay?


[BESS nods and leaves the room]


DEAN

What the hell?


GARTH

Look, I know you guys want to shoot first and ask questions later, but I checked everything out. This pack is clean. Everything's Kosher.


SAM

Right. Uh, minus the part where your wife attacked me.


GARTH

Yeah, because you two came busting in here like a house on fire. Guns waving, the jawlines and the hair -- it's very intimidating! What'd you expect? Dean, no one wants any trouble. You got my word on that.


DEAN

Oh, no. That ship has sailed. We're gonna need a hell of a lot more than your word.


GARTH

Okay. Okay. Tell you what. You want proof? Come pray with us.


[DEAN and SAM exchange looks]


[The IMPALA pulls up outside a farmhouse. DEAN gets out and walks back to the trunk as his phone rings. It's SAM. We see SAM walk out of the police station. The camera switches back and forth as they talk.]


SAM

You there?


DEAN

Yeah, just pulled up. Nothing too sketchy yet.


SAM

That's a good thing, right?


DEAN

Not betting on it.


SAM

Or are we just that jaded? I mean, maybe Garth's right.


DEAN

Well, ain't you a glass half full. Any luck with the cops?


SAM

Uh, sheriff should be rolling up any second. Be careful.


DEAN

Yeah.


[DEAN hangs up and approches the house. A choir is singing inside. They stop and a man's voice says "We need to come in strong on the second verse. Let's try it again. Garth, play it from here. And..." The singing resumes. DEAN walks up the stairs and knocks on the front door. A woman answers it.]


WOMAN

You must be Dean. I'm Joy, Garth's mother-in-law. Uh, stepmother-in-law, which I always thought

sounded so silly. Please, come in. We're just finishing up.


DEAN [looking greatly uncomfortable and on edge]

Why don't you just tell Garth I'm here?


JOY

Dean, you have my word -- you're safe under my roof. I only ask the same in return. After all...I'm not the one carrying silver.


[DEAN slowly enters and walks to the doorway of the living room still looking very uncomforable. JOY joins the group in the room singing.]


GROUP

♪ Bringing in the sheaves

♪ bringing in the sheaves

♪ we shall come rejoicing

♪ bringing in the sheaves

♪ bringing in the sheaves

♪ bringing in the sheaves

♪ bringing in the sheaves

[GARTH plays an off-key conclusion on the piano and DEAN chuckles slightly]


GROUP LEADER

Uh... Thank you, brother Garth. Wonderful accompaniment, as usual. And I'll see the rest of you in the pews -- 9:00 a.m., sharp. No stragglers...Sister Amelia.


[ Laughter ]


GARTH [joining DEAN at the doorway]

Oh. Hi. So, what'd I tell you? It's all good, right?


DEAN [in low tones]

Everyone here's a wolf?


GARTH

Yeah.


DEAN

Yeah, not all good.


GARTH

Oh, come on, Dean. You just got to meet them. [GARTH points out to men] That's Russ and Joba, Bess' first cousins on sister Joy's side. [RUSS and JOBA wave. GARTH points out the GROUP LEADER] That's Reverend Jim, Bess' dad -- leader of the pack and a good man.


REVEREND JIM [coming over and holding out his hand]

"Dean," isn't it? Welcome. Jim Meyers. Folks usually call me...


DEAN [not shaking his hand]

Reverend Jim. Yeah, I got it.


GARTH [chuckling uncomfortably]

Oh. Uh, my bad. Dean's got this crazy fear of germs.


REVEREND JIM

I understand your apprehension, Dean. Hunters and our kind don't have the best history together.


JOY [standing by her husband]

But I think you'll find we're not much different from you.


DEAN

Oh, sister, I highly doubt it.


REVEREND JIM

Why don't we break bread and see?


DEAN

Why would I do that?


[REVEREND JIM and JOY sigh and then leave for the diningroom. GARTH is shocked at DEAN's rudeness.


GARTH

Dean!


DEAN

What?


[A short time later all are seated at the table and JOY is serving raw animal organs to the entire table but DEAN who has an overcooked steak, corn and a burnt biscuit. DEAN watches with an almost sick look.]


JOY

Now, everybody eat up. But make sure you leave room for pie.


REVEREND JIM

Sister Joy's pies are famous throughout the badger state.


GARTH [eating]

Mm. Dean loves pie.


[DEAN glares daggers at him for even mention that fact. He continues to watch the people around the table hungrily enjoying the raw meat. He continues to look more sick and uncomfortable by the second.]


DEAN

Don't you guys say some sort of a Grace or something?


REVEREND JIM

We're more spiritual than we are religious. We believe, much like the American Indians did, that nature and man are one.


DEAN

Yeah, really worked out well for them.


[GARTH glares at him and DEAN tries a different tactic after seeing silver bullets hanging around every person's neck.]


DEAN

So, why are a bunch of werewolves wearing silver bullets around their necks?


GARTH

[Coughs]

Sorry, Dean, but we don't use the "W" word around here. We prefer the term "lycanthrope."


DEAN [pointedly]

"We"?


REVEREND JIM

He's entitled to his opinion, Garth.


BESS

Many of our kind see themselves as indestructible. This is a constant reminder of how precious our lives truly are.


DEAN

Yeah, but it's silver. I mean, doesn't it burn?


GARTH

Yeah, it does a bit, but that's kind of the point. It reminds us of our fragility.


REVEREND JIM

My daughter, Bess, was born a lycanthrope. It was one of the proudest days of my life. [Inhales deeply]

Which soon turned tragic... When a hunter killed my wife. Believe me when I tell you, I wanted to make someone pay. Then I looked at Bess, and I realized the road to revenge is a dark and lonely one, which you never get off. And that hole in the pit of your stomach, you never fill it -- ever.


DEAN

Hey, no, I get it.


REVEREND JIM

So I chose to look forward, not backwards. And the minute I did that, the powers that be brought this beautiful, compassionate, amazing woman into my life. [He smiles at JOY] And she helped me raise a little baby girl as if Bess were her own.


JOY

I can't take all the credit. Daddy had a hand in it, too. He saw your potential.


DEAN

Daddy?


JOY

My father -- bless his soul -- was the previous reverend of our church, the third generation in our family to serve.


DEAN

So, you're fourth-generation werewolf?


JOY

Yes.


[Scene switches to SAM talking to the SHERIFF outside the police station.]


SHERIFF

Look, the good Reverend Jim and his family are all a little new-agey and hippie-dippy like, but they're clean as a whistle and pillars of our community. Why is the FBI even interested in them?


SAM

I just go where they send me, sheriff. Truth be told, I'm more interested in, uh... murders and "X-files"-y stuff. Anything of that variety around here?


SHERIFF [Chuckles]

No, sir. We're just a small town. Not much crime of any to speak of. I'm sorry, agent. I wish I could be more help.


SAM

Ah, that's all right. But if you do think of something, give me a call.


SHERIFF

Will do.


[Back at REVEREND JIM's house, DEAN opens the fridge and sees platters of raw organs. He turns around when he hears people behind him. He turns to see RUSS and JOBA.]


RUSS

Still hungry?


DEAN

Yeah, I was just, uh... seeing if you had any beer.


RUSS [They move in threateningly pinning DEAN in the corner. DEAN keeps his gaze steady.]

The sooner you realize that all is good here, the sooner you can go.


DEAN [evenly]

Don't you two have a chew toy or something to go play with?


GARTH [coming into the room]

Hey, guys. You mind if I grab a second with Dean, here?


[RUSS and JOBA leave and GARTH and DEAN move to a window.]


GARTH

Why are you being so hard on everyone?


DEAN

Because there's no way that all of this is what it looks like. No way.


GARTH

Why not?


DEAN

Come on, man. I know you drank the kool-aid, okay? But come on.


GARTH

Look, amigo... I know this is all looks nuts, but I found it. Love and a family? Who cares where that comes from?


DEAN

I do.


GARTH

I get it. When I first got here, I couldn't let go, either. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. But when it didn't, I had to accept the truth.


DEAN

Well, I got another truth for you -- we were all left in the dark when you went AWOL. I didn't know whether you were dead or worse. You should have reached out and sent someone a message.


GARTH

And said what, Dean? That I was a werewolf? I was embarrassed. I thought it best for everyone if I just stayed away. But that doesn't mean that I didn't think about and miss you and Sam... Kevin.


[At Kevin's name, DEAN meets GARTH's eyes and there is a empty blankness to his eyes. GARTH immediately knows something is wrong.]


DEAN [softly]

Kevin's gone.


GARTH

What?


DEAN

Gone for good.


GARTH

What happened?


DEAN [sorrowfully]

When he needed me, I wasn't there. That's what.


[That night DEAN and SAM are outside REVEREND JIM's house leaning against the IMPALA watching the house.]


SAM

Okay, Dean, they gave you lunch, they gave you pie. Why are we still here?


DEAN

Uh, yeah, you're right. Yeah, Garth's good. You want to hit the road, it's square by me.


SAM

Look, I'm just saying, this wouldn't be the first time we came across a friendly monster. Or a-a family of friendly monsters -- whatever this is.


[SAM's cell phone rings ]


SAM [answers]

Agent Perry.

...

Sheriff.

... [DEAN watches his brother]

How can I help you?

...

Really?

... [SAM motions for them to hit the road]

Okay.


[The IMPALA rolls up to a side of a field where the SHERIFF is standing looking at a gutted deer. The WINCHESTERS get out and walk up,]


SHERIFF

Well, you wanted weird, agent. You tell me what tore up that deer. Nothing that runs in these parts.


[DEAN and SAM walk over to the deer and squat down to look at it closer. They have their backs to the SHERIFF.]


DEAN

Fresh blood.


SHERIFF

Yes, it is.


[The SHERIFF takes his hand out of his pockets and the nails grow long as the SHERIFF turns into a WEREWOLF.]

ACT THREE
DEAN [quietly to SAM]

Still warm. That means it died after we got the call.


[SAM's puts it together as well and they swing around. DEAN pulls a silver knife out of his jeans but keeps it behind his back as the SHERIFF already has a gun trained on them.]


SHERIFF

Couldn't just accept that all was good and move on, could you? You have no idea what you've walked into, do you? No matter. You won't be walking out.


[The SHERIFF quickly draws his weapon but DEAN is faster. He throws the silver knife right into the SHERIFF's chest and he falls to the ground dead. The boys move to the body and DEAN removes his knife. SAM notices a silver bullet on a chain around his neck and yanks it off.]


SAM

Hey. Look at this.


DEAN

I've seen that before. Yeah, that is a favorite accessory of the good reverend and his flock.


SAM [reading a work etched into the bullet]

"Ragnarok"?


DEAN

Yeah, that's, uh, Thor, Loki, Odin stuff, right?


SAM

Yeah, it's Norse mythology's end of days. But why is it etched onto a bullet?


DEAN

Who cares? We got all the answers we need.


SAM

I don't know, Dean. I think we need more.


DEAN

Oh, what? Sheriff Andy Taylor here wasn't good enough for you?


SAM

Enough to kill Garth? Come on, man. Let's do this right.


DEAN

All right, fine. Clean this up, grab Garth, lock him up until we figure out what's what. I'm gonna go check out that church.


[The IMPALA pulls up to a white church and DEAN enters the sanctuary. He walks around pointing at things with his flashlight. SAM walks through the hallway leading to GARTH's apartment door. He rattles the handle put it is locked so he takes out his lock pick. DEAN enters REVEREND JIM's office and SAM enters GARTH's apartment which has been wreaked.]


SAM

Garth?


[DEAN finds a book about Norse mythology. He skims until he sees a chapter about Ragnarok. He turns on the desk lamp and shakes the computer mouse to wake up the screen. The monitor shows a picture of GARTH, BESS, JOY and REVEREND JIM.]


DEAN [rolls his eyes]

Seriously?


[He does a search for Ragnarok and starts to read about it. He cell phone rings and he picks it up.]


DEAN

Hey. Did you find the lovebirds?


SAM

No. Place is a wreck. No Garth, no Bess.


DEAN

What, they were taken? Well, that's fan-friggin'-tastic.


SAM

Tell me you got something.


DEAN

Well, this, uh...Ragnarok, end-of-days crap -- star of the story is a wolf named Fenris, who kills the God Odin before the world ends.


SAM

Okay. And that helps us how?


DEAN

There are cults that consider Fenris a wolf deity and worship him. They call themselves the maw of Fenris.


SAM

A cult of werewolves? [Chuckles] What do they want?


DEAN

Well, Ragnarok is not just a Bible story to these nutjobs. It's an action plan -- human extinction, total and complete werewolf domination.


SAM

And...what? This is the -- the ground-zero for their movement?


DEAN

Freakin' Wisconsin, man. Well, time for Reverend Jim to go down.


SAM

Yeah. Need any help?


DEAN

No, no, no, I got it. You just, uh, you find Garth.


SAM

All right.


[SAM goes to leave the apartment but is attacked and knocked unconscious with a tire iron. We see RUSS and JOBA. DEAN starts when he hears a car door shut and then REVEREND JIM enters the church. He walks up the isle but pauses when he smells DEAN.]


REVEREND JIM

It's no use, Dean. I can hear your heartbeat. You must've done this countless times, yet you still get nervous.


[DEAN steps out of the shadows with his gun drawn.]


DEAN

Nothing wrong with a little fear. It's what makes us human.


REVEREND JIM

Fear is not a purely human instinct. Even monsters know fear. I came to work on my sermon.


DEAN

Well, why don't you start by preaching to me about the maw of Fenris? Yeah, that's right. I know all about you and your pack's little plan.


REVEREND JIM

I assure you, we are planning nothing.


DEAN

No? Well, then, why did I read about it in your good book?


REVEREND JIM [Sighs]

Because generations ago, that hate and misplaced anger was part of our beliefs. But ever since I took over here, I have eradicated it from our congregation.


DEAN

Yeah, well, apparently, some of them didn't get the word -- like the good sheriff, who just tried to off me and my brother.


REVEREND JIM

Sheriff Pat?


DEAN

Let me see your bullet.

[DEAN pulls REVEREND JIM's silver bullet necklace closer but when he turns it around there is nothing etched on it.]

Where is it?


REVEREND JIM

Where's what?


DEAN

"Ragnarok."


REVEREND JIM

What?!


DEAN

It was etched into the sheriff's bullet.


REVEREND JIM

That's impossible. The maw is dead.


DEAN

Yeah, well, tell that to Garth and your daughter, who are missing.


REVEREND JIM [something suddenly dawning on him]

No.


[Scene changes to GARTH who is tied up against a ladder in a barn. He looks up to see BESS tied to a wagon wheel. She is struggling.]


GARTH

Bess.


[Door opens an RUSS and JOBA drag in an unconscious SAM and tie him to a tractor.]


GARTH

Sam.


BESS

What are you two doing? Russ? Joba?!

[She sees JOY walk in with a satisfied smile on her face.]

Mom? What is going on?


[JOY walks over to BESS and slapping her full in the face]


GARTH

Hey!


JOY

First off, I'm not your mother.


GARTH

You leave her alone! You hear me?! You want to hurt somebody, you hurt me!


JOY [Laughing]

Oh, that is so sweet. But I am going to hurt her. And him. [She points to SAM] But especially you, for bringing these hunters here. [Chuckling] I'm gonna hurt all of you.


GARTH [looking at BESS, voice breaking]

I'm sorry.

ACT FOUR
[DEAN rushes from the church trying to call his brother but SAM isn't picking up.]


DEAN

Sam, pick up, damn it!


[DEAN jumps into the IMPALA and squeals the tires as he speeds off.]


[Back in the barn, JOY is slapping GARTH]


GARTH

Unh! Please -- don't do this. Not to Bess. She's your daughter -- Unh!


JOY

How many times do I have to say this? "Stepdaughter"! I'm the last of my bloodline, thanks to you and your kind out there.


[SAM's head jerks as he starts to regain consciousness.]


RUSS

He's awake.


[SAM groans]


JOY [walking over]

Well, don't you just look good enough to eat.


SAM

Why are you doing this? I mean, me, I can understand, but these people are your family. Your pack.


JOY [motioning RUSS and JOBA to guard outside as she loads silver bullets into her gun]

Last winter, my little brother, Charlie, was killed by a hunter. [Inhales sharply] My husband counseled patience, restraint. Just as when he took over our beloved church, he preached a new direction -- lycanthropes and man would co-exist. Peace was more important than dominance. I tried so hard to make his way work... to be a preacher's wife. But then... Charlie was murdered. And I couldn't help remembering my daddy's sermons. And, by golly, turns out he was right. As long as there is a man, there can be no peace. Because man destroys. And I, for one, am sick of it.


[Outside the house, RUSS smells someone and walks around the hedge. DEAN's jacket is laying on the fence. RUSS turns to pick it up and DEAN stabs him in the back.]


SAM

I get it now. Why co-exist when you can rule?


JOY

Bingo. But my husband doesn't see it that way. See, he was bitten, not born into it, like I was. He still holds on to his humanity. Which is why I am so pleased it will be his claws that start Ragnarok, not mine. You and your brother coming here was a blessing from Fenris above. The two of you cornered Garth here, and then when Bess came running in to see what the fuss was about... [Gasps] You killed her.


GARTH

No!


JOY

Here. Silver to the heart.


GARTH [starting to turn to a werewolf]

[Growling]


SAM

You're gonna frame their murders on me.


JOY

My husband turned his cheek once. I don't think he can do it again.


[She walks over to BESS and points the gun at her]


GARTH

Hey! Get away from her!


JOY

Killing you gives me no joy, but Ragnarok -- it's bigger than all of us.


BESS

You're sick.


[JOY goes to pull the trigger but SAM stretches enough to kick the gun out of her hand. JOY pulls back in fierce anger]


JOY

You're just dying for me to get my claws dirty, aren't you?


[She turns to a werewolf and then we see DEAN slide in through the side door. But JOBA flies from the hayloft and tackles DEAN; sending his gun flying. They wrestle around in the hay but DEAN gets the upper hand and stabs JOBA. JOY turns to him.]


JOY

Wearing Russ' coat to hide your scent -- smart.


DEAN

Oh, I'm full of surprises.


JOY

As am I.


[DEAN and JOY both dive for their guns and draw them on each other. But DEAN is faster and shoots her in the chest. JOY gasps and then falls dead.]

ACT FIVE
[GARTH, SAM and DEAN watch as BESS comforts her father.]


SAM [to GARTH]

Be good. Hear me?


GARTH

I will. Thanks, Sam.


[SAM and GARTH hug and then SAM coldly glances at his brother as he walks by him through the door. DEAN's shoulders slump and his eyes follow his brother out the door but he covers quickly when GARTH walks up.]


DEAN [motioning at BESS and REVEREND JIM]

How's he doing?


GARTH

He's taking it pretty hard. Feels like he should have seen the signs earlier.


DEAN

Yeah, well, maybe you were right. Yeah, he seems like a good man...considering.


GARTH

Yeah. And you were right. Everything around here wasn't copacetic. I screwed up again. First Kevin, now this.


DEAN

Hey. Kevin? That's on me. I'm the one that pulled him into all this. I'm the one that should've been there to protect him.

GARTH

Well... I guess there's enough of that blame to go around, then.


[DEAN nods and heads for the door. GARTH stops him]

Dean.


DEAN

Yeah?


GARTH

Um...I know this may sound a little crazy, but... Maybe I could come back and hunt with you. I mean, with my werewolf mojo, we'd have an advantage.


DEAN

Yeah, look, Garth --


GARTH

No, Dean. I want to make this right. I never should've left you guys, especially Kevin. Kevin was my friend. Friends don't do that.


DEAN

Well, hey, you said it -- you know, who cares where happiness comes from? Look, we're all a little weird, we're all a little wacky -- some more than others -- but...if it works, it works. You got something here. Okay? Even though they are werewolves. Or Lycanthropes -- whatever. Don't let that go. Okay? You'll never forgive yourself. Besides, somebody's got to live to tell this damn story someday, and who better than you?

Now shut up and come here. [DEAN opens his arms for a hug.]


GARTH [surprised but grinning]

Really?


DEAN

Hurry up before I change my mind.


[They hug and DEAN leaves out the front door.]


[The IMPALA drives in to the parking lot of GARTH's apartments and pulls up to SAM's car. There is uncomfortable silence as SAM prepared to get out.]


SAM [opening the door and getting out]

I'll send you that postcard.


DEAN

Yeah.


[SAM almost reaches his car before DEAN gets up the nerve to get out as well.]


DEAN

Hey.

[SAM turns around]

Uh, listen, that night that, uh... You know, we went our -- our separate ways --


SAM

You mean the night you split?


DEAN [pauses, nods]

Fair enough.

I was messed up, man. Kevin was dead, and I...I don't know what I was.


SAM

Okay.


DEAN

Hell, maybe I still don't. But, uh... I know I took a piece of you in the process, and for that...[DEAN struggles to say the right thing. He finally just vents] Somebody changed the playbook, man, you know? It's like what -- what -- what's right is wrong and what's wrong is more wrong, and... I just know that when... When we rode together... [He pauses, looking for the right words.]


SAM [finishing his sentence]

We split the crappiness.


DEAN [sighs]

Yeah. So...


SAM [decides]

Okay.


DEAN

Okay.


SAM

But something's broken here, Dean.


DEAN

I'm not saying that it's not. I... I just think maybe we need to put a couple W's on the board and we get past all this.


SAM

I don't think so. No, I-I wish, but... We don't...see things the same way anymore -- our roles in this whole thing. Back in that church, talking me out of boarding up hell? Or -- or tricking me into letting Gadreel possess me? I can't trust you -- not the way I thought I could, not the way I should be able to.


DEAN

Okay, look. Whatever happened... We are family, okay?


SAM

You say that like it's some sort of cure-all, like it can change the fact that everything that has ever gone wrong between us has been because we're family.


DEAN

So, what -- we're not family now?


SAM

I'm saying, you want to work? Let's work. If you want to be brothers...[He pauses, letting DEAN fill in the blank] Those are my terms.


[DEAN stares at him in silence and then nods once. SAM gets back into the IMPALA and DEAN slowly follows.]
