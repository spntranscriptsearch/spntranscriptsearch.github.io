NOW
EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

ONE YEAR AGO

SAM and SAMUEL exit a large building on the docks

SAMUEL
You okay?

SAM
Yeah.

SAMUEL
How's the arm?

SAM
It'll hold till we get out of town.

SAMUEL
Just don't bleed out, all right?

SAM
Yeah, well, that's the plan.

SAM and SAMUEL are in a van.

Lights appear behind them.

SAMUEL
Cop.

DEPUTY ATKINS approaches the van.

SAMUEL
Evening, Deputy.

DEPUTY ATKINS
Agent Roark, Agent Wynand, mind stepping out of the van a moment?

SAM and SAMUEL exit the van.

SAMUEL
We're just on our way to the office. Everything okay?

DEPUTY ATKINS
No. I can't get Sheriff Dobbs on the phone. I can't get anyone!

SAMUEL
We spoke to Dobbs earlier. Maybe he's just, uh—

DEPUTY ATKINS
(noticing Sam's bloody sleeve) is that blood?

SAMUEL
Hey, look, there's no need to get riled.

DEPUTY ATKINS
You're coming with me.

SAMUEL
All right. We'll follow you back.

DEPUTY ATKINS
I don't think so. Get in my car, or you're under arrest.

SAM
You're gonna arrest two federal agents? Really? (laughs) Have a good night. (Sam turns away)

DEPUTY ATKINS
If you think—

SAMUEL
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, just hold—

(SAM beats DEPUTY ATKINS bloody, until he is unconscious)

SAMUEL
You think there were maybe calmer ways we could have done all that?

SAM
Do we care? Let's go.

ACT ONE
MOTEL ROOM
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

(Sam is listening to the television news program intently)

TV
Sources said prosecutors were getting closer to a decision on whether to charge the actor. But they adamantly denied that any prosecution was in any...

DEAN
What are you watching?

SAM
Just trying to catch up. So...Mel Gibson really took a turn this past year, huh?

DEAN
Or he's possessed. Seriously, think about it. So, I just got off the blower with Bobby.

SAM
Oh, yeah? You got anything else on this, uh, 'Mother of All' thing?

DEAN
Uh, no, nothing solid. He says it's quiet.

(Sam's cell phone dings, announcing a new text)

SAM
Quiet like quiet or quiet like too quiet?

DEAN
When is it ever just quiet?

SAM
Right. (Sam checks his cell phone and sees he has received a text message of coordinates) Hmm.

DEAN
What? What are these, coordinates? Who's it from?

SAM
I have no idea. (Sam looks the coordinates up on a map)

DEAN
Well?

SAM
Uh, Bristol, Rhode Island, where three women disappeared in the last week. Apparently, the, uh, victims seemed to vanish into thin air.

DEAN
Could be something. Who's the text from?

SAM
I don't know. It just kept ringing.

DEAN
What's that about?

SAM
Could be another hunter looking for backup, throwing us a case? Who knows how many hunters I even met, working with the Campbells, you know? But I think we should go.

DEAN
Whoa, wait. We're just gonna drop everything?

SAM
Dude, two minutes ago, you weren't doing anything.

DEAN
You got mysterious coordinates from a mysterious Mr. "X," leading to a mysterious town? That doesn't throw up red flags to you?

SAM
I don't know. Maybe. But that doesn't mean we can just ignore a bunch of missing girls. Right?

DEAN
Okay. We'll check it out. But if things get squirrelly, we dump out, okay?

SAM
Yeah.

DRIVING
INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

(Sam and Dean drive by a sign welcoming them to Bristol, Sam flashes back briefly to when he was last there)

DEAN
What?

SAM
Nothing.

RESTAURANT
INT. RESTAURANT – DAY

DEAN
(looking through missing persons leaflets) Well, freak's got a type—brunettes. Whoa. This one's got a little bit of a wild side. It's all in the eyes, Sam. See it?

SAM
All right, well, aside from your little deep insight there, these women actually have nothing in common—different jobs, different friends, different everything. So, what's the connection?

DEAN
I don't know. Why don't you figure that out? I'm gonna go hit the poop deck. (Dean heads to the bathroom, marked with the sign 'poop deck')

WOMAN
(approaches Sam)Agent Roark? It's good to see you again.

SAM
It is.

WOMAN
Oh, you remember my husband? (gestures to her husband)

SAM
Right.

WOMAN
Don.

SAM
Of course, right. Um, hi.

WOMAN
So, you're back 'cause it started again, right—the disappearances?

SAM
Uh, yeah. Yeah, right. Um...So, if either of you two hear anything, please let me know.

WOMAN
Where's your partner? The big bald guy? Agent Wynand, right?

SAM
Agent Wynand, of course. Well—

DEAN
Sex rehab. Yeah, you've heard of plushies, right?

SAM This is, uh—this is my new partner.

DEAN
Hi. Pleasure.(shakes woman's hand) How you doing? Hi.(shakes Don's hand) Uh, so, Agent, we should, uh—

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

WOMAN
Of course. Uh, nice chatting with you, Agent Roark.

SAM
You too.

(Woman touches Sam's shoulder, and he flashes back to when they last met. It seems they had sex in a bathroom)

WOMAN
(in Sam's memory) Cuff me.

DEAN
What was that? She just cougar-eyed you.

SAM
I think Samuel and I have worked a case in this town.

DEAN
You think? (Dean shows Sam a polaroid he got from the wall of customers who won the restaurant's eating challenge, which shows Sam and Samuel in the background, behind a winner) Come on. Let's get the hell out of here.

ABANDONED HOUSE
INT. ABANDONED HOUSE – DAY

DEAN
Hey, come on. Hop to, would you?

SAM
We can't go, Dean.

DEAN
Uh, yeah, we can.

SAM
No, listen—five guys went missing a year ago. They never found the bodies. I mean, that's got to be the job me and Samuel worked, right?

DEAN
Great. What difference does it make?

SAM
A year ago, five guys go missing, and—and now suddenly all these women go missing. Something's here. So either we just didn't stop it, or we only thought we did.

DEAN
Okay, but why the gender bend, huh? First it's dudes. Now it's chicks? That's a totally different M.O.

SAM
I don't know. Who knows? The point is, something's still here.

DEAN
Great. We'll call Bobby. He can deal with it.

SAM
Why? We can deal with it.

DEAN
Are you serious? Sam, there is a reason that hunters don't hit the same town over again—'cause we have a habit of leaving messes behind.

SAM
Right. I agree.

DEAN
One of dad's rules -- you never use the same crapper twice.

SAM
Everyone uses the same crapper twice.

DEAN
Not us. You know what I mean.

SAM
Okay, look—this creature is still walking around 'cause of me, right? I mean, I let it go. Dad also said, "you finish what you start." Okay, I get it.

DEAN
Do you?

SAM
Yes. You're afraid I'll stroll down memory lane and I'll kick this wall in my head so hard, Hell comes flooding through, right? And then all of a sudden, I'm some drooling mess on the floor.

DEAN
It's not a joke.

SAM
Okay. I know. But listen—what's happening here right now—it's because I messed up somehow, in some big way. So every person who gets taken, every person who dies—that's on me. I have to stop it. And you'd do the same thing.

DEAN
All right. I'll follow up with the brunettes. You see what you get from the cops.

INT. NICOLE'S HOUSE

DEAN So, you and Nicole were roommates for a long time.

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE Since college, but we've been best friends forever.

DEAN Hmm.

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE This whole thing's really surreal. Are you any closer to finding her, or...?

DEAN We're doing everything we can. Now, you were with Nicole the night she went missing. Did she say anything?

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE Nothing. It's like I told the cops -- I wish there was something.

DEAN (finds a business card from "Agent H. Roark" ) Where'd you get this?

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE Oh, Nicole got that from that FBI guy.

DEAN Agent Roark. About -- about yea high? (Dean puts his hand up and gestures about a foot above his head)

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE Yeah, that was him. One of the men that disappeared last year lived in our building.

DEAN Right.

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE So Agent Roark was asking us all questions about it, I guess.

DEAN You guess? So he -- he came by here?

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE Oh, he came -- by a few times.

DEAN Did he? To, uh...Speak to Nicole.

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE Right.

DEAN And how would you...Characterize their relationship?

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE Relationship? No, they weren't having a --

DEAN just the -- the -- the tone or the nature of their conversation.

NICOLE'S ROOMMATE Well...Loud. And...Athletic.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

(Sam is walking toward the entrance of the building, when he is spotted by Sheriff Atkins)

SHERIFF ATKINS (aiming gun at Sam) Hold it right there! Stop right there! Hands where I can see them!

(Sam has flashback to when he last encountered Sheriff Atkins)

SHERIFF ATKINS Get in my car, or you're under arrest.

SAM Look -- no, sir. Please just hold on for a second. There's been a misunderstanding here.

(Sheriff Atkins locks Sam in a cell)

SHERIFF ATKINS Man, you are dumb as a sack of hair --coming back here after what you did?

SAM Look, there's been a misunderstanding here.

SHERIFF ATKINS You are not a damn Agent, okay? The FBI never heard of you.

SAM Just listen.

SHERIFF ATKINS Where are the bodies? Mothers want to bury their loved ones.

SAM I don't know.

SHERIFF ATKINS Where's Sheriff Dobbs?

SAM I don't know.

SHERIFF ATKINS You run out of town soaked in blood --Oh, and you bash my brains in to do it -- and you really expect me to buy that?

SAM Look, would you believe that I don't remember anything?

SHERIFF ATKINS No. But good luck selling it to the judge.

(later that night Brenna Dobbs approaches Sam's cell)

BRENNA What happened to my husband?

SAM I-I don't know.

BRENNA Don't lie to me. I know who you are, Sam. I know what you do.

SAM What? You do?

(Sam remembers talking to Sheriff Ray Dobbs and Brenna, his wife lat time he was in town with Samuel)

SHERIFF ROY DOBBS Let me get this straight -- you're not feds. You actually hunt things.

SAMUEL We know how it sounds.

SHERIFF ROY DOBBS I'm not sure you do.

SAM You saw those crime scenes, Roy. You really think something human could have taken those guys?

BRENNA What you're saying -- it's impossible.

SAM You know, I'm sorry, I-I don't understand what she's got to do with any of this.

SHERIFF ROY DOBBS She's my wife. She works with me at the sheriff's station. You tell something like this to me, you tell it to her, too. All right, what do you need us to do?

(back to present day)

SAM Your husband -- he's the sheriff.

BRENNA Was the sheriff, until he vanished... And you vanished. What was I supposed to think? T-that thing got him, or that you killed him? I just want to know what happened.

SAM So do I. Believe me. Something happened to me. I have no memory of being here, ever.

BRENNA What is this, "Days of Our Lives"? You're telling me you have some sort of amnesia?

SAM If I knew any of this, would I have stepped foot into this station? I'm sorry. I-I don't even know your name.

BRENNA If this is some sort of a game, you're either incredibly clever or incredibly stupid.

SAM I'm telling the truth. Look... I don't know what happened to your husband. But I can find out.

BRENNA How?

SAM If you really know me, then you know that's my job.

BRENNA You really don't remember?

SAM No. I really don't.

BRENNA I'm Brenna Dobbs.

SAM Brenna...I'm sorry about what happened to your husband. But I can find answers...Just not from in here.

BRENNA (unlocks the cell door and releases Sam) Come on. Help me find some rope. If it's gonna look like a break-out, you're gonna need to tie me up.

INT. DON'S HOUSE

DEBBIE (looking at her husband, Don, while getting a glass of boxed wine from the fridge)What? The boxed stuff doesn't get better with age, Don. (she heads to the basement, and something from under the stairs grabs her) Ahh! Aah!


ACT 2
INT. ABANDONED HOUSE

(Sam hears someone approaching, draws his gun and waits by the door)

DEAN Hey, Sam. So, how does it feel to be a fugitive again? Hate to say "I told you so."

SAM You love to say "I told you so."

DEAN Actually, you're right -- I do love to say "I told you so." So, I found out something on, uh, "crazy eyes McGee." Turns out you two knew each other.

SAM What?

DEAN Biblically. I just spoke to her roommate. I got to say, man -- you really got around. I mean, soulless or not I'm actually kind of impressed.

POLICE SCANNER

Eight Sierra Papa. Got a 1057, 1100 block of Hope Street. Over.

SAM Missing person -- another one.

DEAN Okay, all right. I'll go. You stay.

SAM Yeah. Fine.

DEAN Sam?

SAM What?

DEAN Stay here.

SAM Fine! Go!

EXT. DON & DEBBIE'S HOUSE

DEAN Listen, thank you for your time. We're on it.

DON Yeah. Thanks.

(Dean calls Sam's phone and gets his voicemail)

SAM'S PHONE This is Sam. Leave a message.

DEAN Sam, answer the phone, damn it. I found the connection between the missing chicks. They all banged the same dude -- You. It's you, Sam. The texts, the victims, all of it -- it's a trap for you. Call me back.

INT. DOBBS' HOUSE

(Brenna finds Sam and is startled)

SAM I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

BRENNA You can't be here!

SAM Okay, p-please just listen.

BRENNA What happened to Debbie Harris?

SAM Debbie?

BRENNA I let you out, and she's just gone.

SAM And y-you think I did something to her?

BRENNA I don't know what to think.

SAM Look, um, I need your help.

BRENNA Are you kidding?

SAM I need the case files that your husband made about the disappearances last year.

BRENNA So go to the station and find it.

SAM It's not there. I broke in and I looked, and it's gone. And I have a theory about who might have it. Look, we both want the same thing here, Brenna. I promise. We want to find out what happened last year, and we want to stop what's happening right now.

BRENNA The file's upstairs. I'll be right back.

(Sam has a brief flash of Samuel)

SAMUEL Let's go!

(Sam remembers the last time he was in Brenna's house with Samuel)

BRENNA So, you guys just travel all the time? I mean, you just pick up and go? Doesn't that get hard?

SAMUEL Not when you're young -- it's great. Once you got a family, it's a little tougher. Deanna got pregnant, and we didn't know what we were gonna do. But Mary was...She was a blessing. (Samuel notices his beer is empty)

ROY There's more in the garage.

SAMUEL Ah, listen, you sit. I'll get it.

BRENNA (to Sam) He misses her. You know, at least you two have each other.

SAM Well, Samuel wasn't really around when I was a kid. We have more of a, uh, business relationship.

BRENNA Uh, do you have any other family?

SAM Family just slows you down.

(present time)

BRENNA Sam? Sam?! You all right?

SAM Yeah. Yeah. Um...All right, let's see what you have.

(They start going through the case file, Sam remembers more)

INT. RESTAURANT

SAMUEL Best guess --it came from an Arachne.

SAM You ever seen one?

SAMUEL No one has -- not outside of Crete, not for about 2,000 years.

SAM Then what do we even know about them?

SAMUEL Zip. Just a bunch of guesses and a blurry picture on the side of a Greek vase.

RESTAURANT PATRON Yeah!

WAITRESSES Yo ho sea captain! (they place a pirate hat on patron's head, and snap a polaroid)

SAM So, I gather we got no clue how to kill this thing, huh?

SAMUEL I guess we just go at it till something sticks.

SAM Well, I got an idea of where it might be, at least. So far, all the vics have been men in their 30s, and they've all gone missing within a 2-mile radius.

SAMUEL So we just get out and kick bushes.

SAM No, that'd be a waste of time. I mean, it's all suburban sprawl -- hundreds of houses, at least. It could be anywhere.

SAMUEL (looking at where Sam is pointing on the map)Lonely Pines Park.

SAM Yeah. I say we make this thing come to us.

SAMUEL How do we do that?

(present time)

SAM Hey, um, Brenna, do you mind if I -- if I, um, borrow all this stuff for a couple hours?

BRENNA Um, okay, I guess. You really don't remember Roy, do you? He was a good man. I've made peace that he's dead. I have. But I just want to know what happened.

SAM I'm sure he died a hero.

(Sam exits the house and checks his voicemail)

SAM'S VOICEMAIL DEAN Sam, answer the phone,damn it. I found the connection between the missing chicks. They all banged the same dude --You. It's you, Sam. The texts, the victims, all of it -- it's a trap for you. Call me back.

(Sam, transfixed by a spiderweb, is surprised when he is tapped on the shoulder and levels his gun)

DEAN Whoa. Whoa.

SAM I almost shot you...Again. What the hell?

DEAN I figured you'd come and talk to her. I told you to stay home, man. Did you get my message? Come on. We got to get you out of here. Let's go.

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE

DEAN Well we know that this is a monster with opposable thumbs and unlimited text messaging, and we know that it wants to kill you specifically. Does that about cover it?

SAM It's an Arachne.

DEAN A what?

SAM I remembered.

DEAN You remembered? Y-- I'm sorry. Uh, what else have you remembered?

SAM Don't worry, all right? I-it's nothing to do with Hell.

DEAN Uh-huh. Not yet, anyway.

SAM What can I do, Dean? The stuff is just starting to come back, all right? Maybe it's natural.

DEAN We're leaving.

SAM No, we can't.

DEAN We are not the only hunters on the planet, okay? We can call Bobby. He and Rufus could come and wrap up.

SAM How? Like you said, it could be anybody, we got jack for leads.

DEAN We know that it hates you.

SAM I know who did this. I just -- I can't remember.

DEAN I don't think you get the risk here, Sam.

SAM Yes, I do.

DEAN Really? You get that every time you scratch that wall, that you are playing Russian roulette?

SAM Dean, I get you're worried, okay? And I know what you think is gonna happen. But you know what? It will or it won't.

DEAN Sam --

SAM --look, I'm starting to think that -- that I might have done some bad stuff here, Dean. And so I don't care if it's dangerous. I have to set things right, 'cause I got a frigging soul now, and -- and it won't let me just walk away. I'm staying here. And I need you to back me up.

DEAN All right. Why not? Well, let's "memento" this thing, shall we?

(they pin all the evidence they have up on the wall)

(Sam's memories flash by)

DEBBIE So, you're back 'cause it started again, right -- the disappearances?

ROY You're not feds. You actually hunt things.

BRENNA You really don't remember?

DEAN I, uh, found something on "crazy eyes McGee." Turns out you two knew each other.

DEAN You okay?

(Sam remembers)

INT. RESTAURANT

SAM (on the phone)That's right. Yeah, Lonely Pines Park,one hour. Thanks, Roy. All right.

SAMUEL Are you sure about this?

SAM The Arachne's been snacking on mid-30s guys. We need bait that fits the demo. I'm too young. You're too old.

SAMUEL 89 and counting. I still think that we should have looped Roy in on the plan.

SAM Do we want a credible performance, or don't we?

SAMUEL But what if something goes wrong?

SAM Roy's a big boy. He'll be fine.Trust me.

SAMUEL It's just... not the way I'm used to doing things.

SAM Got it. Welcome to the future. Let's go.

EXT. PARK

SAM Let's hope this thing's hungry.

ROY (attacked be arachne) Ugh! Aah!

SAMUEL Let's split up, look for him.

SAM No, no, wait. It's too late.

SAMUEL Let's go!

SAM They're gone, Samuel! Look -- it's okay. I turned on the G.P.S. on Roy's cell.

SAMUEL In English, please.

SAM We can track them back to wherever she goes.

SAMUEL So, what, Roy's just some redshirt to you, just spider bait?

SAM No, no, of course not. This is my back-up plan.

SAMUEL My God, son, you're about as cold as they come. You know that?

SAM Let's go.

(Sam and Samuel follow the GPS back to where the Arachne is hiding - a large building by the docks, they find several men trapped in spider-webbing)

SAMUEL (cutting through the webbing to reveal a man with glasses)Poor bastard.

(the web-trapped man gasps for air, and the other trapped victims do as well, they are all still alive)

ROY Help me. I can't...Feel...

SAM Roy, hey, where is she? (Sam is thrown back by Arachne)

ARACHNE (Sam from where he has fallen on the floor, kicks the arachne, and she staggers back)Ugh!

(Samuel shoots the arachne, and she throws him across the room, Sam slices off Arachne's head with a machete)

SAMUEL Well, I guess decapitation works. Roy. You're gonna be okay. Just hang in. We're gonna get you some help. Listen, if we can get him to the hospital quick --

SAM He can't be helped.

SAMUEL What?

SAM I don't know about Arachne, but I do know about spiders. One brown recluse bite can kill you. This thing? Look at these guys -- that poison's eating them alive. They're just dead men walking.

SAMUEL So, what are you saying?

SAM I'm saying we put him out of his misery.(Sam draws his gun)

ROY Sam...Please.

SAM Killing this thing saved a lot of lives. We couldn't have done it without you.

ROY No.

SAM You're a hero. (Sam shoots Roy in the head, and continues to execute all the other victims) We can't just leave the bodies here. Get the gasoline.

(back to current time)

SAM I know what happened.

INT. BRENNA'S HOUSE

(Roy enters, but he looks like the Arachne)

BRENNA Roy?

ROY I love you.

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE

DEAN What are you gonna say to Brenna?

SAM (on the phone)Relax, Dean. Hey, Brenna, it's -- it's Sam. I'm just checking in. Yeah, of course I can swing by. Okay. Yeah. Bye.

DEAN What was that about?

SAM She wants me to swing by.

DEAN For?

SAM She said it's no big deal, but I can tell she's in deep trouble.

EXT. BRENNA'S HOUSE

SAM Dean, back door.

DEAN Sam. Light's on in the shed. My spidey senses are tingling.

SAM Shh.

BRENNA Sam?

SAM Brenna? Hey.

BRENNA What you did to Roy...Is it true?

(Roy attacks Dean, then Sam and grabs Sam by the throat)

ROY Answer the question, Sam.

ACT 3
(Roy has trapped Sam and Dean in webbing)

ROY You got to admit I look good, Sam. Well, except for your little souvenir. (Roy points to his forehead and the bullet sized scar there)

SAM You win. I'm here. Let Brenna go. This has nothing to do with her.

ROY You come back around, start hanging out with my wife, and you think this has nothing to do with her? But then...you thought I was out of the way, right? I got to say, you get a hell of a lot wrong, Sam, like that thing you threw me to. You thought it was here to feed.

SAM She was here to breed.

ROY Yeah. That thing was playing the mating game, and I guess I fit her profile...Me and all those other poor bastards. She bit us to turn us into what she was. By the time you pulled that trigger, I wasn't human. Not anymore. So bullets didn't hurt me much. Oh, and neither did fire. So after you left, well, we ran. Me -- I hid for months, nearly starved. But you know what kept me going? Every night, I dreamed about ripping your throat out. I thought I was sending you a neon sign. The text? Taking all those girls you screwed? I was kicking so much sand in your eye, I couldn't figure out why you weren't getting it! Then Bren tells me you've got brain damage. It's just too good.

SAM Where are they, Roy...the women?

ROY Scattered...In the wind. They're like me now. You killed one monster, you made so many more. Congratulations. The only question is, do I kill you...Or turn you?

(Dean cuts himself free with a glass shard, and attacks Roy)

DEAN Ugh!

(Roy throws Dean, and picks him up by the throat)

BRENNA No! Roy, stop!

( Brenna frees Sam and Sam decapitates Roy)


FINAL ACT
EXT. DOBBS'S HOUSE

SAM Brenna...Look, I am so sorry. Brenna, I-I mean, I...

(Brenna closes her door without ever turning to look at Sam)

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE

DEAN You okay?

SAM You were right. We shouldn't have come back here.

DEAN Well, you did kill uh...spider man.

SAM So, you're suggesting what I did back there was a good thing?

DEAN I'm just saying --

SAM What?

DEAN Sam, y-y-you got to understand that all that crap last year -- all of it -- none of it was you.

SAM Let's be crystal clear, okay? It was me.

DEAN Well, can I get you anything?

SAM What are you now, my waitress?

DEAN I'm just trying to make you feel better. Don't be a bitch.

SAM Yeah, I'm fine.

DEAN Yeah, you look fine. All I'm saying is everything's gonna be okay.

SAM I don't know, Dean. If I did this here, then who knows how many oth--

(there is an audible thud as Sam drops to the floor)

DEAN Sammy? Sammy?! (Dean runs over to Sam whose eyes are open, but unseeing) Sammy, talk to me!

(in his mind's eye, Sam remembers the Cage, remembers burning, and screams)
