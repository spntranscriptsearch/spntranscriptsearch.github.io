TEASER
ROOSEVELT ASYLUM. ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS.

INTERIOR.

A deserted building. Graffiti and rubbish everywhere. Torch light moves along the walls, a chain across a door is broken.

EXTERIOR.

A police car pulls up. Two cops walk up to chain link fence surrounding the building.

COP 1
Can't keep kids out of this place.

COP 2
What is it, anyway?

COP 1
I forgot! You're not a local. You don't know the legend.

COP 2
Legend?

COP 1
Every town's got it's stories, right? Ours is Roosevelt Asylum. They say it's haunted with the ghosts of the patients. Spend the night, the spirits will drive you insane.

INTERIOR

Cops enter with flashlights.

COP 1
Hello? Police Officers...Po-lice Officers!

They see the broken chain on the floor.

COP 1
You telling me these kids brought bolt-cutters? C'mon. Let's split up.

COP 2
Right.

.........................

COP 2
(now alone) Hello? Hello?

........................

Camera switches between cops wandering about alone.

COP 1
(wanders into another room. Expression changes) Alright, c'mon out.

Flashlight reveals three kids sitting in the dark.

.......................

COP 2’s flashlight goes out and he shakes it.

A door creaks open, POV from the doorway, looking at cop. He slowly turns to look at the door.

.....................

EXTERIOR

COP 1 watches a car drive off then reaches for his radio.

COP 1
Kelly, you copy?

COP 2 appears suddenly behind him.

Cop 1
(jumping) Jeez! Where the hell you been?

COP 2
In there...

COP 1
What was it? See anything?

COP 2
Huh. No.

They return to the police car.

COP 1
(into car radio) This is patrol one four. We are clear and returning to station.

VOICE ON RADIO
Roger.

COP 2’s nose starts to bleed. He wipes it slowly.

.........................

INTERIOR

COP 2 enters bedroom. A woman is reading in bed.

WOMAN
Hey.

COP 2 begins lining up gun, keys, etc, on a chest of drawers.

WOMAN
So, what? You're still not talking to me? Walt! I said I was sorry about before – how many times do I have to say it?

COP 2 picks up gun.

........................

EXTERIOR – VIEW OF WINDOW

Sounds of gunshot. A brief pause, then another gunshot.


ACT ONE
INTERIOR MOTEL ROOM

SAM
(on phone) No, Dad was in California last we heard from him. We just thought...he comes to you for 'munitions....maybe you've seen him in the last few weeks. Just, call us if you hear anything.

VOICE ON PHONE
’kay.

SAM
Thanks.

VOICE
You bet.

DEAN
Caleb hasn't heard from him?

SAM
Nope. And neither has Jefferson or Pastor Jim. What about the journal? Anything leads in there?

DEAN
No, same as last time I looked. Nothing I can make out.... I love the guy, but I swear, he writes like friggin' Yoda.

SAM
You know, maybe we should call the Feds. File a missing person’s.

DEAN
We've talked about this. Dad'd be pissed if we put the Feds on his tail.

SAM
I don't care anymore.

Cellphone rings. DEAN crosses the room.

SAM
After all that happened back in Kansas, I mean...he should've been there, Dean. You said so yourself. You tried to call him and...nothing.

DEAN
I know! (He rummages through his duffel) Where the hell is my cellphone?

SAM
You know, he could be dead for all we know.

DEAN
Don't say that! He's not dead! He's – he's...

SAM
He's what? He's hiding? He's busy?

DEAN finds and flicks opens the cellphone.

DEAN
(quietly) Huh. I don't believe it.

SAM
What?

DEAN
It's, uh....It's a text message. It's coordinates.

.............................

DEAN typing on laptop.

SAM
You think Dad was texting us?

DEAN
He's given us coordinates before.

SAM
The man can barely work a toaster, Dean.

DEAN
Sam, it's good news! It means he's okay, or alive at least.

SAM
Well, was there a number on the caller ID?

DEAN
Nah, it said 'unknown'.

SAM
Well, where do the coordinates point?

DEAN
That's the interesting part. Rockford, Illinois.

SAM
Ok, and that's interesting how?

DEAN
I checked the local Rockford paper. Take a look at this.

DEAN
This cop, Walter Kelly, comes home from his shift, shoots his wife, then puts the gun in his mouth, blows his brains out. And earlier that night, Kelly and his partner responded to a call at the Roosevelt Asylum.

SAM
Okay, I'm not following. What has this have to do with us?

DEAN
Dad earmarked the same asylum in the journal. Let’s see...

DEAN
Here. Seven unconfirmed sightings, two deaths – till last week at least. I think this is where he wants us to go.

SAM
(snorts) This is a job... Dad wants us to work a job.

DEAN
Well, maybe we'll meet up with him? Maybe he's there?

SAM
Maybe he's not? I mean, he could be sending us there, by ourselves, to hunt this thing.

DEAN
Who cares! If he wants us there, it's good enough for me!

SAM
This doesn't strike you as weird? The texting? The coordinates?

DEAN
Sam! Dad's tellin' us to go somewhere, we're goin'.

SAM makes a bitchface and sighs.

.....................

Cruising Impala shot.

......................

INTERIOR. BAR

COP 1 sits at the bar.

DEAN
You're Daniel Gunderson. You're a cop, right?

GUNDERSON
Yeah.

DEAN
Huh. I'm uh, Nigel Tufnel, The Chicago Tribune. Mind if I ask you a couple of questions, about your partner?

GUNDERSON
Yeah, I do. I'm just tryin' to have a beer here.

DEAN
That's okay, I swear it won't take that long. I just want to get the story in your words.

GUNDERSON
A week ago, my partner was sitting in that chair. Now he's dead. You gonna ambush me here?

DEAN
Sorry. But I need to know what happened.

SAM pushes DEAN aside roughly.

SAM
Hey buddy, why don't you leave the poor guy alone! The man's an officer! Why dontcha show a little respect!

DEAN pauses, staring, then walks off.

GUNDERSON
You didn't havta do that.

SAM
Yeah, course I did. That guy's a serious jerk. Let me buy you a beer, huh? (looks at barman) Two?

GUNDERSON
Thanks.

–

SAM walks out of the bar.

DEAN
(sitting on Impala) Shoved me kinda hard in there, buddy boy.

SAM
I had to sell it, didn't I? It's method acting.

DEAN
Huh?

SAM
Never mind.

DEAN
What'd you find out from Gunderson?

SAM
So, Walter Kelly was a good cop. Head of his class, even-keeled, he had a bright future ahead of him.

DEAN
What about at home?

SAM
He and his wife had a few fights, like everybody, but he was mostly smooth sailing. They were even talking about having kids.

DEAN
Alright, so either Kelly had some deep-seated crazy waiting to bust out, or something else did it to him.

SAM
Right.

DEAN
What'd Gunderson tell you about the asylum?

SAM
A lot.

...............................

EXTERIOR

SAM and DEAN jump over the tall chain linked fence at the asylum and enter.

...............................

INTERIOR

SAM
So apparently the cops chased the kids here....into the south wing. (SAM indicates a sign over one door.)

DEAN
South wing, huh? Wait a second (He flips through John's journal.) 1972. Three kids broke into the south wing, only one survived. Way he tells it, one of his friends went nuts and started lighting up the place.

SAM
So whatever's going on, the south wing is the heart of it.

DEAN
But if the kids are spelunking the asylum, why aren't there a ton more deaths?

SAM
(looking around. He notes the broken chain). Looks like the doors are usually chained. Could've been chained up for years.

DEAN
Yeah, to keep people out. Or to keep something in.

They look at each other, then SAM slowly pushes the door open.

.......................

SAM and DEAN walk down a hallway.

DEAN
Let me know if you see any dead people, Haley Joel.

SAM
Dude, enough.

DEAN
I'm serious. You gotta be careful, all right? Ghosts are attracted to that whole ESP thing you got going on.

SAM
I told you, it's not ESP! I just have strange vibes sometimes. Weird dreams.

DEAN
Yeah, whatever. Don't ask, don't tell.

SAM
You get any reading on that thing or not?

DEAN
Nope. Of course, it doesn't mean no one's home.

SAM
Spirits can't appear during certain hours of the day.

DEAN
Yeah, the freaks come out at night.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
(deadpan) Hey Sam, who do you think is the hotter psychic: Patricia Arquette, Jennifer Love Hewitt, or you?

SAM pushes DEAN, who laughs.

......................

INTERIOR. Another room. The boys look around.

DEAN
(whistles) Man. Electro-shock. Lobotomies. They did some twisted stuff to these people. Kinda like my man Jack in Cuckoo's Nest. (makes crazy eyes and grins at SAM)

SAM ignores him and DEAN's smile drops. They look around some more.

DEAN
So. Whaddaya think? Ghosts possessing people?

SAM
Maybe. Or maybe it's more like Amityville, or the Smurl hunting.

DEAN
Spirits driving them insane. Kinda like my man Jack in The Shining. (grins)

SAM
Dean. (DEAN looks at him) When are we going to talk about it?

DEAN
Talk about what?

SAM
About the fact Dad's not here.

DEAN
Oh. I see. How ’bout...never.

SAM
I'm being serious, man. He sent us here...

DEAN
So am I, Sam. Look, he sent us here, he obviously wants us here. We'll pick up the search later.

SAM
It doesn't matter what he wants.

DEAN
See. That attitude? Right there? That is why I always get the extra cookie.

SAM
Dad could be in trouble, we should be looking for him. We deserve some answers, Dean. I mean, this is our family we're talking about.

DEAN
I understand that, Sam, but he's given us an order.

SAM
So what, we gotta always follow Dad's orders?

DEAN
Of course we do.

SAM gives DEAN a frustrated face. DEAN stares at him then turns away, ending the conversation.

DEAN
(poking around and picking up a sign) 'Sanford Ellicott'...You know what we gotta do. We gotta find out more about the south wing. See if something happened here.

DEAN walks away, leaving the sign with SAM, who stares down at it with a bitchface.

..........................

INTERIOR. A WAITING ROOM.

SAM sits on couch flicking through a magazine. A man comes to the open door. The sign on the door reads 'Dr James Ellicott, Clinical Psychiatry'.

ELLICOTT
Sam Winchester?

SAM
That's me.

ELLICOTT
Come on in.

They move into the inner room.

SAM
Thanks again for seeing me last minute.

SAM
(looking around the room). Dr...Ellicott. Ellicott, that name. Wasn’t there a...a Dr. Sanford Ellicott? Yeah, he was a chief psychiatrist somewhere.

ELLICOTT
My father was chief of staff at the old Roosevelt Asylum. How did you know?

SAM
Ah. Well, I'm sorta...a local history buff. Hey, wasn't there, an incident or something? In the hospital, I guess. In the south wing, right?

ELLICOTT
We're on your dollar, Sam. We're here to talk about you.

SAM
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Sure.

ELLICOTT
So. How's things?

SAM
Ah, things are good, doctor.

ELLICOTT
Good. Whatcha been doing?

SAM
Ahh, same old. I just been on a... on a road trip with my brother.

ELLICOTT
Was that fun?

SAM
(long pause) Loads. Umm. You know, we...ahh...we...met...a lot of ...interesting people. Did a lot of ...ah...interesting things...ahhh. You know? What was it exactly that happened in the south wing? I forget...

ELLICOTT
Look, if you're a local history buff, you know all about the Roosevelt riot.

SAM
The riot. Well, no. I know. I'm just curious.

ELLICOTT
Sam. Let's cut the bull, shall we. You're avoiding the subject.

SAM
What subject?

ELLICOTT
You. Now I'll make you a deal. I'll tell you all about the Roosevelt riot, if you tell me something honest about yourself. Like, uh, this brother you're road tripping with. How do you feel about him?

SAM looks a little freaked out.
.....................

EXTERIOR.

DEAN leans against glass windows next to the door, looking bored.

SAM walks past. DEAN catches up and matches his pace.

DEAN
Dude! You were in there forever. What the hell were you talking about?

SAM
Just the hospital, you know.

DEAN
And...?

SAM
And the south wing? It's where the housed the really hard cases. The psychotics, the criminally insane.

DEAN
Sounds cozy.

SAM
Yeah. And one night in '64, they rioted. Attacked staff. Attacked each other.

DEAN
So the patients took over the asylum?

SAM
Apparently.

DEAN
Any deaths?

SAM
Some patients, some staff. I guess it was pretty gory. Some of the bodies were never even recovered, including our chief of staff, Ellicott.

DEAN
Whaddaya mean, never recovered?

SAM
Cops scoured every inch of the place but I guess the patients must've...stuffed the bodies somewhere hidden.

DEAN
That's grim.

SAM
Yeah. So, they transfered all the remaining patients and closed the hospital down.

DEAN
So, to sum it up, we've got a bunch of violent deaths and a bunch of unrecovered bodies.

SAM
And a bunch of angry spirits.

DEAN
Good times. Let's check out the hospital tonight.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
INTERIOR. ASYLUM

Torchlight approaches behind a door. Heads are seen. The door creaks open. A young man and woman, university aged, enter.

GUY
Check this out! Creepy...yet terrifying.

GIRL
I thought we were going to a movie.

GUY
This is better. It's like we're in a movie.

GIRL
(huffing) I can't believe you call this a date.

GUY
C'mon, it'll be fun. Let's look around. C'mon!

They move further along.

GUY
(jumping and swinging around) What's that?

Girl swings around. Guy pokes her and she jumps, then hits him. He laughs.

GUY
Hey look. C'mon, let's check it out.

GIRL
I...don't want to. Let's just go.

GUY
C'mon!

They stare at each other.

GUY
Okay. Okay, you can wait here.

GIRL
W– Gavin. No.

GAVIN
I'm just gonna be a minute. Nothing's gonna get ya, I promise.

GAVIN moves into the next room alone. The door slams behind him. He looks at it, grins, and keeps going. In the doorway a female figure with long hair is seen in shadow just as GAVIN's flashlight fails. He shakes it.

GAVIN
Damn it.

GAVIN
(He turns around) Hey, Sweetie. Couldn't take it, huh?

FEMALE
(coming closer and putting her hands either side of his face) Hey.

They start making out.

GIRL
(calling in the distance) Gavin? Gavin, where are you??

Gavin pulls back and freaks out.

................

INTERIOR. ASYLUM

Back at the entrance. SAM pushes open the door, DEAN beside him.

SAM is holding a video camera and flashlight, DEAN an EMF meter.

SAM
Getting readings?

DEAN
Yeah, big time.

SAM
This place is orbing like crazy.

DEAN
Probably multiple spirits out and about.

SAM
And if these uncovered bodies are causing the haunting...

DEAN
We gotta find ’em and burn ’em. Just be careful though. The only thing that makes me more nervous than a pissed off spirit... is the pissed off spirit of a psycho killer.

They keep walking. The camera pans across to see a crazed-looking bald man strapped into a straitjacket in the corner.

.............................


SAM and DEAN keep looking and move into separate rooms. After a minute SAM sees an old woman through the video lens; white haired, one eye bloody and hanging out, moving toward him.

SAM
Dean? Dean!! (DEAN runs into the room, rummaging in his bag at the same time) Shotgun!

DEAN
(shouting) Sam, get down!

SAM throws himself on the ground. DEAN shoots the woman. She disintegrates.

They both look around, gasping.

SAM
That was weird.

DEAN
Yeah. You're telling me.

DEAN starts moving out of the room. SAM follows.

SAM
No, Dean, I mean it was weird that she didn't attack me.

DEAN
Looked pretty aggro from where I was standing.

SAM
She didn't hurt me. She didn't even try! So if she didn't wanna hurt me then what did she want?

A noise comes from a room they are passing. DEAN immediately raises his shotgun and SAM flicks on the torch and shines it into the room. They approach a metal bed covered in a ragged sheet, on its side. They see the top of a blonde head behind it. They brace themselves. SAM reaches out and tips the bed over. The girl from earlier is crouched facing the corner. She spins around, terrified and gasping.

DEAN
It's alright, we're not going to hurt you. It's okay. What's your name?

GIRL
Katherine. Kat.

DEAN
Okay. I'm Dean, this is Sam.

SAM
What are you doing here!?

KAT
Um. My boyfriend, Gavin.

DEAN
Is he here?

KAT
Somewhere. He thought it would be fun, try and see some ghosts. I thought it was all just...you know. Pretend. I've seen things. I heard Gavin scream and...

DEAN
Alright. Kat? Come on. Sam's gunna get you out of here and then we're gunna find your boyfriend.

KAT
No! No. I'm not going to leave without Gavin. I'm coming with you.

DEAN
It's no joke around here, okay. It's dangerous.

KAT
That's why I gotta find him.

DEAN and SAM look at each other. SAM shrugs.

DEAN
Alright, I guess we gunna split up then. Let's go.

...............

SAM
(wandering around) Gavin.... Gavin?

.................

KAT
(with DEAN, viewed through a dirty window) Gavin... Gavin?

DEAN
I got a question for ya. You've seen a lot of horror movies, yeah?

KAT
I guess so.

DEAN
(turning to face her) Do me a favor. Next time you see one? Pay attention. When someone says a place is haunted...don't go in!

As they move on, a dark shape moves across the inside of the window.

..............

SAM
(sees Gavin on the ground unconscious and crouches to shake him. Gavin wakes and freaks out) Hey, Gavin. It's okay, I'm here to help.

GAVIN
Who are you?

SAM
My name is Sam. Uh, we found your girlfriend.

GAVIN
Kat? (getting up) Is she alright?

SAM
Yeah. She's worried about you. Are you okay?

GAVIN
I was running. I think I fell.

SAM
You were running from what?

GAVIN
There was...there was this girl. Her face. It was all messed up.

SAM
Okay listen, did this girl... did she try and hurt you?

GAVIN
What? No, she...uh...

SAM
She what?

GAVIN
She...kissed me.

SAM
Uh...um...but...but she didn't hurt you, physically?

GAVIN
Dude! She kissed me. I'm scarred for life!

SAM
Well, trust me, it could have been worse. Now do you remember anything else?

GAVIN
She uh...actually, she tried to whisper something in my ear.

SAM
What?

GAVIN
I don't know. I ran like hell.

................

DEAN and KAT in another hallway, DEAN leading the way. The flashlight fades.

DEAN
(shaking the flashlight) You son of a bitch. (reaching into his pocket) It's alright, I got a lighter.

KAT turns to look behind them.

KAT
Ow. You're hurting my arm.

DEAN
What are you talking about?

They turn to look at each other, realize they're too far apart to be touching, and look down. A disembodied hand is clutching KAT's arm.

KAT is dragged into a room, the metal door slamming behind her. DEAN races to it and struggles to pull it open, KAT bangs on it from the inside but it doesn't budge.

END ACT TWO .............................

ACT THREE
INTERIOR. ASYLUM

DEAN continues to struggle with the door.

KAT
Lemme out! Please!

DEAN
Kat! Hang on!

DEAN smashes at the door with a metal pipe, then tries to jimmy it open. Inside, KAT slowly backs up, looking at the door. Someone stands behind her, breathing heavily. When KAT spins around there is no one there. DEAN continues banging on the door. KAT turns again and sees the ghost. Tall, heavyset, long dark oily hair, his face a bloody mess. KAT screams and backs up to the door...and backs into him. She screams again.

SAM
(running down hall to DEAN, followed by GAVIN) What's going on?

DEAN
She's inside with one of them.

KAT
(screams) Help me!!

GAVIN
Kat!

KAT
(sliding down against the door as the ghost approaches) Get me outta here!

SAM
Kat, it's not going to hurt you. Listen to me. You've got to face it. You've got to calm down.

DEAN
(turning to SAM, astonished) She's gotta what?!

KAT
(shouting) I have to what?!

SAM
These spirits, they're not trying to hurt us, they're trying to communicate. You gotta face it. You gotta listen to it.

KAT
You face it!

SAM
No! It's the only way to get out of there.

KAT
No!

SAM
Look at it, come on. You can do it.

KAT, taking deep breaths, turns to face the ghost. He leans in close to her face.

GAVIN
Kat?

DEAN
Man, I hope you're right about this.

SAM
Yeah, me too.

They wait outside the door in tense silence. The lock clicks and the door slowly opens. KAT is standing in the doorway.

GAVIN
Oh, Kat.

SAM goes inside to check out the room. He comes back out, shaking his head at DEAN.

KAT
One thirty-seven.

DEAN
Sorry?

KAT
It whispered in my ear. 137.

SAM and DEAN
(in synch) Room number.

SAM and DEAN crouch against the wall where they can't be heard.

SAM
Alright. So if these spirits aren't trying to hurt anyone...

DEAN
Then what are they trying to do?

SAM
Maybe that's what they've been trying to tell us...

DEAN
I guess we'll find out.

SAM
Alright.

DEAN
So, now, are you guys ready to leave this place?

KAT
That's an understatement.

DEAN
Okay. (to SAM) You get them outta here. I'm going to go find room 137.

.........................

INTERIOR.

SAM leads KAT and GAVIN down a hallway.

KAT
So. How do you guys know about all this ghost stuff?

SAM
It's kinda our job.

KAT
Why would anyone want a job like that?

SAM
(huffs a laugh) I had a crappy guidance counselor.

KAT
And Dean? He's your boss?

SAM
(looking down at her) No.

..................

DEAN moves down a hallway and shines his torch on room 137. He pushes against the door, using his weight to push aside the broken furniture blocking it. The room is a mess, filing cabinets pushed over, papers everywhere, the walls stained. He shines the torch around, flicks through some folders lying in a cabinet, keeps looking.

.....................
SAM marches down a hallway and tries the door, but it's locked. He tries another one, also locked.

SAM
Alright. I think we have a small problem.

GAVIN
Then break it down.

SAM
I don't think that's gunna work.

GAVIN
Then a window.

KAT
They're barred.

GAVIN
Then how are we supposed to get out?

SAM
That's the point. We're not. There's something in here. It doesn't want us to leave.

KAT
Those patients...

SAM
No. Something else.

.....................

DEAN is still searching the room. He finds a loose panel and pries it off. Behind it is a satchel full of papers.

DEAN
This is why I get paid the big bucks.

Inside is a journal with many notes and hand-drawn pictures of medical instruments. DEAN pulls up a chair and starts reading, looking concerned.

DEAN
Well all work and no play makes Dr. Ellicott a very dull boy.

A noise makes him look up quickly.

..................

SAM
(moving back down a hallway toward KAT/GAVIN) Alright, I've looked everywhere. There's no other way out.

GAVIN
So what the hell are we gunna do?

SAM
Well for starters, we're not gunna panic.

GAVIN
Why the hell not!

SAM's phone rings and he answers.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN
(on a bad line) Sam, it's me. I see it. It's coming at me.

SAM
Where are you?

DEAN
I'm in the basement. Hurry up!

SAM
I'm on my way.

SAM hangs up and looks at KAT/GAVIN.

Alright, can either of you handle a shotgun?

GAVIN
What? No!

KAT
I can.

Gavin looks at her in amazement.

KAT
My dad took me skeet shooting a coupla times.

SAM
Alright, here. It's loaded with rock salt. It may not kill a spirit, but it will repel it. So if you see something, shoot.

KAT
Okay.

SAM
’kay.

...........................

SAM
(searching through hallways and rooms) Dean!

His flashlight flickers and fades. He shakes and taps it. A door behind him swings open. He raises his shot gun and approaches carefully.

SAM
Dean?

A shadow moves behind a ragged curtain, drawing his attention. When he pulls the curtain back there's no one there. He turns....and an old beaten up man with ragged hair and clothes grabs his face. His hands start glowing.

MAN
Don't be afraid. I'm going to make you all better.

END ACT THREE ...................................

ACT FOUR
INTERIOR.

GAVIN paces, KAT crouches against the wall holding the shotgun.

KAT
(sighing) Hey, Gavin?

GAVIN
(coming to crouch beside her) Yeah?

KAT
If we make it out of here alive...we are so breaking up.

GAVIN stares at her. They hear a noise around the corner and both rise.

KAT
(raising the shotgun) Did you hear that?

GAVIN
Something's coming.

DEAN comes around the corner and sees KAT just as she pulls the trigger. He throws himself back around the corner.

DEAN (crouching against the wall) Damn it, damn it, don't shoot! It's me!

KAT
Sorry! Sorry.

DEAN
Son of a ... (he comes round the corner and looks at the marks left in the wall) What are you still doing here!? Where's Sam?

GAVIN
He went to the basement. You called him.

DEAN
I didn't call anybody.

KAT
His cell phone rang. He said it was you.

DEAN
Basement, huh?

DEAN (looking around and grabbing some extra weapons) Alright. Watch yourselves....and watch out for me!

.......................

DEAN
(looking around in the basement) Sammy? Sam, you down here? Sam? Sam!

As he turns, SAM is standing right in front of him. DEAN jumps back, automatically raising his shotgun.

DEAN
Man, answer me when I'm calling you! You alright?

SAM
Yeah. I'm fine.

DEAN
You know it wasn't me who called your cell, right?

SAM
Yeah, I know. I think something lured me down here.

DEAN
I think I know who. Dr. Ellicott. That's what the spirits have been trying to tell us. You haven't seen him, have you?

SAM
No. How do you know it was him?

DEAN
’Cause I found his log book. Apparently he was experimenting on his patients, awful stuff. Makes lobotomies look like a coupla aspirin.

SAM
But it was the patients who rioted.

DEAN
Yeah. They were rioting against Dr. Ellicott. Dr. Feelgood was working on some sort of, like, extreme rage therapy. He thought that if he could get his patients to vent their anger then they would be cured of it. Instead it only made them worse and worse and angrier and angrier. So I'm thinking, what if his spirit is doing the same thing? To the cop? To the kids in the seventies, making them so angry they become homicidal.... Come on, we gotta find his bones and torch ’em.

SAM
How? The police never found his body.

DEAN
The log book said he had some sort of hidden procedure room down here somewhere where he'd work on his patients. So, if I was a patient I'd drag his ass down here, do a little work on it myself.

SAM
I don't know, it sounds kinda...

DEAN
Crazy?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Yeah. Exactly.

DEAN opens another door, looks inside, then gestures with his head for SAM to follow. Close up of SAM giving DEAN a stealthy, sly look.

They both enter the room.

SAM
I told you I looked everywhere. I didn't find a hidden room.

DEAN
Well, that's why they call it hidden...(wind noise) You hear that?

SAM
What?

DEAN
(looking around, crouching and holding his hand out) There's a door here.

SAM
(pointing his gun at DEAN.) Dean. (A trickle of blood runs from his nose) Step back from the door.

DEAN
(rising to his feet, his eyes going from the gun to SAM's face) Sam, put the gun down.

SAM
Is that an order?

DEAN
Nah, it's more of a friendly request.

SAM
(raising his gun to point at DEAN's chest) ’Cause I'm getting pretty tired of taking your orders.

DEAN
I knew it. Ellicott did something to you.

SAM
For once in your life, just shut your mouth.

DEAN
What are you gunna do, Sam? Gun's filled with rock salt. It's not gunna kill me.

SAM shoots DEAN in the chest. The shot blasts him backwards through the hidden door to fall on the floor.

SAM
No. But it will hurt like hell.

END ACT FOUR...........

ACT FIVE
INTERIOR. BASEMENT. HIDDEN ROOM.

DEAN lies on the floor, coming to and gasping for breath.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM stands over him.

DEAN
We gotta burn Ellicott's bones and all this will be over, and you'll be back to normal.

SAM
I am normal. I'm just telling the truth for the first time. I mean, why are we even here? ’Cause you're following Dad's orders like a good little solider? Because you always do what he says without question? Are you that desperate for his approval?

DEAN
This isn't you talking, Sam.

SAM
That's the difference between you and me. I have a mind of my own. I'm not pathetic, like you.

DEAN
So what are you gunna do, huh? Are you gunna kill me?

SAM
You know what, I am sick of doing what you tell me to do. We're no closer to finding Dad today than we were six months ago.

DEAN
Well, then here. Let me make it easier for you. (He holds his Smith & Wesson toward SAM.) Come on. Take it. Real bullets are gonna work a hell of a lot better than rock salt. (SAM hesitates) Take it!!

SAM points the gun at DEAN's face.

DEAN
You hate me that much? You think you could kill your own brother? Then go ahead. Pull the trigger. Do it!

SAM pulls the trigger. The chamber is empty. He tries again, and once more. DEAN uses a right cross to knock SAM to the ground and struggles to get up.

DEAN
(moving to stand over SAM) Man, I'm not going to give you a loaded pistol!

SAM stares up at him. DEAN delivers a vicious right cross to knock SAM out, almost falling as he does so.

DEAN
(patting his brother) Sorry, Sammy.

DEAN begins looking around the room, pushing back ragged curtains with his pistol. DR. ELLICOTT glides past but DEAN doesn't notice. He sees a tuft of something poking out of the corner of a closed cupboard and moves closer. He opens the door to find a mummified corpse and flinches back from the smell, gagging.

DEAN
Oh, that's just gross.

DEAN
(salting the body) Soak it up.

DEAN drops the salt container and grabs a small tin of kerosene, squirting the body. In the background his torch flicker, unnoticed. A gurney comes flying across the room and knocks him to the ground. DR. ELLICOTT grabs his face and his hands light up.

ELLICOTT
Don't be afraid. I'm going to help you. I'm going to make you all better.

DEAN struggles to reach his bag with one hand, finds his lighter, flicks it on and tosses it at the mummified body. DR. ELLICOTT lets go of DEAN as his remains start to burn. DEAN crawls out of the way and watches as DR. ELLICOTT 's ghost turns black and falls to the ground, crumbling on impact.

SAM wakes up and DEAN looks over at him as he flexes his jaw painfully.

DEAN
You're not going to try and kill me, are ya?

SAM
(raising his hand to push at his jaw) No.

DEAN
Good. Because that would be awkward.

...................

EXTERIOR. DAYBREAK. OUTSIDE ASYLUM.

KAT
Thanks, guys.

GAVIN
Yeah. Thanks.

DEAN
No more haunted asylums, okay?

They watch GAVIN and KAT walk toward their car, then turn to the Impala.

SAM
Hey, Dean?

DEAN turns to look at him.

SAM
I'm sorry, man. I said some awful things back there.

DEAN
You remember all that?

SAM
Yeah. It's like I couldn't control it. But I didn't mean it, any of it.

DEAN
You didn't, huh?

SAM
No, of course not! Do we need to talk about this?

DEAN
(moving to get in the Impala) No. I'm not really in the sharing and caring kinda mood. I just wanna get some sleep.



END TEASER
INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

Camera pans over DEAN, asleep in bed.

A phone rings.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN doesn't move. Frowning, SAM grabs DEAN’s phone from the end table and checks the number, then flips it open.

SAM
Hello.

He listens, then sits straight up in bed.

SAM
Dad?
