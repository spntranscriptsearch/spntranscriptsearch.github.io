NOW
EXT. RAILWAY – NIGHT


Someone we can see only from the legs downwards is breathing heavily as they run slowly along the railway track. The person leaves the track and bumps into a MAN walking alongside it.


MAN
Hey! Dick!


The person who was running turns around and we see that it is SAM. SAM then starts to run again, goes through a gate, and walks along a heavily-graffitied alleyway. A woman is buying drugs from a DEALER. The woman leaves and SAM walks closer to the DEALER.


DEALER
Dude. Get the hell away from me.


SAM rubs a hand over his face. He looks exhausted.


DEALER
You speak friggin' English? Go away!


SAM
It's okay. No one's after me.


DEALER
Why are you running up in here like that?


SAM
Just... Just leave me alone.


SAM slides down to the ground with his back against a post.


DEALER
What the hell did you take, anyway?


SAM
Nothing.


DEALER
Shut up.


HALLUCIFER
No, he's telling the truth. Burned through that last beer hours ago. Right about the time Dean passed out. Come on, Sam. Tell the nice tweaker. You'd be sleeping by now if the devil would just leave you alone for five seconds. Stupid Satan. Chasing you all the way to... Where the hell are we?


SAM
[Holding his face in his hands] Gah! I just need some rest.


HALLUCIFER
Hey. Sam. Try the hand scar.


SAM
Ugh!


DEALER
How many days you been up, anyway?


HALLUCIFER
Four. Oh. Wait. [Looks at his watch] Scratch that. Five.


SAM gets to his feet and starts to walk away.


DEALER
Hey, hold up! Wait! Hold up!


SAM turns around.


DEALER
You want to knock out? I can knock you out.


CUT TO: SAM and the DEALER are asleep in the front seats of a car. Something shatters the windshield, spraying glass over SAM. SAM gets out. A bar is protruding through the shattered windshield, but when SAM looks again, the windshield is intact. HALLUCIFER appears behind SAM.


HALLUCIFER
[singing and making hand motions] Good morning to you, good morning to you…


SAM walks away.


HALLUCIFER
[singing and making hand motions] …our day is beginning, so good morning to you.

[calls after SAM] I thought you liked my singing!


CUT TO: HALLUCIFER walking just behind SAM. SAM is breathing heavily and blinking rapidly.


HALLUCIFER
Pills? You do get that you're just bringing free drugs to the party, right? I am inside you, Sam. Hey. Sam. What's the longest a normal human being has ever gone without sleep? 11 days. [chuckles] Hey. You always wanted to be normal, Sam!


CUT TO: SAM running away from HALLUCIFER.


HALLUCIFER
If you are, you'll be dead in a week!


SAM runs in front of a car, which hits him and sends him up onto the windshield, over the car and to the ground.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

A DOCTOR is working at his desk. DEAN opens the door and enters, followed by a NURSE.


NURSE
Okay, sir? You can't just barge in here without an appointment!


DEAN
They said, "Talk to Kadinsky." You Kadinsky?


NURSE
You need to be scheduled!


DEAN
Well, then, schedule me! He was in a car crash. Why the hell can't I see him?


DR KADINSKY
You're Sam Smith's brother.


DEAN
Yeah, what's going on?


DR KADINSKY
[to the NURSE] It – it's fine. Thank you. Really.


The NURSE leaves.


DR KADINSKY
Sam was admitted. He was treated for a broken rib and lacerations.


DEAN
Okay. That's not too bad. And?


DR KADINSKY
And... he's on our locked psychiatric floor.


DEAN looks surprised.


DEAN
I mean, he's had some trouble...


DR KADINSKY
So you're aware that Sam is experiencing a full-blown psychotic episode?


DEAN
Psychotic? Come on. I mean, the guy's... It's not like the guy's freakin' Norman Bates.


DR KADINSKY
No, I'm sure he isn't. We need to determine whether his state was brought on by the insomnia or whether the insomnia is a symptom of his condition. Do you understand? So that we can figure out how to treat him.


DEAN
Well, all I can say is that the sleep thing is – is kind of new.


DR KADINSKY
Right. Well... we've pumped him about as full of sedatives as we safely can. So far, he won't go under. I've never seen anything like it.


CUT TO: DR KADINSKY pushing a button to enter Ward D2. A sign on the wall and the door read “High Security Area”. He and DEAN walk down the hallway in the ward.


CUT TO: SAM’s hospital room. HALLUCIFER is sitting on a desk, playing with a piece of string. SAM is on the bed, dressed in a white T-shirt and white hospital pants.


HALLUCIFER
I'm just sayin'. Back when you had no soul...


DR KADINSY and DEAN appear at the door.


HALLUCIFER
...you never had to sleep.


DEAN enters the room.


HALLUCIFER
Ah, Mr. Helpless. Pull up a six-pack, buddy.


DEAN
How are you feeling?


SAM
Maybe you should cancel my UFC fight.


HALLUCIFER
Yeah. Keep that sense of humor, Sam. It'll get you through this.


DEAN sits down on the end of SAM’s bed.


DEAN
Sam, I'm gonna find you help.


SAM exhales and looks away.


HALLUCIFER
Now, that sounded a little cynical.


SAM
I don't think it's out there, Dean.


DEAN
We don't know that.


SAM
We know better than most. It's all snake oil. Last faith healer we hooked up with had a reaper on a leash. Remember?


DEAN stands up.


DEAN
Yeah, Sam, I remember.


SAM
I'm just saying...


DEAN
What? That you don't want my help?


SAM
No, I'm just saying… don't do this to yourself.


DEAN
Sam, if I don't find something –


SAM
Then I'll die.


HALLUCIFER
Oh, you're upsetting me.


SAM
Dean, we knew this was coming.


DEAN
No.


SAM
When you put my soul back...


DEAN
No.


SAM
...Cas warned you about all the crap it would –


DEAN
Screw Cas! Quit being Dalai frickin' Yoda about this, okay? [punches his hand with his fist] Get pissed!


SAM
[sighs] I'm too tired. This is what happens when you throw a soul into Lucifer's dog bowl. And you think there's just gonna be some cure out there?


SAM looks at DEAN sadly. DEAN nods and bites his lip.


HALLUCIFER
Oh, you guys are having a moment.


DEAN leaves the room.


INT. HOUSE – DAY


DEAN is looking through a journal and talking on the phone.


DEAN (on phone)
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's. I'm looking for some info. If you could, uh, call me back. 785-555-0128. Thanks.


He hangs up and crosses a name off a list.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


The NURSE is taking SAM’s blood pressure and temperature as HALLUCIFER looks on.


INT. HOUSE – DAY


DEAN (on phone)
[sarcastically] I am so sorry to have bothered you.


DEAN crosses another name off his list. Eight names are now crossed off.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


HALLUCIFER is reading from a large book. SAM is sitting on the edge of the bed, facing away from HALLUCIFER.


HALLUCIFER
Narcissistic personality disorder. Okay, now, this one I could have.


The NURSE enters.


NURSE
Time for meds, Sam.


HALLUCIFER
Sets unrealistic goals. Check. But trouble keeping healthy relationships? Not so sure about that one. Thoughts?


INT. HOUSE – DAY


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah. Thanks.


DEAN hangs up, crosses out another name, closes the journal and picks up a smaller journal. He tosses the smaller journal onto a table as he walks to the refrigerator. As he is taking out a can, the journal falls to the ground. DEAN picks it up. A business card for Mackey’s Taxidermy has fallen out. On the back is a cell phone number.


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah, hi. Uh... my name's Dean. I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's. I'm, uh, looking for some info. If you could call me back at 785-555-0128. Thanks.


DEAN hangs up.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


SAM is sitting on the edge of his bed with his eyes closed. DR KADINSKY enters.


DR KADINSKY
Sam, how are we feeling today? Rib pain – scale of 1 to 10?


SAM
It's – it's not bad. Um [clears throat] Three.


DR KADINSKY
You don't have to lie, Sam.


SAM
I'm – I'm not.


DR KADINSKY
You've suffered terrible agony. I mean, your 10 must be astronomical.


SAM
Yeah. I-I guess I have a high threshold.


DR KADINSKY
Yeah. But the worst is knowing that there's always a new 10.


SAM
What are you talking about?


DR KADINSKY
Well, I'm talking about the truly elegant torture I have prepared for you today…


DR KADINSKY morphs into HALLUCIFER.


HALLUCIFER
…Sam.


SAM gets up and turns away from HALLUCIFER.


SAM
Just stay the hell away from me.


HALLUCIFER
But it's – it's so nice chatting. Sam, I hate these one-sided conversations. Come on, buddy. [raises fists] Engage. Sam? You... me... locked ward. Is it me, or is this just like the Cage?


EXT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT


INT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT


SAM is sitting on the bed, yawning. An orderly brings in a tray. SAM picks up a plate holding a sandwich and sits down on the bed again. He takes a bite, then looks down at the sandwich and sees that it is crawling with maggots. He drops the sandwich to the floor and moves further up the bed. A GIRL wearing white hospital clothes with a bandage on her neck is watching from the doorway.


INT. HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN is doing a search on the laptop. He brings up the “Amazing Grace Helping Friends” website. His phone rings. The scene alternates between DEAN in the house and MACKEY standing next to his truck.


DEAN
This is Dean.


MACKEY
Mackey. Calling you back. Hey. Real sorry about Bobby.


DEAN
Yeah, me too.


MACKEY
Look, what you called about – I might have something for you. There's this guy. He goes by "Emmanuel." He kind of roams. First started hearing about him a couple of months back. How he was healing the sick, curing the crazy.


DEAN
Uh-huh.


MACKEY
Naturally, I think something in the milk ain't clean. Find this sucker, punch his clock. Right?


DEAN
Right.


MACKEY
Heard the best way to get to him is through his wife, Daphne, out in Colorado? So, I go. Tell her I'm going blind. It's true. My right eye's burnt out. She says, "Go home. He'll come." So, I go. I set every trap, every test in the book.


DEAN
That's what I would have done.


MACKEY
Emmanuel shows. He passes every one. There ain't nothing weird about this guy. Except... he's the real deal.


DEAN
What do you mean?


MACKEY
He touched me, and my eye was fixed. Look – I don't believe in much that don't suck your blood. But I wouldn't call you on a maybe.


INT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT


SAM is sitting on the edge of his bed, covering his ears and facing away from HALLUCIFER, who is talking through a loudspeaker.


HALLUCIFER
"Oh, my head hurts. Make it stop!"


GIRL
Hello?

The GIRL who watched SAM from the doorway earlier is standing in the room. She holds out a chocolate bar to SAM.


GIRL
You want this or not? I saw you yesterday.


SAM takes the chocolate bar.


GIRL
You didn't look too happy with your in-flight meal.


SAM
Thanks. Uh...


GIRL
Marin. No problem. Sam. Right?


The loudspeaker blares and SAM winces.


HALLUCIFER
"I'm Sam."


SAM covers his face and MARIN leaves.


HALLUCIFER
"Hello, Sam. Hi."


EXT. HOUSE – DAY


DEAN walks up the stairs to the front door and knocks. A MAN opens the door.


DEAN
Hi. Uh, is this, uh, Daphne Allen's house? I'm looking for Emmanuel.


MAN
Well, you found him. Daphne's resting. If you don't mind.


DEAN
Oh, yeah, sure.


EMMANUEL steps outside and closes the door.


DEAN
Um… So, I was hoping, uh…


Through the window, DEAN sees a WOMAN who is bound to a chair and gagged. He looks back at EMMANUEL, whose eyes turn black: he is a DEMON. The DEMON grabs DEAN and throws him against the door.


DEMON
You were saying, Dean?


DEAN
You know, I'd think twice. Or don't you know that your boss issued a hands-off memo?


DEMON
[laughs] Please. What have you done for him lately? Roman's head on a plate? No? Whatever Emmanuel is, Crowley's gonna want him – a lot more than he wants you these days. So...


The DEMON starts towards DEAN, who stabs it with his knife. The DEMON yells and light flashes from his eyes and mouth as it dies. DEAN pushes the DEMON down the stairs as he withdraws his knife. A man is standing at the bottom of the stairs. DEAN stares: it is the body of Jimmy Novak, CASTIEL’s former vessel.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
What was that?


ACT TWO
INT. DAPHNE ALLEN’S HOUSE – DAY


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL is removing the gag and ropes binding DAPHNE.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
That creature hurt you.


DAPHNE
I'm okay. But, Emmanuel... They were looking for you.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
It's okay.

[to DEAN] I'm Emmanuel.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL holds out his hand and DEAN shakes it.


DEAN
Dean. I'm...Dean.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Thank you for protecting my wife.


DEAN
Your wife. Right.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
I saw his face. His real face.


DEAN
He was a demon.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
A demon walked the Earth.


DEAN
Demons. Whackloads of them. You don't know about...?


DAPHNE
[to EMMANUEL/CASTIEL] You saw the demon's true face.

[to DEAN] Emmanuel has very special gifts.


DEAN
Yeah. I-I've heard that about... Emmanuel. That you can heal people up.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
I seem to be able to help to a certain degree. What's your issue?


DEAN
My brother.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


SAM is lying on the bed with his eyes closed. A firecracker pops and SAM starts. “Wake Up Little Susie” by the Everly Brothers plays.


♪ Wake up, little Susie ♪

♪ Wake up ♪

♪ Wake up, little Susie ♪

♪ Wake up ♪


HALLUCIFER lights a firecracker and tosses it to the floor.


♪ We’ve both been sound asleep ♪

♪ Wake up, little Susie and weep ♪


HALLUCIFER
You know, you're actually keeping it together better than I thought. Kind of... the way someone pinned under a bus keeps it together.


SAM
None of this is real.


HALLUCIFER
And yet... you know what really sucks? [Tosses another firecracker] It doesn't really matter. [Turns off the music] Because I won. Your madness won. I mean, look at you. It's hard to believe you were the guy that saved the world once.


An ORDERLY, MARCUS brings in a tray of food.


HALLUCIFER
Mmm! Sammy. What'll be today? Maggots again... Or, uh, tapeworm?


SAM
Thanks.


MARCUS
Yeah, no problem. How you doing?


SAM
Uh... little better. That girl, uh, Marin...


MARCUS
Look, I'm not really supposed to talk about it. Let's just say, unlike you, she didn't get here 'cause of no accident.


SAM lies back down on the bed. HALLUCIFER lights another firecracker and laughs as SAM flinches.


CAR – NIGHT


DEAN is driving with EMMANUEL/CASTIEL in the passenger seat.


DEAN
So, Daphne – is that, uh, your wife?


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
She found me and cared for me.


DEAN
Meaning?


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Oh, it's a...strange story. You may not like it.


DEAN
Believe me, I will.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
A few months ago, she was hiking by the river, and I wandered into her path, drenched and confused, and... unclothed. I had no memory. She said... God wanted her to find me.


DEAN
So who named you Emmanuel?


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Bouncybabynames.com.


DEAN
Well, it's working for you. Must be weird not knowing who you are.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Well, it's my life. And it's a good life.


DEAN
Yeah, well, what if you were some kind of... I don't know...bad guy?


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Oh, I... don't feel like a bad person.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


SAM gets up from the bed and stands at the window in his room


MARIN
Man, you must be really determined to wait out nap time.


MARIN holds up a chocolate bar.


MARIN
Here.


She tosses the chocolate bar onto the bed and turns to leave.


SAM
Wait. Uh... share this with me.


MARIN
Thanks. I don't know why I'm thanking you for a candy bar I stole.


SAM tries to tear the wrapper and can’t.


SAM
So, how long you been here?


MARIN
Five weeks and counting. Going for the record.


SAM
How come?


MARIN
It doesn't matter.


SAM
That's a lot of bandages for "it doesn't matter".


MARIN
You want the doctor answer? I'm psychotically depressed to a suicidal ideation.


SAM
And the not-doctor answer?


MARIN
I feel like crap. I just... want it to be over.


SAM
What?


MARIN
Everything. Come on. Tell me I'm young and have everything to live for.


SAM
Why would you believe me?


MARIN
True. I heard you're here because the voices won't let you sleep.


SAM
Just one, really.


MARIN
Who is it? Like Charlie Manson or the devil?


SAM
Kind of. Yeah.


MARIN
Me too. I...hear a voice.


SAM
Is that why you set the fire?


MARIN
Who told you that?


SAM
No one. The – they're burns, right?


MARIN
I didn't set the fire, o– he did! You know what? I don't even know why I'm talking.


SAM
Marin, it's okay.


MARIN
No, it's not! You are crazier than I am! Charles Manson tells you what to do. At least it's my own brother –


SAM
It's your brother?


MARIN
Yes. It sucks... when it's your dead brother saying... kill yourself to be with him... or he'll do it for you.


MARIN leaves the room.


CAR – NIGHT


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
So, your brother...


DEAN
Sam.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Sam. What's his diagnosis?


DEAN
Well, it's not exactly medical.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
That should be fine. I can cure illness of a spiritual origin.


DEAN
Spiritual? Okay. Someone did this to him.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
You're angry.


DEAN
Well, yeah. Dude broke my brother's head.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
He betrayed you, this dude. He was your friend?


DEAN
Yeah, well, he's gone.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Did you kill him? I sense that you kill a lot of people.


DEAN
Honestly, I-I-I don't know if he is dead. I just know that this... whole thing couldn't be messier. You know, I used to be able to just shake this stuff off. You know, whatever it was. It might take me some time, but... I always could. What Cas did... I just can't – I don't know why.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Well, it doesn't matter why.


DEAN
Of course it matters.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
No. You're not a machine, Dean. You're human. Your friend's name was Cas? That's an odd name.


EXT. STREET – DAY


DEAN parks the car and gets out.


DEAN
Oh, hey, hey. Just, uh, sit tight. I'll be right out, okay?


INT. CONVENIENCE STORE – DAY


DEAN takes out his phone. He hears the door open, and looks up at a mirror to see a man walking towards him. He takes out his knife. The man shoves DEAN into a wall and DEAN pushes the man into a refrigerator, shattering its glass door. As the man stands up, DEAN stabs him with his knife. Light flashes from the man’s face as he dies. DEAN picks up his phone and sees that the screen is broken.


DEAN
Oh, come on.


DEAN walks to the next aisle of the store and finds two more demons waiting for him. He raises the knife and swings at one of them, but the demon blocks his arm and the knife goes flying to the floor. DEAN punches the demon and it throws him into some shelves. While DEAN is still on the floor, someone stabs the demon from behind. Light flashes from its face. Black smoke pours from the mouth of the other demon as it leaves the body it was possessing.


DEAN
Emmanuel, you son of a bitch.


The first demon falls to the ground, revealing MEG, who is holding DEAN’s knife.


MEG
Emmanuel. Yeah, not so much.


DEAN
Meg.


MEG
Dean, Dean, Dean. You got some 'splainin' to do.


ACT THREE
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE – DAY


DEAN turns the sign on the door around so it reads “Closed” and pulls down the blind.


MEG
Rumors are really starting to fly about this Emmanuel fellow. My curiosity sure got revved up.


DEAN
Just tell me what you want, Meg.


MEG
Imagine my surprise when I track him down, and he's snuggled up with you. And he's the spitting image of poor, dead Castiel. So, Dean, what's poor, dead Castiel doing in that junker out there?


DEAN
Christmas caroling.


MEG
Fun. But how's he alive? Last I heard, he played God, went poof.


DEAN
I don't know. And neither does he, so you got to keep it shut.


MEG
Oh, I do?


DEAN
He doesn't know he's Cas.


MEG
I know. Been watching you for hours. So here's the deal. You might remember Crowley and me were frosty back in the day? Well, times haven't changed.


DEAN
Good.


MEG
That hurts my feelings. I've been good to you, Dean.


DEAN
No, you've been good to you, sweetheart.


MEG
Look. Right now…


DEAN takes some items from the shelves and puts them in his jacket.


MEG
…rumors of this wandering healer are strictly low-level. But body count's getting high enough to change that. Folks start poking, they sniff angel dust.


DEAN
Yeah, they start falling all over each other trying to tell Crowley.


MEG
Now picture Crowley with his hands on harmless little amnesia-Cas. Don't get me wrong. I'm gonna burn that smarmy dick. My time's coming. But right about now, my army-of-one situation is not cutting it. It's cold out here, there's a price on my ass, and I need friends.


DEAN
Yeah. I get that. But I ain't it.


MEG
That's where you're wrong, Dean. 'Cause I'm here to help you, and that makes us friends.


DEAN
Help, huh? You mean see if you can't turn harmless little Cas out there into an angel-sized weapon?


MEG
Like you're taking him caroling. And by the way, you really want to keep going with no backup? Hey, I don't trust you, either. But I could really use Emmanuel. And he trusts you. So for now, it's in everyone's best interests to hold hands and cross the street together, okay?


DEAN
We go straight to Sam. No detours.


MEG
I love it.


DEAN
And one more thing. My knife.


MEG holds up the bloody knife and DEAN takes it.


MEG
You sure we wouldn't be safer traveling with a full-throttle angel? I could jog his memory. Kidding! We wouldn't want to upset the poor guy.


EXT. STREET – DAY


DEAN and MEG walk up to EMMANUEL/CASTIEL.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Her face! She's one of –


MEG
It's okay. We come in different flavors.


DEAN
She's, uh... a friend.


MEG
Meg. Just here for moral support. I mean, after all, we go way back. Dean and me. Just met you, of course. But I think we're gonna be good friends, too.


DEAN
All right. Can we go?


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


MARIN walks down the hallway. SAM comes to his doorway.


SAM
Marin. Marin, hey. Hold on. Um...I'm sorry I upset you.


MARIN
It's okay.


SAM
Can I ask you something?


MARIN
About?


SAM
The fire.


MARIN
Look. You mean well, but you have no idea –


SAM
You said you didn't start it. I believe you. I can help you, Marin, before he tries to hurt you again.


They go into SAM’s room. HALLUCIFER is leaning against the wall.


MARIN
You're worse. Your organs need sleep, you know. Your hair and nails are gonna fall out, and your kidneys are gonna shut down. I saw it in a movie. Sorry.


HALLUCIFER laughs.


SAM
So, um, your brother – when did he pass?


MARIN
Uh, last year.


SAM
Do you see him?


MARIN shakes her head.


SAM
So... he just talks to you. I bet at first it wasn't so bad. You must have missed him. Did you just hear him at the house?


MARIN
Here too. Whenever I'm alone. I can always tell he's coming because I get these chills.


SAM
You feel cold.


MARIN
Yeah. I mean, you're right. At first it's like... I knew I was crazy, but... I didn't really care. I did miss him. But then... he started saying he was lonely. And he started to get mad. And one day he started yelling, and I tried to run but the door was locked. And when I turned around, the whole room was on fire. I barely got out. How can you help me?


SAM
I can put your brother to rest. He's, um... He's stuck here.


MARIN
For real? Like –


SAM
Like he's a ghost.


MARIN
Why should I trust you?


SAM
Because it's your only shot.


MARIN
Okay.


SAM
Okay. So, your brother – was he cremated? Buried?


MARIN
We cremated him.


SAM
And do you have anything of his?


MARIN touches a bracelet she is wearing.


MARIN
This. He made it for me. With a busted hand, too. Sliced it open doing stupid archery.


SAM
He bled on it?


MARIN
Probably.


SAM
Good. That's – that's good.


MARIN
Why is that good?


SAM
One more question. Is there any chance in hell you got a lighter?


CAR – NIGHT


DEAN is driving, EMMANUEL/CASTIEL is in the passenger seat and MEG is in the back seat.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
This silence is very uncomfortable. Is there something I should know?


MEG
I don't know. Dean?


DEAN
No. Meg has that effect. Awkward. You know?


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
That must be difficult for you.


MEG
Dean's making a joke, Emmanuel.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Oh.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


MARIN comes into SAM’s room holding up a cigarette lighter.


SAM
Nice. Where'd you score that?


MARIN
Grabbed it out of Marcus' pocket. Being locked up is really turning me into a decent criminal.


SAM closes the door and barricades it with a chair.


SAM
We're laying down a circle. Help me open these, okay?


They use small containers of salt to make a salt circle.


SAM looks up and sees HALLUCIFER blowing on the salt. SAM leans back against the wall.


SAM
You're gonna have to do this on your own. It's okay. I'm okay. I'm just having a little...


HALLUCIFER
Brown acid moment.


SAM
Dizzy thing. It'll pass.


HALLUCIFER
Definitely. When your heart stops.


SAM and MARIN are standing in a small salt circle.


SAM
Great. Now, um... stay with me in the circle. No matter what. No matter what happens, okay?


MARIN
What's gonna happen?


SAM
Give me the bracelet.


The lights flicker and SAM and MARIN’s breath becomes visible. The GHOST of MARIN’s brother appears.


GHOST
Marin, don't do this. Please.


SAM
Marin, give me the bracelet.


MARIN
I'm so sorry. I have to.


She breaks the bracelet from her wrist and gives it to SAM. The room shakes, the door flies open and the lights explode. SAM lights the bracelet and the GHOST burns up.


GHOST
Noooo!


SAM
Y-you got to go. Go.


MARIN
Thank you.


MARIN leaves. Two orderlies enter and grab SAM. We see white light, which becomes DR KADINSKY shining a flashlight in SAM’s face. HALLUCIFER is standing behind DR KADINSKY.


DR KADINSKY
Sam? How you feeling now?


HALLUCIFER
His soul is broken, Doc. Can you give him a pill?


DR KADINSKY
I can't give you any more medication. The potential for overdose is too great.


SAM looks at his fingernails, which are bloody.


DR KADINSKY
We need to talk about surgical solutions.


SAM
Surgical?


HALLUCIFER
Ooh. Lobotomy?


DR KADINSKY
It's okay. We're not talking lobotomy here.


HALLUCIFER
Darn.


DR KADINSKY
Sam. Are you with me? Sam?


We see nothing but white light again.


EXT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT


DEAN turns off the engine and gets out of the car. A number of people are standing around the emergency entrance to the hospital. DEAN walks around the car and joins EMMANUEL/CASTIEL and MEG.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Oh, gracious.


DEAN looks through binoculars at the people outside the emergency entrance.


MEG
Damn it. Demons.


DEAN
All of them?


MEG
No grass growing under your feet.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
How many of those knives do you have?


DEAN
Just the one.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Well, then, forgive me, but what do we do?


MEG
Yeah, Dean. Got any other ideas how we could blast through that?


DEAN
Excuse us. Meg?


MEG
Oh, for the love of...


DEAN and MEG walk a short distance away.


MEG
Sam's in there. I know you're enjoying the double dip with your old pal, but –


DEAN
You think it's that cut and dry? Really? You know what he did. And you want to tell him and just hope that he takes it in stride? He could snap. He could... disappear. Who knows?


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
I gather we know each other.


MEG
Just a dollop.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
You can tell me. I'll be fine.


DEAN
How do you know? You just met yourself. I've known you for years.


MEG
You're an angel.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
I'm sorry? Is that a flirtation?


MEG
No, it's a species. A very powerful one.


DEAN
She's not lying. Okay? That's why you heal people. You don't eat. I'm sure there's more.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Why wouldn't you tell me? Being an angel – it sounds pleasant.


DEAN
It's not, trust me. It's bloody, it's corrupt. It's not pleasant.


MEG
He would know. You used to fight together. Bestest friends, actually.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
We're... friends? Am I Cas? I-I had no idea. I don't remember you. I'm sorry.


MEG
Look. You got the juice. You can smite every demon in that lot.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
But I don't remember how.


DEAN
It's in there. I'm sure it's just like riding a bike.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
I don't know how to do that, either. [pause] All right, I'll try.


DEAN
This ain't gonna go well.


MEG
I don't know. I believe in the little tree topper.


Music plays as EMMANUEL/CASTIEL walks towards the hospital emergency entrance.


DEMON
Hey, I know you. You're dead.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
Yes, I've heard.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL grabs the DEMON by the front of his shirt. He then puts a hand on the DEMON’s head and the DEMON screams as white light streams from his face. EMMANUEL/CASTIEL flashes back to his time as CASTIEL in 4.01 Lazarus Rising. In the present, EMMANUEL/CASTIEL smites two demons simultaneously with a hand to each of their faces. His flashbacks continue - of him helping DEAN in 4.22 Lucifer Rising, breaking the wall in SAM's head and being handed a jar of blood by CROWLEY in 6.22 The Man Who Knew Too Much.


CASTIEL
[in flashback from 7.01 Meet the New Boss ] I'm sorry, Dean. [the souls return to Purgatory]


MEG
That's my boy.


One of the DEMONS tries to run away, but EMMANUEL/CASTIEL appears right in front of him.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL
I don't think running will save you.


EMMANUEL/CASTIEL puts a hand to the DEMON’S head and smites him. DEAN and MEG walk up behind EMMANUEL/CASTIEL.


MEG
That was beautiful, Clarence.


DEAN
Cas?


CASTIEL
I remember you.


CASTIEL turns to face DEAN.


CASTIEL
I remember everything.


ACT FOUR
EXT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT


CASTIEL
What I did. What I became. Why didn't you tell me?


DEAN
Because Sam is dying in there.


CASTIEL
Because of me. Everything. All these people. I shouldn't be here.


CASTIEL walks away.


DEAN
Cas. Cas!


[to MEG] You stay here.


[calls after CASTIEL] Cas!


INT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT


SAM is being wheeled down a hallway on a hospital bed by the orderly MARCUS. They enter a room.


SAM
Where... Where – where are we?


MARCUS
Electroshock therapy. Let's just get you settled. Don't be freaked. I've seen this help a lot of people.


SAM
Umm, umm – my brother.


MARCUS puts a mouth guard in SAM’s mouth.


MARCUS
Bite down.


MARCUS turns on the machine.


MARCUS
Ordinarily, they keep this thing set on low. But I was thinking we could experiment a little. What do you say, Sam?


MARCUS puts the electrodes on SAM’s head.


MARCUS
Let's get that head strapped in.


MARCUS' eyes turn black.


EXT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT


CASTIEL is walking away from the hospital, with DEAN close behind him.


DEAN
If you remember, then you know you did the best you could at the time.


CASTIEL
Don't defend me. Do you have any idea the death toll in Heaven? On Earth?


CASTIEL stops and turns to face DEAN.


CASTIEL
We didn't part friends, Dean.


DEAN
So what?


CASTIEL
I deserved to die. Now, I can't possibly fix it... So why did I even walk out of that river?


DEAN
Maybe to fix it. Wait.


DEAN opens the trunk of the car and takes out CASTIEL’s trenchcoat. He holds it out to CASTIEL.


INT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT


SAM is strapped to the bed and shaking from electric shocks.


MARCUS
Amazing. You just take those lickin’s, don't you, kid? Well, if it's meat, you can cook it. You just got to turn up the heat.


MARCUS turns towards the electroshock machine, but CASTIEL is there. CASTIEL puts a hand on MARCUS' head to smite him. MARCUS falls to the ground with his eyes burnt out. CASTIEL turns off the electroshock machine and takes away the electrodes on SAM’s head and the mouth guard.


CASTIEL
I should never have broken your wall, Sam. I'm here to make it right.


CASTIEL touches SAM’s head, but SAM doesn’t look better. SAM sees HALLUCIFER in CASTIEL’s place.


SAM
You're not real.


CASTIEL
Oh, Sam... I'm so sorry.


ACT FIVE
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


HALLUCIFER is sitting in a chair next to SAM’s bed, holding the book “Three Little Pigs”.


HALLUCIFER
I see that third little pig was smart. Went out and got some bricks.


DEAN and CASTIEL are standing in the room. The chair next to SAM’s bed is empty.


DEAN
What the hell do you mean you can't?


CASTIEL
I mean there's nothing left to rebuild.


DEAN
Why not?


CASTIEL
Because it crumbled. The pieces got crushed to dust by whatever's happening inside his head right now.


DEAN
So you're saying there's nothing? That he's gonna be like this until his candle blows out?


CASTIEL
I'm sorry. This isn't a problem I can make disappear. And you know that. [pause] But I may be able to shift it.


DEAN
Shift?


CASTIEL
Yeah, it would get Sam back on his feet.


CASTIEL sits on the bed close to SAM.


CASTIEL
It's better this way. I'll be fine.


SAM flinches.


DEAN
Wait, Cas, what are you doing?


CASTIEL
Now, Sam...


HALLUCIFER
This may hurt. And if I can't tell you again...


CASTIEL
...I'm sorry I ever did this to you.


CASTIEL puts a hand on SAM’s head. SAM groans in pain and his face and eyes glow red. The red travels up CASTIEL’s arm and face and his eyes turn red. SAM groans and gasps for breath.


DEAN
Sam?


DEAN walks around the bed to the other side.


SAM
Dean!


DEAN
Sam!


SAM
Cas? Cas, is that you?


CASTIEL sees HALLUCIFER on the bed in SAM’s place.


HALLUCIFER
Hello... brother.


CASTIEL stands up and backs away in horror. SAM and DEAN look at each other. HALLUCIFER laughs.


EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY


SAM and DEAN leave the building.


SAM
I don't know. I mean, we can't just leave him.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEAN (V-O)
Well, we can't bring him with us. Everything on the planet's out for us, okay?


CASTIEL is sitting sadly on the edge of a bed, dressed in white hospital clothes.


DEAN (V-O)
Word gets out, we can't protect him. Not really.


EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEAN
This is safer.


DEAN and SAM stop at the driver’s and passenger doors of the car and talk over the car.


DEAN
Every demon who knows about Cas is dead.


SAM
Not everyone. Look, Dean, this whole "enemy of my enemy is my friend" thing feels kind of like a demon deal.


DEAN
It's not a deal. It's –


SAM
It's what?


DEAN
Mutually assured destruction. Look, man, I get it. She's not our friend. We don't even have friends. All our friends are dead.


DEAN gets into the car.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DR KADINSKY is sitting at his desk reading a piece of paper.


DR KADINSKY
Well, you certainly have experience. I'm impressed. Tell me – why do you want to join our staff?


MEG
I really just want to help the patients. Watch over them. Not to be immodest, but I feel like I'd make a great fit.


DR KADINSKY
I can't argue with that.


DR KADINSKY stands up and offers MEG his hand.


DR KADINSKY
Welcome to the team... Nurse Masters.
