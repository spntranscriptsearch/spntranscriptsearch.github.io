TEASER
INTERIOR OPENS UP INSIDE WITH A VIEW OF AN ARCADE GAME. SCENE CHANGES TO REVEAL A WOMAN PLAYING THE GAME INSIDE A BAR. THE BARTENDER IS CLEANING UP.

MAN: Unplugging things now. Hint, hint.

BENJAMIN: Yes, I'm almost finished.

MAN: You don't have to beat that game every night.

BENJAMIN: I disagree.

MAN: (carrying a trash bag) Fine. I'm gonna take this out. Time I get back, we are closed. You leave. End of story.

BENJAMIN CONTINUES PLAYING. SOMEONE ENTERS.

LILY SUNDER: You're too old for video games.

BENJAMINE TURNS TO LOOK AT LILY

LILY: Oh.

BENJAMIN: Were you waitin' to play?

LILY: Everyone deserves a turn.

BENJAMIN: (scoffs) I'm sorry. Have we met?

LILY: Have we?

BENJAMIN TURNS TO LEAVE

BENJAMIN: Move out of my way.

LILY: Or?

BENJAMIN: Or I will move you.

LILY: Really? Go ahead. Try.

BENJMIN STEPS TO GET AROUND LILY WHO MOVES TO BLOCK.

BENJAMIN: Suit yourself.

BENJAMIN RAISES HER HAND AS IF TO SMITE BUT IS STOPPED BY SOMETHING. SHE TRIES AGAIN WITH THE SAME RESULT.

LILY: Oh, Benjamin. Your little angel tricks won't work on me.

BENJAMIN PRODUCES AN ANGEL BLADE. LILY BACKS UP A STEP.

BENJAMIN: Who are you?

LILY PRODUCES TWO ANGEL BLADES AND THEY BEGIN TO FIGHT. BENJAMIN LOSES HER BLADE.

BENJAMIN: Don't. Please.

LILY LAUGHS.

BENJAMIN: Oh-law zeer ah tee-loh-kah. Oh-law zeer ah tee-loh-kah. Yar-ree fee-fee-suh, pie neez.

ELECTRICTY CRACKLES IN THE BAR.

LILY: That's right. Call your friends.

BENJAMIN: Nuh-nah-ee-luh zee-rum ah-duh-fantuh. Nuh-nah-ee-luh zee-rum ah-duh-fantuh. Oh-law zeer ah tee-loh-kah. Yar-ree fee-fee-suh, pie neez. Yar-ree fee-fee-suh, pie neez. Nuh-nah-ee-luh zee-rum ah-duh-fantuh. Oh-law zeer ah tee-loh-kah. Oh-law zeer ah tee-loh-kah. Yar-ree fee-fee-suh, pie neez. Yar-ree fee-fee-suh, pie neez. Nuh-nah-ee-luh zee-rum ah-duh-fantuh. Nuh-nah-ee-luh zee-rum ah-duh-fantuh.

AS BENJAMIN SPEAKS THE SCENE SWITCHES TO SHOW MIRABEL, ISHIM AND CASTIEL IN TURN AS THE LIGHTS FLICKER. THEY LOOK AROUND AND THEN UP.

LILY: (softly) I've waited so long.

LILY STABS BENJAMIN AND LEAVES THE BAR.

TITLE CARD

ACT 1


INTERIOR: BUNKER, SAM AND DEAN ARE LOOKING AT A BOARD WITH A MAP WHERE THEY’RE TRYING TO TRACK KELLY’S MOVEMENTS.

SAM: Yeah, I was looking at that earlier. Cass has been busy, huh?

DEAN: Yeah, busy not finding Kelly Kline or her Rosemary's baby. I mean, how's a chick like this just drop off the map?

SAM SITS DOWN.

SAM: Well, I think that's what he's trying to figure out. Hey, you, uh, you hear from Mom yet?

DEAN: Yeah, she called last night, said she's got a line on a shapeshifter in Atlanta. I said we could come help, and she said, “Don't bother”. Apparently, she's “got it”.

SAM: Then she's probably got it.

DEAN: Yeah.

SAM: Mom's good.

DEAN: I just think she jumped back into this a little quick, don't you?

SAM: I don't think we have the kind of mom who's gonna stay home and make us chicken soup for dinner, you know? You talk to Cass yet?

DEAN: No.

SAM: So, what, you're just gonna keep walking past each other in the kitchen, not saying a word?

DEAN: Maybe.

SAM: Look, yes, Cass killed Billie, but he saved us. He saved Mom. How long are you gonna stay pissed?

DEAN: I'm not pissed that he cares about us, you know. I'm – I'm grateful. But Billie said there would be “cosmic consequences” if that deal got broken. You have any idea what that means?

SAM: No.

DEAN: Neither do I, but I'm pretty sure it ain't jellybeans and g-strings.

SAM: My point is, Cass thought he was doing the right thing.

CASS: I was doing the right thing.

CASS WALKS UP TO SAM AND DEAN.

DEAN: You sure about that?

CASS: Yes.

DEAN: Yeah? Well, I'm not so sure. And when the other shoe drops –

CASS: I'll deal with it. I have to go.

SAM: Got a lead on Kelly?

CASS: No. This is personal.

DEAN: Meaning what?

CASS: Another angel. An old friend. He called out for help.

DEAN: Oh. Good old reliable angel radio.

CASS: He was begging for help and then he just stopped. I need to know if he's still alive.

SAM: Yeah, all right. Well... we'll come with you.

CASS: Both of you?

CASS LOOKS AT DEAN.

DEAN: Sure. Yeah, we could help. Gotta make sure you don't do anything else stupid.

EXTERIOR: NIGHT, IN THE IMPALA WHERE IT’S QUIET AND AWKWARD WITH THE ONLY SOUND BEING THE ENGINE OF THE IMPALA.

SAM: All right, who wants music?

DEAN: I'm good.

SAM: You? Okay. Cass, is there anything specific we should know about your friend?

MORE SILENCE. SAM LOOKS AROUND AND SHAKES HIS HEAD.

SAM: All right. Guys, you know what? This – this silent treatment thing, it's silly. It's not gonna work. Whatever we're walking into, we should, you know, probably have an actual plan.

CASS: (sighs) What do you wanna know?

DEAN: Oh, he speaks.

SAM: Enough. Cass, you said when you heard Benjamin, he – he was screaming.

CASS: It was, um... Look, Benjamin wouldn't call for help lightly. And he wouldn't put himself in harm's way if he could help it.

DEAN: Wow, this Benjamin seems like he's pretty cool, you know. Like he wouldn't make any half-cocked, knee-jerk choices.

CASS: Yeah, you know what I like about him? Is that he's sarcastic, but he's thoughtful and appreciative, too.

DEAN: Now what is that supposed to mean?

SAM: Okay, okay, the road, road. Dude, watch the road.

DEAN: I got it.

SAM: Anything else, Cass?

CASS: Benjamin is always very careful. Long ago, he found a powerfully devout vessel in Madrid, and her faith, it... she gave him everything – her trust and her body.

DEAN: Wait. So Benjamin's a woman.

CASS: Benjamin is an angel. His vessel is a woman. But it – it's – it's more than that. She's not just his vessel.

SAM: She's... She's his friend.

CASS: Yeah. Benjamin would never put her in unnecessary danger.

DEAN: Okay, well, if this Benjamin is so careful, then what happened?

CASS: I don't know. That's what I need to find out.

INTERIOR: LILY’S HOTEL ROOM. SHE’S LAYING ON THE BED WHISPERING.

INTERIOR: THE BAR.

SAM: The police report is calling it a stabbing.

MAN: Sure, yeah. That's the official story. I mean, I was outside, and... Dead woman? No blood? Come on. And these crazy burn marks? It's a cult thing, right? That's why the FBI's –

CASS: Get out.

MAN: What?

CASS: Get out.

DEAN: He means we can take it from here. Thanks.

MAN: Yeah.

DEAN: We'll call you when we're done.

SAM: Dude. You all right?

CASS: No. No, Benjamin and I, we fought together. He was... he was a gifted soldier. I don't know how this could've happened.

DEAN REACHES DOWN AND FINDS AN ANGEL BLADE.

DEAN: Got something. Looks like we had a little angel-on-angel action.

CASS: This isn't Benjamin's blade.

CASS HEARS SOMETHING.

SAM: What?

CASS HEARS WHISPERING, SCENE CUTS TO LILY’S HOTEL ROOM WHERE SHE SITS UP ON THE BED.

LILY: Castiel.

SCENE SWITCHES BACK TO THE BAR.

CASS: We have to go. Now.

SCENE SWITCHES TO LILY’S HOTEL ROOM WHERE SHE KISSES HER FINGER TIPS AND PLACES THEM ON A PICTURE OF A LITTLE GIRL.

EXTERIOR: NIGHT, OUTSIDE THE WRIGHT SPOT. SAM, DEAN, AND CASS EXIT THE IMPALA.

SAM: All right, who we meetin'?

CASS: His name is Ishim. Before I, uh, commanded my own flight of angels, my own battalion, I served under him with Benjamin.

DEAN: And you think he knows what's going on?

CASS: We'll find out. You wait here.

DEAN: Whoa, wait. Excuse me?

CASS: Ishim said to come alone. He doesn't like humans. If I plan to do anything else stupid, I'll let you know.

SAM AND DEAN LOOK AT EACH OTHER AS CASS WALKS INSIDE.

CASS: Mirabel. Ishim.

CASS SITS DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH ISHIM.

CASS: Kept your vessels all this time. I'm impressed.

MIRABEL: We are not careless.

ISHIM:. But you, Castiel... I liked the old you better.

MIRABEL: We've been waiting. I suppose it does take longer to get places now without our wings. You had a hand in that, correct?

ISHIM: Now, Mirabel, some angels think of Castiel as a hero. After he left us, he had his own flight to command. Balthazar, Uriel. Great soldiers. Both dead now, of course. You had a hand in that, too. So is he a hero? Is he a spanner in the works? I don't know.

CASS: I'm not a hero, but sometimes doing the right thing requires sacrifices.

ISHIM: True, but it just always seems that it's other angels sacrificing for your good deeds. Their wings, their lives.

CASS: Are you here to insult me or talk about Benjamin?

ISHIM: Can't we do both?

MIRABEL: In the years since we lost our wings, two others from our flight have been murdered, like Benjamin.

ISHIM: We're all that's left.

CASS: Why didn't I know about this?

MIRABEL: We didn't think you'd care.

EXTERIOR: NIGHT, DEAN IS PACING.

SAM: And you're gonna storm in right... now.

DEAN GOES INSIDE AND SAM FOLLOWS.

DEAN: Hey.
CASS: Dean.

DEAN: Feel a little left out over there. Scoot over.

SAM AND DEAN SQUEEZE INTO THE BOOTH WITH CASTIEL.

ISHIM: I said to come alone.

ISHIM POURS TWO PACKETS OF SUGAR INTO HIS COFFEE.

CASS: These are my friends – my friends who don't listen very well.

SAM: How you doing? I'm –

MIRABEL: We know who you are.

ISHIM: Check outside to see if there are others.

MIRABEL LEAVES AS ISHIM STIRS HIS COFFEE.

CASS: I only brought Sam and Dean.

ISHIM: As far as you know.

EXTERIOR: NIGHT, MIRABEL LOOKS AROUND, HEARS A CRASH AND TURNS TO LOOK.

LILY: Mirabel, right?

MIRABLE SCREAMS AS LILY STABS HER WITH AN ANGEL BLADE.

INTERIOR WHERE ISHIM, SAM, DEAN, AND CASS ARE STILL SITTING IN A BOOTH.

DEAN: Well, who wants some pie?

ISHIM: You know, when I knew Castiel, he was a soldier. He was a warrior. He was an angel's angel. Now look how far he's fallen.

ISHAM POURS TWO MORE PACKETS OF SUGAR INTO HIS COFFEE.

DEAN: How about a little coffee with that sugar?

ISHIM AND DEAN STARE AT EACH OTHER THEN ISHIM LOOKS AT CASTIEL.

ISHIM: No wings, no home. Just a ratty old coat and a pair of poorly trained monkeys.

DEAN: Oh. Well, you can go to Hell.

CASS: Dean, it's fine.

SAM: No. No, it's not.

CASS: Sam, this isn't about me. It's about Benjamin.

ISHIM: Now that is refreshingly accurate. But since you brought a couple of extra “people” to our little chitchat, we should go somewhere more private. I have a safe house nearby.

ISHIM STANDS.

ISHIM: I'll go get Mirabel. [ Bills rustling ] So nice to see you, old friend. Have some pie.

ISHIM THROWS SOME MONEY ON THE TABLE BEFORE WALKING OUT.

SAM: Wow.

SAM MOVES OVER TO THE SEAT ISHIM VACATED.

SAM: Hell of a friend, Cass.

DEAN: Why do you let him talk to you like that?

CASS: If Ishim can help me find whoever killed Benjamin, then I have to.

DEAN: Okay, yeah, look, I-I get that we need super dick there, but, I mean, come on.

CASS: The angels that I served with are being killed. So I will put up with Ishim, I will put up with everything else, and so will you. I have to go.

DEAN GETS UP TO LET CASS OUT OF THE BOOTH. THE BROTHERS WATCH AS CASS WALKS OUT.

EXTERIOR: NIGHT, ISHIM IS LOOKING FOR MIRABEL WHO HE SEES LAYING ON THE GROUND

ISHIM: Mirabel.

ISHIM LEANS OVER MIRABEL THEN LOOKS AROUND WHEN HE HEARS SOMEONE APPROACHING.

ISHIM. You!

LILY SLASHES THE ANGEL BLADE ACROSS ISHIM’S SIDE. ISHIM TRIES BUT FAILS TO SMITE LILY.

LILY: (laughs) You can't smite me, Ishim. I'm not powerless anymore.

ISHIM: But how – No! Castiel. Kill her!

ISHIM HEAD BUTTS LILY AS CASTIEL SLASHES HER IN THE SIDE. LILY DROPS HER BLADE.

LILY: Ah! Aah! Oh!

LILY DROPS HER BLADE. CASS REMEMBERS LILY FROM ANOTHER TIME.

CASS: I know you.

CASS APPROACHES LILY AS SHE KICKS HIM AWAY.

SAM: Hey!

BOTH WINCHESTERS COCK THEIR GUNS.

LILY: I don't wanna hurt you. I don't want to hurt any human. Just let me finish what I started.

DEAN: Yeah, not gonna happen, Patches.

LILY FLOODS THE AREA WITH A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT.

SAM: Can't see. Sam?

SAM: Hey.

A CAR STARTS AND DRIVES OFF.

DEAN: I can't see. Did you get a plate?

SAM: Yeah, I got it.

DEAN: Who the hell was that?!

ACT 2
EXTERIOR: DAY. THE OUTSIDE OF A CHURCH. SCENE CHANGES TO INTERIOR OF THE SAME CHURCH. ISHIM IS LOOKING AT THE SLASH IN HIS SIDE.

CASS: Ishim, let me tend to your wound.

ISHIM: I'm fine.

CASS: Ishim, how is she still alive?

SAM: Wait a second. You know her?

CASS: Yes.

ISHIM: You don't owe them an explanation.

DEAN: Okay, hang on now. Uh, One-Eyed Willy back there wasn't trying to kill us. She was after you. So talk before she kicks in the damn door.

CASS: Before the Apocalypse, angels, um... well, we rarely came to Earth.

SAM: Yeah, uh, basically never, right?

SAM: Right, except this once. Many years ago, there was an anomaly.

SAM: An anomaly?

ISHIM: They won't understand.

DEAN: Cass, what's going on? ♪

FLASHBACK TO ORONO MAINE 1901. EXTERIOR SCENE, DAYLIGHT. A GROUP IS WALKING THROUGH TREES INTO A FIELD WHERE THEY SEE A HOUSE.

ISHIM: Castiel, are we all here?

CASTIEL: Yes.

BENJAMIN: Why are we even on Earth? It's so wet.

MIRABEL: Stop complaining.

ISHIM: We're here because one of our fellow angels has taken a human wife. They also have a small daughter.

CASTIEL: A Nephilim? You're sure?

ISHIM: Father has wings. Mother's a primate. And this child has a human soul mixed with angelic grace. Now that's –

MIRABEL: Dangerous. Nephilim are forbidden by the oldest laws in heaven.

BENJAMIN: We jumped down here for a kid?

CASTIEL: Nephilim grow up. They grow into their power and then –

MIRABEL: Entire worlds die.

ISHIM: So we've come to set things right.

SIX ANGELS WALK TOWARD THE HOUSE. THE DOOR OPENS AND TWO INDIVIDUALS EXIT.

LILY: Akobel, please.

AKOBEL: Go back inside. Just... (Whispers indistinctly)

LILY TURNS AND GOES INSIDE THE HOUSE.

AKOBEL: You have no business here.

ISHIM: Me? You were sent here to observe humanity, to watch and to learn. But instead, taking up with a filthy animal. Have you no shame?

AKOBEL: Who are you to lecture me about shame? Humans aren't animals. Most of them are good and true and... How could anyone know them and not love them?

ISHIM: Touching, but we're not –

AKOBEL: I know why you're here.

ANGEL BLADES ARE PRODUCED. AKOBEL BEGINS TO FIGHT BUT BENJAMIN AND MIRABEL GRAB HIS ARMS.

ISHIM: CASTIEL.

CASTIEL. Akobel, Seraphim of the Sixth Choir, you have lain with a human and you fathered a Nephilim.

AKOBEL: What?

ISHIM GRABS AKOBEL’S THROAT STOPPING HIM FROM TALKING.

ISHIM: Continue.

CASTIEL: You have broken our most sacred oath, and the penalty is...

MIRABEL STABS AKOBEL.

CASTIEL: …death.

ISHIM: Dispose of his vessel. This next part, I'll do alone. [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ]

THE ANGELS WATCH AS ISHIM ENTERS THE HOUSE.

THE ANGELS CAN HEAR LILY FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.

LILY: No! No! Stay away from my daughter!

A GIRL SCREAMS.

PRESENT DAY, INTERIOR OF CHURCH.

SAM: Cass, you, um...

CASS: We completed a mission.

DEAN: Some mission.

CASS: It was horrific, but it was necessary. It was right.

DEAN: Well, you say so.

SAM: And the woman?

ISHIM: Lily Sunder. She was a professor of Apocalyptic Literature. Studied angels, speaks fluent Enochian. I took mercy on her by letting her live.

DEAN: And now she wants revenge.

ISHIM: Hmm. Mm-hmm.

SAM: I mean, she's gotta be what, 100 years old?

CASS: No. More.

DEAN: Yeah, but somehow, she's still kicking ass?

ISHIM: No. Not somehow. I know what she's up to. She made some kind of demonic pact. Keeps her young, keeps her strong. Keeps her immune from our powers.

DEAN: All right, but we'll find her, me and Sam.

CASS: No, Dean.

DEAN: Cass, she doesn't care about us, okay? She's gunning for you guys.

SAM: Yeah, maybe we can reason with her.

CASS: Uh, four dead angels indicate that perhaps she is not reasonable. If she has this dark power, it will take all of us to fight her. And I need to heal your wound.

SAM: Wait – wait a second, Cass. Her family was murdered. I mean, I-I know you were just doing a job, but –

CASS: Are you saying that those angels deserved to die?

SAM: What?

CASS: You think I deserve to die?

DEAN: No, no. That's not what he's saying.

CASS: What is he saying?

SAM: I'm saying maybe if we find her, we can explain to her that you're different now, you know?

CASS: Sam, that won't work. She won't quit. Think about it. Would you?

ISHIM: Castiel's right. It won't work.

SAM: We have to try.

DEAN: He's right, and we're not askin'.

SAM AND DEAN EXIT THE CHURCH.

LILY LOOKS AT HER WOUND, EXHALING SHARPLY AT THE PAIN. USING ANGEL POWERS SHE HEALS HERSELF.

ACT 3
INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH. CASS IS HELPING ISHIM.

ISHIM: The way you let those simians talk to you... Castiel, when did you get so gooey? You know why we're meant to stay away from them humans? Hmm? It's not because we're a danger to them. They're a danger to us. Case in point.

CASS: Well, my friendship with Sam and Dean has made me stronger.

ISHIM: You can't really believe that.

CASS: Your wound is deep. This'll be painful.

CASS HEALS ISHIM BUT IT WEAKENS HIM.

INTERIOR OF AN ELEVATOR. THE DOORS OPEN.

DEAN: You sure about this address?

SAM: Well, Lily's car was a rental, so I called the company. I told them she was wanted for questioning by the FBI. They pinged the LoJack –

DEAN: Okay, you could've just said yes.

SAM: Yes. So what's the plan?

DEAN: Well, we knock on her door and ask her nicely not to kill anymore angels.

SAM: And if she says no?

DEAN: Then we burn that bridge when we come to it.

SAM AND DEAN TURN A CORNER AND RUN INTO LILY. SHE’S STARTLED AND PULLS THE ANGEL BLADES.

SAM: Whoa! Whoa!

DEAN: Give us a second.

LILY: How did you find me?

SAM: We're here to talk, that's it. We come in peace. Just hear us out. We heard what happened to your family.

LILY: My family?

DEAN: See, Cass is our family, so we can't let you hurt him.

LILY: Let me?

DEAN: We don't wanna kill you.

LILY: I don't wanna kill you.

SAM: Okay, good. Look, there we go. Agreed. Listen, it's not Cass' fault that Heaven has these crazy rules about Nephilim. Your daughter.

LILY: You think...

LILY DROPS THE BLADES AND WALKS TOWARD THE WINCHESTERS.

LILY: Her name was May, and she was beautiful.

FLASHBACK: AKOBEL AND LILY ARE SITTING AT A TABLE WHILE MAY IS SITTING ON A FLOOR, PLAYING WITH A DOLL AND HUMMING.

AKOBEL: (whispering) I find that doll disturbing.

LILY: (whispering) Her father gave it to her. She loves it. Let her be.

PRESENT DAY

LILY: I had a life, a wonderful life, until... They took everything from me.

FLASHBACK: SAME AS EARLIER WITH THE ANGELS BUT THIS TIME FROM LILY’S PERSPECTIVE.

LILY: Akobel, please.

AKOBEL: Go back inside. Take May. Run.

LILY LOOKS AT THE ANGELS, TURNS AND GOES INTO THE HOUSE. AKOBEL FACES THE ANGELS.

AKOBEL: You have no business here.

LILY GATHERS PAPERS IN THE HOUSE.

MAY: Mommy?

LILY: It's fine, sweetheart. Everything is going to be fine, I promise.

LILY HEARS AKOBEL GASP AS A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINES OUTSIDE. LILY DROPS THE PAPERS AND GRABS MAY.

LILY: Come on. Come on.

PRESENT DAY.

LILY: All my life, I dreamed about angels. I studied them. I made them my life's work, until finally I learned the spell to summon one – Ishim.

FLASHBACK AS LILY TALKS. ISHIM ENTERS THE HOUSE AND SEES LILY HOLDING MAY.

LILY: When I first saw him, it was like looking into the face of the Divine. I thought he was perfect. But he is a monster.

FLASHBACK: ISHIM WALKS TOWARDS LILY AND MAY.

LILY: Ishim, what have you done?

ISHIM: Oh. What have you done? I shared all of our secrets with you, taught you all of our ways for your precious studies. I... I loved you.

LILY: You didn't love me. You were obsessed with me. That isn't love.

ISHIM: I loved you. You threw me away for him.

ISHIM POINTS TOWARD THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE WHERE WE LAST SAW AKOBEL.

LILY: No. I never should've let you into my life. I needed Akobel to protect me from you.

ISHIM: Well, that didn't work, did it?

LILY: You killed him?

ISHIM: Obviously.

LILY:And now you're gonna kill me?

ISHIM: No. You broke my heart, Lily. Now I'm gonna break yours.

ISHIM USES HIS POWER TO PUSH BACK A SCREAMING LILY.

MAY: Mommy!

MAY SCREAMS AS ISHIM GRABS HER.

ISHIM: You are powerless to do anything.

LILY: No.

ISHIM: You...are...powerless.

LILY: No. No! Stay away from my daughter!

MAY SCREAMS AND THE SOUND OF AN ANGEL BLADE IS HEARD.

LILY: No!

MAY’S DOLL FALLS TO THE GROUND.

PRESENT DAY:

LILY: I had my daughter long before I ever laid eyes on an angel.

DEAN: Wait, so...

LILY: My daughter was human.

DEAN: Just... (clears his throat) Um...

DEAN TURNS AND LOWERS HIS VOICE.

DEAN: Are you buying any of this?

SAM: (whispers) Yeah, kinda.

DEAN: All right, well, we gotta make sure, you know. I mean, Ishim's a tool, but –

SAM: You know what?

DEAN: I'm gonna call Cass.

CELLPHONE RINGS.

DEAN: Come on, come on, come on. Yeah, he's not answering.

SAM: Okay. Just go. I'll stay here.

DEAN: What? And leave you here with her? You kidding me? She–

LILY: – She is no threat whatsoever to humans. And she can hear you. [ Exhales ]

DEAN: Okay. Okay.

DEAN WALKS AWAY LEAVING SAM IN THE HALL WITH LILY.

INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH. CASS IS SITTING DOWN WHILE ISHIM IS DOING PUSHUPS.

ISHIM: Mm. I haven't felt this good in a millennia. Mm!

CASS: Oh, goody.

ISHIM: Ah, quit your whinin'. You'll regain your strength soon enough.

CASS: Where's my phone?

ISHIM: You'll have to keep better track of your things, Castiel.

INTERIOR: LILY’S HOTEL ROOM. SHE’S LOOKING AT A PICTURE OF HER AND MAY.

SAM: Can I ask you a question?

LILY: Yeah.

SAM: I-I get wanting revenge. I-I really do. But...why wait so long?

LILY: I had no choice. Before the angels fell, before they lost their wings, there would've been no way to hunt them down. But now... Patience is a talent. You'd be amazed what a person can do with a little bit of purpose and an abundance of time.

SAM: Hmm. Ishim said you made some kind of pact, um... that you're using dark magic.

LILY: Did he? I've studied angels all my... very long life. I use their magic to fight, to hear them, to stay alive.

SAM: Enochian magic. That's...possible?

LILY: It is if you're willing to pay the price of admission. Every time I use one of their spells, a piece of my soul burns away. And once it's gone...

SAM: You won't feel anything anymore. You won't, uh, care about anything anymore. You won't be human anymore.

LILY: I used to dream about my daughter every night. Do you know what I dream about now? Nothing. You don't trust me. I understand. But when your brother confronts Ishim, the angel will kill him. Ishim's a big man in heaven. He's got too much to lose if the truth comes out. And when your brother's dead, you won't stand in my way anymore. You'll help me. And for that, I can wait.

ACT 4
INTERIOR: DEAN ENTERS THE CHURCH.

DEAN: Cass? Hey. You okay?

CASS: Yeah, I'm fine. And Ishim is fully recovered.

DEAN: Yeah. Okay. Uh, maybe wish you hadn't had done that just yet.

CASS: Wait, why?

DEAN: This Lily chick? Says that her daughter was human. I think Ishim... I think he's playing you.

ISHIM: You're back. So what's new?

ACT 5
INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH. CASS STRUGGLES TO STAND WHILE DEAN HELPS HIM.

CASS: Is it... is it true, Ishim?

ISHIM: Is what true?

CASS: Lily Sunder's daughter, was she human?

ISHIM: Who told you that?

DEAN: She did. Said you were pretty obsessed.

ISHIM: Well, she's a liar.

CASS: Why would she lie?

ISHIM: She's human. It's kinda what they do.

DEAN: Well, if she's a liar, she's pretty good at it. You, on the other hand, kind of suck.

ISHIM: Who are you gonna believe? Your brother, or some filthy ape who's always talking down to you, always mocking you.

DEAN: You know, Cass and I might not agree all the time, but at least he knows who his real friends are.

CASS: Why do his words bother you so much, Ishim?

ISHIM: Who is he to question my choices? Who is he to question yours?

CASS: Well, it seems that some of my choices may need to be questioned. Now tell me. The girl – was she human?

ISHIM: Oh, you're not gonna like the answer.

DEAN PULLS OUT AN ANGEL BLADE. HE RUSHES ISHIM BUT IS TOSSED BACK AGAINST A WALL. CASS THROWS A PUNCH BUT IT’S BLOCKED. ISHIM PUNCHES CASTIEL WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. ISHIM GRABS CASS BY THE COLLAR.

ISHIM: I used to envy you, Castiel. You believe that?

ISHIM PUNCHES CASS WHO HEAD BUTTS HIM. DEAN CUTS HIS PALM WITH AN ANGEL BLADE.

ISHIM: You survived Hell. You were chosen by God. But now look at you. You're just sad and pathetically weak.

ISHIM PUNCHES CASS WHO FALLS TO THE FLOOR AND STOPS MOVING.

ISHIM: So now... I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna cure you of your human weakness same way I cured my own–

ISHIM PRODUCES AN ANGEL BLADE.

ISHIM: – by cutting it out.

ISHIM WALKS TOWARD DEAN WHO BACKS UP TO REVEAL THE BLASTING ANGELS AWAY SIGIL. DEAN’S HAND HOVERS OVER THE SIGIL.

DEAN: Don't move.

ISHIM: Do it. You blast me away, you'll blast away every angel in the room. I'll survive. Castiel, on the other hand, he's hurt. He might live or he might just end up a bloody smear on the wall. Roll the dice.

DEAN BACKS OFF.

ISHIM: Yeah. That's what I thought.

LILY: Ishim! No.

ISHIM TURNS TO SEE LILY AND SAM BOTH ARMED WITH ANGEL BLADES.

ISHIM: Hello, my love.

LILY MOTIONS ISHIM FORWARD AS SAM RUNS TO DEAN.

SAM: Hey. Hey.

DEAN: I thought you were supposed to keep her out of this.

SAM: Yeah, I changed my mind.

LILY AND ISHIM FIGHT.

DEAN: Good call.

FIGHTING CONTINUES.

SAM: All right, Plan B. Come on.

ISHIM PUSHES LILY AWAY. SAM SLICES AT HIS SIDE WITH AN ANGEL BLADE.

ISHIM: Aah!

ISHIM PUNCHES SAM WHO FALLS BACK. DEAN JUMPS IN AND SLICES ISHIM ON THE LEG. ISHIM GRABS DEAN AND TOSSES HIM. ISHIM TURNS AND LOOKS AT LILY

ISHIM: It's over.

LILY: No.

LILY PULLS OFF HER EYE PATCH TO REVEAL ONE CLOUDED EYE.

LILY: I will never be powerless again.

SHE PUTS HER HAND UP AND HER EYE FLASHES. ISHIM IS PUSHED AGAINST THE WALL.


ISHIM: You can't hold me here forever.

HE FIGHTS AGAINST IT AND SLOWLY STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD. HE GETS CLOSE TO LILY AND RAISES THE ANGEL BLADE TO STRIKE. JUST AS HE BEGINS TO LUNGE FORWARD, CASTIEL STABS HIM IN THE BACK WITH AN ANGEL BLADE.

ISHIM: Aah!

ISHIM DROPS TO THE GROUND AND CASS FALLS TO HIS KNEES.

CASS: You held him for long enough.

ACT 6
INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH. ISHIM IS LAYING ON THE GROUND WITH LILY STANDING OVER HIM.

SAM: All right, so, uh... What now?

DEAN: He's dead. Are you done?

LILY: Revenge is all I've had for over a hundred years. It's what I am.

DEAN: Wrong answer. You're done.

CASS: Dean.

DEAN AND LILY LOOK AT CASS.

CASS: I'm sorry. I was wrong. And...while it's true that I didn't know we were killing an innocent, ignorance is no excuse.

CASS STANDS AND WALKS TOWARD LILY.

CASS: I truly can't imagine the depths of your loss. This was your child. I can't imagine the pain. So if you leave here and you find that you can't forgive me... I'll be waiting.

LILY: Thank you.

INTERIOR OF THE BUNKER. DEAN HANDS CASS A BEER.

DEAN: You earned it.

CASS: Well, this will do very little for me, but I-I appreciate the gesture.

DEAN: What Ishim said... You're not weak, Cass. You know that, right?

SAM: I mean, obviously, you've changed, but it's all been for the better, man.

DEAN: And you have been with us every step of this long, crazy thrill ride. And no matter how crazy it got, you never backed down.

SAM: And that takes real strength.

CASS: Thank you.

DEAN: Cass, I don't like how the whole Billie thing went down. Okay? I know you think you were doing the right thing. And I'm not mad. I'm worried. Because things like “cosmic consequences” have a habit of biting us in the ass.

CASS: I know they do. But I don't regret what I did, even if it costs me my life.

SAM: Don't say that, man.

DEAN: So what are you gonna do if you find Kelly and, uh, Lucifer Junior? It is a Nephilim, right?

CASS: Oh, no. It's more than that. An ordinary Nephilim is one of the most dangerous beings in all of creation. But one that's fathered by an archangel, the Devil himself? I...I can't imagine the power.

SAM: But, Cass, at the end of the day, it's a mom and her kid. I mean, do you – do you think you'll be able to...

CASS: There was a time when I wouldn't have hesitated. But now, I don't know.

DEAN: What are we gonna do?

CASS: Let's drink, and hope we can find a better way.
