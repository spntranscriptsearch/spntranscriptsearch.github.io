TEASER
[The episode opens up with an outside shot of a house with a car pulling into the garage. The tagline reads "Milton, Illinois." Inside, a man is eating popcorn in front of a television as his wife walks in the door with a bundle of flowers in her hand and a bag of groceries. She sets them down on the kitchen counter and sighs like she has had a hard day.]


HUSBAND

What's on the menu tonight?


WIFE

Meatloaf.


HUSBAND

Really? Again?


WIFE [slightly annoyed]

I wish you wouldn't say that. You know how hard I work all day, and yet you criticize me.


[The husband rolls his eyes as behind him the wife picks up a large candle holder. Without hesitation she smashes him in the face with it, twice.]


WIFE

So, yes. [Smash] We're having meatloaf.[Smash] With potatoes...[smash] and broccoli...[smash]...and lots of good things.


[Blood splatters on the television and the camera pans to a note from a child on the fridge which reads "Mrs. Young is the best."]


TITLE CARD


ACT ONE
[Scene opens in the Bunker. DEAN is sets a large, red book on the table and starts to leaf through it. SAM enters.]


SAM

Hey.


DEAN [barely glancing up]

Hey.


SAM

You catch any shut-eye last night?


DEAN

Nope.


SAM

Guess I'm driving, then.


DEAN

Driving where?


SAM

Caught wind of a case online. A 1st-grade teacher came home and killed her husband.


DEAN

Well, maybe she snapped. Ankle biters can do that to you.


SAM

Dude, she pounded him, into ground chuck.


DEAN [still reading out of the book and not really paying attention]

So, what are you thinking?


SAM

Best guess -- possession.


DEAN

Why don't you go?


[DEAN turns his back on SAM and walks over to a file folder and starts to look through it.]


SAM

Dean, look. I want to find Abaddon, too, but we've been combing through this stuff for days.


DEAN

Well, maybe we missed something.


SAM

And maybe there are better ways to spend our time than just spin our --


DEAN [shouts, interrupting his brother]

Maybe we don't have time!


SAM

What's up with you?


DEAN [pulls a paper out of the folder and starts to read it silently]

Nothing.


SAM [walking over to DEAN]

Yeah? See, because ever since you killed Magnus, you've been acting... sort of...obsessed.


DEAN [finally turning around to face SAM]

Well, maybe because I want an end to all this. Maybe because if we find Abaddon, then Crowley ponies up the First Blade, and we kill her and him both. So, what you call being "obsessed," I call doing my job.


SAM

Okay, um... I get it, Dean. I'm just checking in.


DEAN

I'm fine.


SAM [nods but looks unconvinced]

All right. Hit me up if you find anything.


[SAM leaves the room. DEAN closes his eyes and then opens them and pulls a large bottle of whiskey out of his bag. He takes a long drink.]


[SAM (dressed in FBI attire) is walking through the Milton, IL police station talking to the SHERIFF]


SAM

It says here in your report that you were the first on the scene?


SHERIFF

Yes, sir. I found Mrs. Young sitting next to her husband covered in his blood.


SAM

Now, was her husband abusive?


SHERIFF

Ric? Oh, no. Not at all. I mean, he could be a stubborn S.O.B., but can't we all?


SAM

Ah. Anything else, uh, weird that maybe you felt was too odd to include?


SHERIFF

Like?


SAM

Like, did you smell sulfur?


SHERIFF

Why would I smell sulfur?


SAM

Of course. Uh, thank you. What about Karen's eyes? You notice anything strange?


SHERIFF

Actually, agent, they, uh, pretty much looked like eyes.


[They round the corner into the cell block and the SHERIFF stops in his tracks.]


SHERIFF

Oh, lord.


[KAREN YOUNG has hung herself in her cell but not before she has wrote and drawn across the walls in her own blood.]


[Next scene the coroner is taking KAREN's body out of the station which the SHERIFF is talking to SAM]


SHERIFF

I don't get this. Karen and Ric were two of the most ordinary people you'd ever meet.


SAM

Did she go anywhere on the day of the murder?


SHERIFF

It was Saturday. Uh... A quick trip to the grocery store. That's about it.


[Scene changes to DEAN still pouring over letters, files, books and film scattered across the table in the Bunker. His cell phone rings and the caller ID says SAM is calling. DEAN picks it up and hesitates before answering. He finally does but puts it on speaker.]


DEAN

How's Mrs. Manson doing?


SAM

Dead. Hung herself in her cell.


DEAN

Lovely. The demon smoke out?


SAM

If it was a demon. I mean, there was no sulfur, no EMF anywhere. And everyone who saw her just before she gutted her husband said she was totally fine.


DEAN

What are you still doing there? This sounds like a case of the crazies to me.


SAM

Well, if nothing kicks up by morning, I'm out of here. How's the research going?


DEAN

It's going. All right. Well, uh...Good luck.


[DEAN hangs up on SAM. He sets his phone on the table and stares at his empty bottle of whiskey with far away eyes...we hear CAIN's voice as DEAN remembers.]


CAIN

I can give you the Mark, Dean, if it's what you truly want.


DEAN

Can I use it to kill that bitch?


CAIN

Yes. But you have to know with the Mark comes a great burden.


[There is a flashback and we see the Mark being transferred from CAIN's arm to DEAN's, then a shot of DEAN decapitating MAGNUS. After MAGNUS falls to the floor we see DEAN's right hand shaking with the power of the First Blade. Back in the bunker DEAN's left hand is grasping the table but shaking with the memory of the First Blade. DEAN suddenly jerk back to reality and lifts his still trembling hand to look at it. He picks up his phone and dials, but as it is ringing he changes his mind and hangs up. DEAN quickly grabs his coat and leaves.]


[Scene changes to a young man, BILLY, walking down the road in the middle of the night. He is on the phone.]


BILLY

Uh-huh.

Yep.

No. I know. I'm sorry.

No, I'll make it up to you.

Look, I'm trying to get there, babe, but I got into a fight with my mom.

[A van pulls up to the side of the ride after BILLY thumbs it for a ride]

Oh, I think I got a bite.

Yeah, a van is pulling up. Let me roll.

I love you. Bye.


[BILLY rushes to the passenger door and then smiles as he recognizes the driver]


Oh, hey! I didn't know this was your ride, Mr. Richie.


MR. RICHIE

Let's get you out of the cold.


BILLY [as he gets in]

Thanks. It's freezing out there.


[From a shot outside the van, BILLY starts to yell and there is a flash of blue light.]


BILLY

Hey, what -- what are you doing?! Get off me! No!


ACT TWO
[The scene opens in a diner.]


THE COOK

Order up. Here you go.


WATRESS

Thanks, R.J.


[The WAITRESS takes the plate and turns around and sets it in front of SAM.]


WAITRESS

Can I get you anything else, honey?


SAM

Uh, this is great. Thank you.


THE COOK

Order up.


[BILLY enters]


WAITRESS

Be with you in a minute, Bill.


[BILLY sits down at the counter and grabs mashed potatoes from the plate next to him and starts stuffing them into his mouth.]


WAITRESS [aghast]

Billy, what are you doing? Your mother raise you in a barn?


BILLY [shouting]

Don't talk to me like that!


SAM

Hey. Take it easy. She's working hard.


WAITRESS [approaching BILLY]

What's eating you?


BILLY [pushing a glass off the counter and shattering it on the floor]

You. My mom.

Him. [gesturing at SAM]


SAM

Buddy...Give it a rest.


[SAM and BILLY have a staredown until the WAITRESS gets his attention]


WAITRESS

Billy? Billy. I'm gonna call your mom, have her come fetch you.


BILLY

No, you're not.


[BILLY grabs a table knife from the counter and stabs it into the WAITRESS' hand, pinning it to the counter. She screams and SAM flies from his seat and quickly disarms BILLY and knocks him unconscious.]


[Back at the Milton Sheriff's Department, SAM is walking through the cell block with the sheriff. With BILLY, there are about 3 or 4 other people who are writing on the walls with their own blood, humming to themselves or banging their head against the cell door.]


SAM

So, tell me what's happening here.


SHERIFF

I was hoping you'd tell me. You're the one that mentioned weird.


SAM

Now, where did they all come from?


SHERIFF

Oh, they're all locals. Four of the straightest arrows you'd ever meet. Apparently, they've been acting like this for days.


SAM

Do they share anything in common? Church? School? Uh, book club?


SHERIFF

Not of my knowledge. Oh, I met the kid's girlfriend. She said he was hitching a ride when a van picked him up, and that's the last she heard of him. Whatever that's worth.


[The SHERIFF is called away and SAM walks back to BILLY's cell and shakes holy water on him. Nothing happens]


SAM

What are you, Billy?


BILLY

Clear.


SAM

Of?


BILLY

Everything.


SAM

Why are you doing this?


BILLY

You think there's a "why"? No. It's because I want to. And I can.


[SAM is sitting in the police station still reading through case files. He dials his phone and while it is ringing, the SHERIFF hands him some pictures.]


SHERIFF

Grocery store surveillance pics.


SAM

Great. Thank you.


[After about 5 rings, DEAN finally picks up. We can see he is drinking a beer at a bar.]


DEAN

Hey.


SAM

Well, that took forever.


DEAN

Uh, well, I'm working. You got anything?


SAM

Not sure. But, um, a handful of other people have started acting out, too.


DEAN

Acting out how?


SAM

Well, same as the woman -- aggressive, violent, impulsive.


DEAN

Sounds like you're in a Gold's gym.


SAM

Yeah. Except it's less steroid-induced, and more...basic instinct. It's like the littlest things can set them off.

[You can see SAM start to put the pieces together...]

Kind of like me.


DEAN

You?


SAM

Yeah, uh, soulless me. Remember that?


DEAN [snorts]

Yeah, how could I forget? But you weren't out of control like these people.


SAM

Yeah, well, maybe everyone has a different reaction to losing their soul.


DEAN

Possible. So, what? A crossroads demon making deals and taking people's souls?


SAM

No, I don't think so. I mean, it's not as if these people are winning the lotto.


DEAN

Okay. Uh, well, that was my best swing.


SAM

I hope not, Dean. I-I could really use your help down here.

Dean?


DEAN

Yeah, no, I -- I heard you. I just, uh...I'm getting close, Sam. I can't drop the ball on Abaddon right now.


SAM

All right. Be safe.


[DEAN hangs up and starts to drink his second beer. Suddenly CROWLEY appears in the booth behind him.]


CROWLEY

You're lying to Sam like he's your wife, which kind of makes me your mistress.


[SAM is studying the surveillance pictures from the grocery store. He notices that there is a van in the parking lot of the store with the words St. Bonaventure on the side. He then hears an older lady at the police desk talking to the officer on duty.]


LADY

Now, listen to me, young man. Those demons are back. I'm telling you, it's happening all over again.


OFFICER

Demons?


LADY

Yes! Demons. Are you deaf?


OFFICER

Yes, ma'am. You know what? We're gonna take care of those demons right away. Now, do you need a ride home or something?


LADY

Don't patronize me, you little turd.


[SAM walks up]


SAM

Hey, you know what? I can take it from here. Um, agent Leiter. [flashes his badge]

[SAM motions for her to join him at the table] Please.


[A few minutes later, SAM hands her a cup of warm tea.]


SAM

Here you are.


LADY

Thank you.


SAM

Sure. Now, why don't you tell me all about these demons, Ms. Wilkinson?


JULIA

Please, call me Julia. It's very simple, Agent. They...they came to Milton.


SAM

And?


JULIA [pausing]

I say "demons," and you don't bat an eye, when everyone else around here thinks I'm nuts on toast.


SAM

Maybe I'm just a bit more open-minded than most.


JULIA

Maybe. You're one of them, aren't you?


SAM

Sorry. One of who?


JULIA

Men of Letters.


[SAM is shocked]


They came here in 1958.


SAM

Men of Letters... came here?


JULIA

Oh, yes. It was different then. I was different. They were a lovely couple.


[The scene changes to a young nun who is dusting a hallway table. The tagline reads "1958." There is a knock on the door. A voice calls from the other room]


Sister Julia, please answer the door.


JULIA

Yes, Mother Superior.


[She answers the door and on the doorstep stands HENRY WINCHESTER and JOSIE SANDS. HENRY hands a letter to JULIA.]


HENRY

Good evening, sister. We're here from the Office of the Inquisition.


ACT THREE
[Scene opens in the bar with DEAN raking up a queue of pool balls on the pool table with his arms. CROWLEY stands by.]


DEAN

What do you want?


CROWLEY

You tell me, romeo. You rang. Let me guess -- you butt-dialed me?


DEAN

Whatever the hell that is. Either way, we done here?


CROWLEY

Actually, long as I'm here, last time we chitchatted, we agreed that you were gonna line up Carrot Top.


DEAN [putting the balls in a triangle and arranges them in the correct order. He pushes them up the table and takes the triangle off]

Yep, well...I'm on it.


CROWLEY

Unless Abaddon likes 10-cent wings, stale beer, and the clap, I doubt that she's here.


DEAN

Go to hell.


CROWLEY

Oh, if only. What's going on with you, huh? You call me, you hang up. You want Abaddon, you don't want Abaddon. You want the Blade, you don't want the Blade. If I didn't know you any better, I'd say you're stalling.


[DEAN sights up his pool stick and breaks.]


CROWLEY

Just between us girls, how did you feel when you sunk the First Blade into Magnus' head?


DEAN [looking up from sighting his next shot]

Not half as good as I'm gonna feel when it's yours.


CROWLEY

Love it when you talk dirty. You know what I think? I think you felt powerful...Virile...And afraid.


DEAN [scoffs]

Afraid?


CROWLEY

Don't scam a scam artist, darling. You're stalling 'cause you're scared.


[Back at the police station, JULIA continues her story to SAM.]


JULIA

They gave false names, but later I learned that the man's name was Henry.


SAM

Henry Winchester?


JULIA

Never got a last name.


SAM

Okay, um, and the woman?


JULIA

Josie. Did you know them?


SAM

Yes, uh... Sort of. It's complicated.


JULIA

I'm an ex-nun, sweetie. Complicated is my middle name.


SAM

Now, what were they here to investigate?


JULIA

Sister Mary Catherine. She killed two people before jumping from the bell tower. So I took them to see Mother Superior and sister Agnes.


[Scene changes back to 1958 and the MOTHER SUPERIOR is reading the letter painstakingly slow.]


HENRY

Time is of the essence, Mother...Superior. The cardinal is meeting with the holy father first thing in the morning,

and he wants a report.


[MOTHER SUPERIOR finally finishes the letter and hands it to SISTER AGNES.]


SISTER AGNES

Our beloved abbey is open to you, Father. Sister Julia here will be your guide.


[They step out into the hall]


JULIA

Where would you like to begin?


JOSIE

Sister Mary Catherine's sleeping quarters, please.


[JULIA looks to HENRY for the answer. He uncomfortably repeats JOSIE'S words.]


HENRY

Sister Mary Catherine's room it is.


JOSIE [aside to HENRY as they climb the stairs]

I hate nuns.


HENRY

Why, because she answered me and not you?


JOSIE

No, because I went to Catholic school and I have a lot of pent-up anger.


HENRY

We have no time for such pettiness.


JOSIE

What's got your boxers all in a bundle?


HENRY

This. Why are we out in the field?


JOSIE

It's called learning on the job. And you know damn well this is the last assignment before we are full members.


HENRY

Therein lies the problem. As our initiation grows closer, I... I worry that this might be a selfish endeavor on my part.


JOSIE

Selfish. How?


HENRY

If anything were to happen to me, what of John? Millie?


JOSIE

They'd be proud to know that you answered the call.


HENRY

No. My wife would be a widow, and my son fatherless. I don't expect you to understand. You don't have a fam--

[he pauses]

I'm sorry, Josie. I didn't mean it that way.


JOSIE

I know, Henry. You're a good man. Millie is lucky to have you.


[They reach an open door]


JULIA

Here we are. The...blood wouldn't come off.


[JOSIE and HENRY inspect the room. There is random drawing and writing on the walls.]


HENRY

So, we're assuming demonic possession here, correct?


JOSIE

Or a linguist gone mad.


HENRY

It looks ancient. Zapoqra or Sanskrit?


JOSIE

No. It -- it's pre-Enochian. A crest of some sort. Kni-- "Knights of Hell"? What is that?


HENRY

Trouble.


[Back at the police station]


SAM

Knights of Hell? What were they doing there?


JOSIE

I'm not sure of anything I saw that night. We couldn't leave our room after 10:00. Mother Superior forbade it.


[Back in 1958, JULIA is in bed but hears footsteps in the hall. She goes to investigate and sees the MOTHER SUPERIOR dragging a struggle girl down the steps. When the MOTHER looks up her eyes are black. JULIA gasps in fright and goes to flee but SISTER AGNES is there and knocks her out.]


JULIA

I woke up in a dark place, tied to a chair. There were others. They were taken.


[SISTER AGNES strides in and unties one of the girls and drags her out the door. There is a flash of blue light. One by one each person is taken out, until only JULIA is left]


JULIA

I was so scared. I prayed and prayed, but God didn't answer my prayers. Henry and Josie did.


[HENRY and JOSIE burst into the barn where JULIA is being untied to be taken out. They start to exorcise the demons.]


JOSIE

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus...


HENRY

Ergo, Draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica, adjuramus te. Et secta diabolica!


JOSIE

Ut ecclesiam tuam secura tibi facias libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos!


[Both demons smoke out of the nuns bodies. HENRY and JOSIE exchange relieved glances. But then the MOTHER SUPERIOR enters with her eyes black]


HENRY

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio!


[The MOTHER SUPERIOR flicks HENRY into the wall and he falls unconcious.]


JOSIE

Henry!


MOTHER SUPERIOR

You hunters are always sticking your noses in where they don't belong.


JOSIE

Hunters? Please.


MOTHER SUPERIOR

Then what are you? Quickly, dear, before this one pays for your stubborness!


JOSIE

We are preceptors... Beholders, chroniclers of all that which man does not understand.


MOTHER SUPERIOR

A woman amongst the Men of Letters?


JOSIE

Yes.


MOTHER SUPERIOR

Well, ain't that a blast.


JOSIE

You do know what we're capable of, demon?


MOTHER SUPERIOR

Yes. I know what you think you're capable of, but perhaps I should see for myself.


JOSIE

Wait. What are you doing?


MOTHER SUPERIOR

I'm trading up from this bag of bones to Mr. Dreamy here. [motioning to HENRY] Then I can study your kind real close.


JOSIE

Don't, or I'll --


MOTHER SURERIOR

or what?


JOSIE

Take me, not him.


MOTHER SUPERIOR

You're joking.


JOSIE

I could be more useful to you. People underestimate a woman.


MOTHER SUPERIOR [considering JOSIE]

No. That's not it. You love him. He loves you, too, you know. Like a sister.


JOSIE

Please... Spare him. Take me. You have my permission.


MOTHER SUPERIOR

You've been very entertaining, my dear. But I don't need your permission. Abaddon takes what she wants. And right now, she wants everything.


[ABADDON smokes out of MOTHER SUPERIOR's body and into JOSIE.]


SISTER AGNES

You're going to study the Men of Letters?


ABADDON

For a moment. And then I'll destroy them.


SISTER AGNES

And what of all this?


ABADDON

Keep it going until I return. Now play dead.


[SISTER AGNES collapses on the ground and ABADDON in JOSIE's body rushes for HENRY]


ABADDON/JOSIE

Henry! Are you okay?


[HENRY regains consciousness]


ABADDON/JOSIE

We did it. We stopped the demons.


[Back in the police station, JULIA finishes her story]


SAM

Abaddon. Did you ever see exactly what she was doing down there?


JULIA

No, but whatever it was she was doing at St. Bonaventure, it seems to be happening again.


SAM

The convent's name was St. Bonaventure?


JULIA

Yes.


SAM

Where is it?


JULIA

On the outskirts of town. It's been closed for years.


[Scene changes back to CROWLEY and DEAN in the bar. They are sitting at the bar and CROWLEY whistles for a drink.]


CROWLEY

I love this. I really do. Couple of cold ones, a kind jukebox... Good and evil, bro-in down.


DEAN

Shut your pie hole, Crowley.


CROWLEY

Yeah, you said that already. Look, I merely suggested you might be a bit scared.


DEAN

Yeah. No, I heard you the first time. You still don't know what the hell you're talking about.


CROWLEY

I know that Cain gave you his Mark for a reason. And I know that rather than embracing it, rather than looking at it as the gift that it is, you're sulking like you lost your knuffle bunny. Why are you fighting what you really are?


DEAN

I'm a hunter.


CROWLEY

Who's a chip off the old Mark of Cain.


DEAN

No. When I kill, I kill for a reason. I'm nothing like Cain.


CROWLEY

Nothing like -- who are you talking to? I know you're not talking to me.


DEAN

Eat me.


CROWLEY

I saw you. I saw the two of you together. Nothing like Cain? What's in that bottle? Delusion? I'm really starting to worry about you, Dean.


DEAN

Yeah, well, why don't you worry about yourself?


CROWLEY

I will. 'Cause like it or not, we're in this together. Your problems, my problems... Our problems.


[CROWLEY gets up and walks toward the back]


DEAN

Where you going now?


CROWLEY

I'm going to go water the lily. Care to cross streams?

[DEAN rolls he eyes]

So serious.


[DEAN suddenly grasps his right forearm where the Mark is. MAGNUS' voice echoes in his head]


MAGNUS

That's it. Good. You'll get used to the feelings, even welcome them.


[DEAN continues to hold his arm as he looks toward where CROWLEY disappeared. Suddenly he notices a guy further down the bar how is holding a rosary and looking like he is prepping for a fight. He removes a knife from his belt and goes after CROWLEY.


ACT FOUR
[Before JAKE can get to the bathroom door, DEAN is there.]


DEAN

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Easy. I know what you're thinking.


GUY (JAKE)

I'm thinking I'd like to take a leak, so move.


DEAN

I'm Dean Winchester. And I know a hunter when I see one. You don't want to do what you're about to do.


JAKE

And why's that?


DEAN

Because you're packing a knife to a demon fight, and you don't stand a chance.


JAKE

Then I'll go down swinging.


DEAN

Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me. Any other day, I'd be right there with you, brother. I would, okay? But you got to trust me on this one.


JAKE

Or you could grow a pair and come with.


DEAN

You ever taken on a demon before? Yeah. Well, trust me when I say that when he's done with you, he's gonna go after your family. He's gonna go after your friends. Hell, he'll go after your prom date. So, if you want to do that, if you want to damn anyone and everyone you've ever loved in the slightest chance that you could win, then by all means, pal. You go right ahead.


JAKE

I got a kid sister. She don't deserve that.


DEAN

What's your name?


JAKE

Jake.


DEAN

Good to meet you, Jake.


JAKE

Thanks.


DEAN

I'll see you around.


[JAKE leaves and DEAN bangs on the bathroom door]


DEAN

Come on. We got to go.


[Scene changes to SAM pulling up to the ruins of the St. Bonaventure convent in the IMPALA.]


[Back outside the bar (which is called The Milton) DEAN waits for CROWLEY. CROWLEY walks out the front door.]


DEAN

Demons don't take leaks. Next time you want to shoot up, why don't you find a better excuse?


CROWLEY

Guilty as charged.


DEAN

What happened? I thought you were cleaning up your act.


CROWLEY

Well, I was going to, but then after very little soul-searching, I decided to embrace my addiction. What about you? Takes a junkie to know a junkie. You just want to touch that precious again, don't you?


DEAN

I want to kill Abaddon. That's what I want. So, whatever happens with the Blade, I can't worry about that.


CROWLEY

Sure. Whatever you got to tell yourself so you can sleep better at night.


DEAN

Look, what I want, what I fear, none of that means squat. Because this is the one chance that we have to kill Abaddon. So, I'm all in, no matter what the consequences.


CROWLEY

So the plan remains the same?


DEAN

I find her, you bring the Blade.


CROWLEY

It's a date.


[DEAN walks off down the street with his back to CROWLEY. JAKE walks up.]


JAKE

For a second there, I thought he made me.


CROWLEY

He has other things on his mind.


JAKE

But he did do exactly what you said he would. He saved you.


CROWLEY

Of course he saved me. We're besties. And now he's ready.


[Back at St. Bonaventure, SAM is searching the grounds. He opens a door into a hallway and searches along it. He discovers stairs and walks down. There, on a shelf, are five bottles full of brilliant blue light. Before SAM can pick one up he is attacked by MR. RICHIE who he quickly kills with the demon knife. He is then thrown back into a pile of boxes by SISTER AGNES.]


SISTER AGNES

Souls are a very precious and fragile thing. Break one of those, and them little buggers fly right back home. We can't have that, now can we?


SAM [gasping in pain and trying to stand up again]

So, after all these years, you're still doing Abaddon's dirty work, huh, Agnes?


SISTER AGNES

Would you believe it's gotten even dirtier? Used to be folks believed in the church. Heck, the way they would come strolling in here, looking for God. It was like fish in a barrel, really. But times change. You can blame your perverts for that. Now I'm riding shotgun in some smelly van with a handyman and tricking any half-wit I can lay my hands on. But it's worth it.


SAM

Because... Stealing souls is so noble.


SISTER AGNES

Stealing souls is winning!


SAM

Winning what?


SISTER ANGES

Hell's crown, nimrod. You think Abaddon is just gonna sit there while those pantywaisted demons refuse to pick a side?! And so she made a plan -- if you can't convince 'em, make 'em.


SAM

She's turning souls into demons?


SISTER AGNES

Hmm. A demon army, unbeatable, loyal only to her.


SAM

Well, uh... At this rate... Should only take a couple million years. Have fun with that.


SISTER AGNES

You think I'm the only one doing this? We have factories spread throughout. Worry not, though. Victory is nigh. And we'd like you to be on our team. Recruitment is easy. I just have to rip your soul out of your body.


[SAM gives he an 'over my dead body' look and starts to exorcise her]


SAM

Regna terrae, cantate deo --


SISTER ANGES [rushing to SAM and starting to choke him with her hands. He gasps to a stop]

Please!


[But SAM pulls his phone out of his pocket and starts to play a recorded exorcism. He throws it from them onto the floor.]


RECORDED VOICE

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica. Ergo, Draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica, adjuramus te. Cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque aeternae perditionis venenum propinare. Vade, satana, inventor et Magister omnis fallaciae, hostis humanae salutis. Humiliare sub potenti manu dei --


[SISTER AGNES falls to the floor and crawls toward the phone trying to get there before the exorcism is complete. She gets there and smashes SAM's phone to bits. But before she can recover, SAM stabs her with the demon knife. She flashes and dies. SAM gently releases all the souls in the glass jars and they all fly back to the people sitting in the cells. They all look around shocked at where they are.]

ACT FIVE
[SAM and JULIA walk back to her car in front of the police station]


SAM

You know, um, can I ask you something?


JULIA

If it's for a date, I'm sorry. I never see anyone under 65. Too much drama.

[SAM chuckles and JULIA smiles]

Spit it out.


SAM

After witnessing what you did, why didn't you warn Henry about Abaddon?


JULIA

I became a nun because I wanted to help people. Make a difference. But they never prepare you. They never tell you how to act in the face of true evil.


[Back in 1958, HENRY and ABADDON/JOSIE say goodbye to the nuns]


HENRY

Thank you, sister.


ABADDON/JOSIE

For the safety of all those involved, it's important that we keep what happened here today...quiet.


YOUNG JULIA

Of course.


OLDER JULIA

Soon after, I left the order.


SAM

Why?


JULIA [getting choked up]

Because I was ashamed. I had betrayed our flock, God, myself. It was and still is my greatest shame.


SAM

Well, what you shared with me saved lives. And I couldn't have done that without you. Take care.


JULIA

You too, Sam.


[In 1958, HENRY and ABADDON/JOSIE get in their car.]


ABADDON/JOSIE

You okay, Henry?


HENRY

Better. We saved lives today. We made a difference.


ABADDON/JOSIE

Hmm.


HENRY

This -- our work... It's a noble calling, isn't it? I mean, yes, there's risk, but, gosh. I feel the fool for doubting it for even a second.


ABADDON/JOSIE

Hmm.


HENRY

And you, Josie?


ABADDON/JOSIE

Me? Well, I feel like a whole new person.


[Scene changes back to DEAN sitting at the table in the bunker. SAM enters]


SAM

Still plugging away?


DEAN

Like a dog with a bone. You?


[SAM grabs some files from DEAN's table and goes to sit at the other table. He starts to read the top file.]


SAM

You were right.


DEAN

About what?


SAM

Finding Abaddon ASAP. She's mining souls.


DEAN [very concerned]

Why?


SAM

To create an army.
