TEASER
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A man, possessed by a demon, sits tied to a chair in the center of a Devil's Trap. SAM is in front of him, interrogating; RUBY stands nearby.

SAM
Where's Lilith?

MAN
Kiss my ass.

His eyes goes black. SAM smiles at that comment.

SAM
I'd watch myself if I were you.

MAN
Why? Huh? Because you're Sam Winchester, Mr. Big Hero? And yet here you are, slutting around with some demon. Real hero.

SAM
Shut your mouth.

MAN
Tell me about those months without your brother. About all the things you and this demon bitch do in the dark.

RUBY looks over at SAM.

MAN
Huh? Tell me, hero.

SAM can't control his anger and begins to force the demon out of the man, like we saw in "LAZARUS RISING". The demon smoke burns through the floor, and SAM breathes, trying to get himself under control. RUBY looks down on the floor where the demon burned through and a little smile plays on her lips. She looks over at SAM, and they exchange a look and SAM gets a little smile as well. We then see DEAN in the window behind SAM, witnessing everything SAM just did.

ACT ONE
INT. 425 WATERMAN - NIGHT

The man is unconcious and SAM touches neck to check if he has a pulse, which he does. He smiles up at RUBY.

RUBY
How'd it feel?

SAM
Good. No more headaches.

He begins to untie the man.

RUBY
None? That's good.

The man begins to wake up.

SAM
Hey, hey. I got you. It's all right.

He helps the man out of his chair and begins walking him towards the door, when DEAN opens it. SAM stops in his tracks. DEAN looks very angry.

DEAN
So... Anything you wanna tell me, Sam?

SAM looks innocent and RUBY stands behind him, just watching DEAN. DEAN walks towards him as he talks.

SAM
Dean, hold on, okay? Just let me-

DEAN
You gonna say, "let me explain"? You're gonna explain this? How about this? Why don't you start with who she is, and what the hell is she doing here?

DEAN looks at him hard, SAM turns back and looks at RUBY who looks completely calm, and even smiles as she responds to DEAN.

RUBY
It's good to see you again, Dean.

DEAN
Ruby?

She smiles a little, and DEAN looks at SAM.

DEAN
Is that Ruby?

SAM doesn't respond and DEAN looks over at RUBY again, who's smile is fading. After moment, DEAN grabs hold of her and shoves her up against the wall. He pulls out her knife and as he's about to strike, SAM grabs his hand.

SAM
Don't!

They struggle for the knife. SAM gets it out of DEAN's hand into his own, just as DEAN throws him up against the wall. RUBY grabs DEAN and pins him up against the wall he had her against seconds earlier.

SAM
Ruby! Stop it!

She just stares into DEAN's eyes and she keeps a chokehold with her right hand, and he stares right back, angry. Finally she lets go and he rises up to his full height. He looks over at SAM and then back at RUBY.

DEAN
Well, aren't you an obedient little bitch?

She doesn't respond but it's clear, she wants to attack him again.

SAM
Ruby.

She stares at DEAN for a few more moments, and then looks over at SAM.

SAM
Ruby, he's hurt.

He indicates the man who was possessed earlier.

SAM
Go.

She gives DEAN one more look and then turns and walks over to the man, and as DEAN watches her, she puts the mans arm over her shoulder, ready to take him out.

DEAN
Where the hell do you think you're going?

RUBY
The ER... unless you want to go another round first.

DEAN doesn't say anything and she walks out with the man. DEAN turns to look at SAM, who's watching him.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN walks to the door he came in through, leaving SAM behind.

SAM
Dean!

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM is sitting at the table, reading a book. We hear the IMPALA pull up outside and DEAN enters a few moments later. He doesn't look at SAM, he just walks right into the room. SAM gets out of his chair the minute DEAN enters. DEAN grabs his bag and begins to pack up his stuff. SAM walks over to him.

SAM
Dean, what are you doing?

DEAN just ignores him and continues packing.

SAM
What, are you, are you leaving?

DEAN
You don't need me. You and Ruby go fight demons.

DEAN grabs his bag and starts for the door. SAM stands in the way so DEAN has to go around him.

SAM
Hold on. Dean, come on, man.

DEAN turns around and punches him in the face with his right hand. SAM whirles around by the force. DEAN just watches him as he turns back around to DEAN.

SAM
You satisfied?

DEAN hits him again, and then throws his bag on the floor. SAM touches his lip, which is bleeding.

SAM
I guess not.

DEAN
Do you even know how far off the reservation you've gone? How far from normal? From human?

SAM
I'm just exorcising demons.

DEAN (yelling)
With your mind!
(calmer)
What else can you do?

SAM
I can send them back to hell. It only works with demons, and that's it.

DEAN grabs hold of him and pushes him backwards, walking with the force.

DEAN
What else can you do?!

SAM
I told you!

SAM pushes his hand away, and they stop.

DEAN
And I have every reason in the world to believe that.

He begins to walk away from SAM.

SAM
Look, I should have said something.

DEAN stops, his back still to SAM.

SAM
I'm sorry, Dean. I am. But try to see the other side here.

DEAN turns around and faces him.

DEAN
The other side?

SAM
I'm pulling demons out of innocent people.

DEAN
Use the knife!

SAM
The knife kills the victim! What I do, most of them survive! Look, I've saved more people in the last five months than we save in a year.

DEAN
That what Ruby want you to think? Huh? Kind of like the way she tricked you into using your powers?

He shakes his head, sad.

DEAN
Slippery slope, brother. Just wait and see. Because it's gonna get darker and darker, and God knows where it ends.

SAM
I'm not gonna let it go too far.

DEAN smiles at that, walks over to the wall and hits the lamp on the side table, making it crash and fly. DEAN looks angry again.

DEAN
It's already gone too far, Sam. If I didn't you know... I would wanna hunt you.

SAM's eyes are tearful, and he nods at that, looking down.

DEAN
And so would other hunters.

SAM looks up at him.

SAM
You were gone. I was here. I had to keep on fighting without you. And what I'm doing... It works.

DEAN
Well, tell me. If it's so terrific... then why'd you lie about it to me?

SAM looks down with that.

DEAN
Why did an angel tell me to stop you?

SAM looks up, surprised.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Cas said that if I don't stop you, he will. See what that means, Sam? That means that God doesn't want you doing this. So, are you just gonna stand there and tell me everything is all good?

With tearful eyes, they exchange a look and then SAM looks down. The silence is broken by SAM's phone ringing, DEAN flinches at the sound. SAM answers it.

SAM
Hello?

He pinches the bridge of his nose, trying to collect himself.

SAM
Hey, Travis. Yeah, hey.
(...)
Uh..
(...)
It's good to hear your voice, too, yeah. Um, look, it's not a really good time right now. It's-
(...)
Yeah, okay. Uh, well, just give me the details, and, uh..
(...)
Carthage, Missouri.

DEAN watches SAM as he walks over to the bedside table and writes down the location.

SAM
Looking for Jack Montgomery.

He puts down the pen and ends the phonecall. Breathing deeply, he looks over at DEAN.

EXT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE - EVENING

SUBTITLE
Carthage, Missouri

The camera moves around a car on the street and zooms in on the front door.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

We open to a closeup on a man, JACK, chewing, the camera focused on his mouth. He's eating fast and stuffing his mouth. The camera pans out and we see he's completely focused on eating. He suddenly looks over at the person next to him, pausing mid-chew. His wife, MICHELLE, is staring at him and not eating.

MICHELLE
Jack, are you stoned?

He answers her with his mouth full.

JACK
What? It's good, I'm starving. Is there- is there dessert?

He looks over at her questioningly while cutting up another bite.

MICHELLE
It just so happens.

Smiling, she gets up and leaves the table. JACK grabs the bowl of mashed potatoes and tilts it over his plate, to get all of it out onto it. He looks over at his wife's plate, where there's still a piece of meat left.

JACK
Hey, babe?

She's almost out of the room when he stops and looks back at him.

MICHELLE
Mhmm?

JACK
Are you gonna finish your steak?

MICHELLE
You're kidding, right? You've had two already.

JACK
I don't know, I'm just... hungry.

He puts his knife in the middle of her steak and brings it over to his own plate.

MICHELLE
Or you have tapeworm.

JACK
Please. I never felt better.

He goes back to eating.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE; BATHROOM

JACK is in the bathroom, getting ready for bed. He's only dressed in his boxers and the camera is angled from behind so we see parts of his back and then his front in the mirror. He starts brushing his teeth. Suddenly we hear a crack and JACK's knees buckles and he grunts with pain, supporting himself on the facet. After few seconds another crunching crack can be heard and he falls lower, hanging on the facet now. We hear the sound again, and we see his spine potrude on his back for a second. He's down on his knees now, still holding on to the facet, screaming of pain. The crunchy sound can be heard a few more times and again we see his spine beneath his skin. JACK pants, and suddenly it seems it stops, and he slowly rises, looking at himself in the mirror. He turns his back to it and moves his right hand to the back, looking at it but there's no sign of what just happened.


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The IMPALA zooms down the road.

INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

DEAN is behind the wheels and it seems they've been driving under silence for a while after DEAN has told SAM about what he found out in the past about their mom and family (episode "IN THE BEGINNING").

SAM I can't believe it. Mom, a hunter?

DEAN
I wouldn't have believed it either if I hadn't seen it myself. That woman could kick some ass. I mean, she almost took me down.

SAM How'd she look? I mean... was she happy?

DEAN
Yeah, she was awesome. Funny and smart. So hopeful.

He looks over at SAM for moment and then back on the road.

DEAN
Dad, too. Until of course...

SAM sighs.

DEAN
What?

SAM looks out his window.

SAM
Nothing.

After a moment he turns back to DEAN.

SAM
It's just, our parents. And now we find out our grandparents too? Our whole family murdered and for what? So Yellow Eyes could get in my nursery and bleed in my mouth?

DEAN goes a bit "huh..?" over that last statement, thinking about what he's told SAM about the past. He looks over at SAM.

DEAN
Sam, I never said anything about demon blood.

SAM looks guilty.

DEAN
You knew about that?

SAM still doesn't look at DEAN.

SAM
Yeah, for about a year.

DEAN looks out through the window again, eyes on the road.

DEAN
A whole year?

SAM
I should have told you. I'm sorry.

DEAN
You've been saying that a lot lately, Sam. But whatever. You don't want to tell me, you don't have to. It's fine.

SAM
Dean.

SAM looks over at DEAN, who's focusing on the road.

SAM
Whatever.

SAM sighs.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

JACK comes down the stairs and heads out into the kitchen. He calls out to his wife.

JACK
Hey, babe. When's dinner?

MICHELLE (V.O)v 45 minutes.

He walks over to the fridge, and opens it, looking for something to eat.

JACK
I'm starving!

MICHELLE (V.O)
Jack, a delicious, unmicrowaved, non-takeout, homemade meal is coming.

INT. IMPALA

We see JACK by the fridge through binoculars. He takes out a beer.

DEAN (V.O)
Are you sure that's him?

We now see DEAN holding the binoculars, looking at the house, watching JACK.

SAM
Only Jack Montgomery in town.

DEAN
And we're looking for...

SAM
Travis said to keep an eye out for anything weird.

DEAN
Weird?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Alright, well, yeah, I've seen big weird, little weird, weird with crazy on top. But this guy? I mean, come on, this guy's boring.

SAM
I don't know, Dean. Travis seemed pretty sure.

He takes up a pair of binoculars of his own.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

JACK is leaning on the island in the kitchen, looking thoughtful. He takes another swig of his beer, and then opens the fridge again. He grabs a leftover chicken, and starts eating, not bothering with platers or utensiles. He begins to eat frantically, like he's not gotten food in days. He throws the finished chicken aside and grabs a pack of uncooked meat and opens it up and starts eating the raw meat, throwing looks over his shoulder for his wife.

MICHELLE (V.O)
Honey?

JACK stops eating when he hears her voice.

INT. IMPALA

We see through the binoculars again. We then cut to a pan over the boys, who both watched this foodcraze happen. They're wearing matching disgusted looks on their faces.

SAM
I'd say that qualifies as weird.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
INT. MOTELROOM

DEAN and SAM comes through the door, and stops as they've just entered, seeing something in their room. A smile comes on DEAN's lips.

SAM
Travis.

We see TRAVIS sitting by the table, beer in hand.

DEAN
See, Sam. Told you we should have hid the beer.

TRAVIS gets up and with a smile he walks towards the boys as they walk towards him.

TRAVIS
Smartass. Get over here.

He laughs and he and DEAN hug.

TRAVIS
Ahh, good to see you.

DEAN
You too.

They break and TRAVIS and SAM hug as well.

TRAVIS
Good to see you.

SAM
You too, Travis.

They break.

TRAVIS
Man, you got tall, kid.

They laugh at that comment.

TRAVIS
How long has it been?

SAM
Ah, gotta be 10 years.

TRAVIS
You still a.. oh, what was it... a mathlete?

SAM scoffs a little.

SAM
No.

DEAN
Yep, sure is.

TRAVIS
Been too long, boys. I mean, look at you. Grown men. John would have been damn proud of you. Sticking together like this.

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, we're as thick as thieves.

DEAN looks at SAM, who's smile is disappearing with DEAN's words.

DEAN
Nothing more important than family.

TRAVIS walks over to the table, as DEAN follows, ignoring SAM.

TRAVIS
Sorry I'm late for the dance.

They sit down at the table, SAM sits down on the bed next to DEAN, across from TRAVIS.

TRAVIS
Thanks for helping out an old man. I'm a little, uh, shorthanded.

He indicates his right hand and arm, which is covered in a cast. They laugh at that.

TRAVIS
So, you track down Montgomery?

SAM
Yeah, we found him at his home.

TRAVIS
And?

DEAN
Well, he had a hell of a case of the munchies, topped off with a burger he forgot to cook.

TRAVIS
That's him alright.

DEAN
What's him?

TRAVIS
Boys, we got a rougarou on our hands.

DEAN
A rougarou?

He looks over at SAM for a second.

DEAN
Is that made up?

He looks back at TRAVIS before SAM can answer.

DEAN
That sounds made up.

TRAVIS
They're mean, nasty little suckers. Rotted teeth, wormy skin, the works.

DEAN
Well, that ain't this guy. I mean, he was wearing a cellphone on his belt.

TRAVIS
He'll turn ugly soon enough. They start out human, for all intents and purposes.

SAM
So, what? They go through some kind of metamorphosis?

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE; KITCHEN

MICHELLE is standing in the kitchen, cutting vegetables.

TRAVIS (V.O)
Yep, like a maggot turning into a bull fly.

JACK comes into the kitchen and opens the fridge. There's a new package of meat, which JACK spots right away while he's sniffing the air like a dog. Suddenly MICHELLE cuts her hand, badly. She cries out in pain and JACK turns around. Her hand is bleeding, which JACK notices.

TRAVIS (V.O)
But most of all-

INT. MOTELROOM

TRAVIS
-they're hungry.

DEAN
Hungry for what?

TRAVIS
At first, for everything, but then... for long pig.

SAM exhales at that, understanding what TRAVIS means. DEAN looks confused, not understanding the term "long pig".

DEAN
Long pig?

SAM
He means human flesh.

DEAN
And that is my word of the day.

TRAVIS
Hunger grows in,-

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

JACK is frozen in place, watching his wife.

TRAVIS (V.O)
-till they can't fight it. Till they got to take themselves a big, juicy chomp, and then it happens.

We see MICHELLE pouring water on her finger, blood running.

INT. MOTELROOM

SAM
What happens?

TRAVIS
They transform completely and fast.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

MICHELLE turns the water off and grabs a dishtowel next to her on the counter.

MICHELLE
I think I need stitches.

JACK is sweaty but he doesn't move.

JACK
I got to go.

MICHELLE
What?

JACK
I got to get out of here.

He hurries out of the kitchen. MICHELLE calls after him, confused.

MICHELLE
Where are you going? Jack?

We hear the front door open and close as JACK runs out.

INT. MOTELROOM

TRAVIS
One bite's all it takes. Eyes, teeth, skin; all turns. No going back either. They feed once, they're a monster forever. And our man Jack's headed there on a bullet train.

DEAN
Well, how'd you find this guy if he's a walking, talking human?

TRAVIS
Lets just say it runs in his family.

SAM
You mean, uh...

TRAVIS
Killed his daddy back in '78. Son of a bitch mangled 8 bodies before I put him down. Guy used to be a dentist. Cadillac, trophy wife... Little did I know, pregnant trophy wife. She put the boy up for adoption. By the time I found out, he was long gone, lost in the system.

SAM
You mean to tell me you couldn't find someone?

TRAVIS sighs.

TRAVIS
I'm not sure I wanted to. The idea of hunting down some poor kid... I don't think I'd have the heart. No. I wanted to wait, make damn sure I had the right man. Apparently, I do.

He takes a swig of the beer.

INT. BAR

JACK is sitting by the bar and he grabs a handfull och peanuts and shoves them in his mouth, staring in front of him. He's sweaty and doesn't look all that great. We get a flash of bloodstream in a body, MICHELLE's cut finger, the bloodstream again, MICHELLE's finger and then JACK's eye, mouth and other eye. We see the bloodstream and MICHELLE's finger again, and then JACK shoving another handfull of peanuts in his mouth, chewing frantically. He downs his full glas of whiskey (?) in one gulp.

JACK
One more, please.

He puts down the glass. The bartender comes over and refills it.

JACK
Can I get some more peanuts?

JACK grabs the glass to drink again but notices something in the mirror behind the bar. He brings the glass down again and we now get a shot of the mirror, where JACK is staring at himself. He's breathing deeply, like he's been running.

MAN
Come on. What are you drinking? It's my treat.

JACK looks over to his right where a beautiful woman is sitting by the bar and a not so beautiful man is crowding her, doing a very lousy job at hitting at her. She looks very uncomfortable.

WOMAN
No, thank you.

MAN
Oh, don't be like that. Have a drink with me.

WOMAN
I'm waiting for someone.

MAN
Okay, well uh, where is he?

JACK
Hey, douche bag.

The MAN and the WOMAN looks over at JACK.

JACK
She doesn't want to talk to you.

MAN
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

JACK gets of his chair and begins walking towards them.

JACK
I said... She doesn't want to talk to you.

The MAN walks around the WOMAN to meet JACK. The WOMAN looks even more uncomfortable.

JACK
You fat... sweaty... dick.

He stops right in front of the man, and they stand face to face.

JACK
Now leave her alone.

MAN
You uh.. seriously wanna do this, guy?

JACK
You know, I really think I do.

The MAN brings up his right fist and goes to punch JACK but JACK catches his fist in his hand and squeezes it so we can hear bones crunching in the MAN's hand. The MAN screams with pain and the WOMAN screams out of fear. JACK suddenly snaps out of it and releases the MAN's hand and runs away.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. MOTELROOM

DEAN and TRAVIS is by the table, fixing gas cans (looks like tiny fire-extinguishers) for use.

DEAN
So fire, huh?

TRAVIS
The only way I found to kill these bastards; deep-fry 'em.

DEAN
Well, that's gonna be... horrible. Is that what you did to Jack's dad?

TRAVIS
Uh-huh.

SAM comes into the room from outside, papers in hand.

SAM
Not wasting any time, are you?

TRAVIS
None to waste. The guy hulks out, we won't be finding bodies, just remains.

SAM sits down on the bed next to the table.

SAM
What if he doesn't hulk out? I did a little homework. Uh, I've been checking out the lore on rougarous.

TRAVIS
What? My 30 years of experience not good enough for you?

SAM
What? No. No, I-I- I just wanted to be prepared. I mean, not that you didn't..

DEAN
Sam loves research. He does. He keeps it under his mattress right next to his KY. It's a sickness.

He looks over at SAM

DEAN
It is.

SAM
Look, everything you said checked out, of course, but uh. I found a couple of interesting stories about people who have this rougarou gene or whatever. See, they start to turn, but they never take the final step.

DEAN
Really?

SAM
See, if they never eat human flesh, they don't fully transform.

DEAN
So what? Go vegan, stay human?

SAM
Basically. Or in this case, eat a lot of raw meat, just not...

DEAN
Long pig.

SAM
Right.

DEAN smiles a little, TRAVIS is just sitting next to him, having watched and listened to SAM about this under silence.

TRAVIS
Good on you for the due diligence, Sam.

He gets up.

TRAVIS
But those are fairy tales.

He walks over to the little pantry and pours himself another cup of coffee.

TRAVIS
Fact is, every rougarou I ever saw or heard of... took that bite.

SAM stands up while speaking.

SAM
Okay, well, that doesn't mean that Jack will.

DEAN watches SAM rise and then stands up himself.

TRAVIS
So what do we do? Sit and hope and wait for a body count?

SAM
No, we talk to him. Explain what's happening. That way he can fight it.

TRAVIS
Fight it?

He laughs

TRAVIS
Are you kidding me? You ever been really hungry?

This gets DEAN's attention, who's been looking at the papers SAM brought with him.

TRAVIS
I mean, haven't-eaten-in-days hungry?

DEAN
Yeah.

TRAVIS
Yeah. Right then. So somebody slaps a big, juicy sirloin in front of you, you walking away?

DEAN looks thoughtfull for a second and then admits "no" without words, only raising of eyebrows. He slowly looks over at SAM.

TRAVIS
That's what we are to him now, meat on legs. I'm sorry. I'm sure he's a stand-up guy, but it's pure, base instinct. Everything in nature's gotta eat. You think he can stop himself 'cause he's nice?

When SAM responds he sounds firm and very serious.

SAM
I don't know. But we're not gonna kill him unless he does something to get killed for.

DEAN looks over at him at that. SAM takes a few breaths and then walks out of the room. TRAVIS looks over at DEAN, a bit puzzled by SAM's reaction.

TRAVIS
What's up with your brother?

DEAN looks at the door and then TRAVIS.

DEAN
Don't get me started.

He turns to sit down again.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE - DAY

MICHELLE is in the kitchen in her nightgown, pouring tea. Her finger is bandaged. When she turns around, JACK is standing just behind her and he scares her by his sudden appearance.

MICHELLE
God. You scared me.

JACK
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you. How are you feeling?

MICHELLE puts down the mug with tea, and looks very annoyed and angry.

MICHELLE
I'm feeling pissed, Jack.

She walks away from him, but stays in the kitchen. She turns back around to him.

MICHELLE
I had to drive myself to the hospital last night. I was there until 2.

JACK
I'm so sorry.

MICHELLE
What happened?

JACK
I don't know. I saw your blood and I-I... got dizzy, and I just had to get out.

MICHELLE
Well, you could have called. I left you a dozen messages.

JACK
I know. My phone died. I couldn't find a payphone. I... it was a mess. But I am... sorry.

MICHELLE's anger has melted somewhat.

JACK
And I promise it won't ever happen again. Certainly. Not to a wife as stunning as you.

He walks up to her, smiling. She melts with that and they make up.

MICHELLE
Better not. I swear, you know. One little cut.

JACK kisses her bandaged finger.

MICHELLE
Blood's never bothered you before.

JACK
Well... I've changed.

They kiss.

MICHELLE
This doesn't get you off the hook, you know.

JACK smiles.

MICHELLE
No, no. Think, think diamonds. Think Kobe-sized.

JACK
Mhm.

They kiss again. JACK lifts her up on the counter and they kiss again and then he begins to kiss her neck.

MICHELLE
What has gotten into you?

JACK
I don't know.

He pushes away her hair and kisses her neck. MICHELLE laughs but then JACK becomes more and more rough, and MICHELLE becomes a bit unsettled. JACK pulls away from her neck.

MICHELLE
Hey, Jack. Just slow down.

JACK doesn't respond, he just grabs her by the back of her head and kisses her hard again.

MICHELLE
Jack.

JACK goes for her neck and throat again.

MICHELLE
Jack, I mean it. Stop.

He pulls up her nightgown, and MICHELLE tries to stop him.

MICHELLE
Jack.

He slams her against the cupboard, but doesn't leave her neck.

MICHELLE
Ow! Jack! Stop! Stop it!

She pushes him away.

MICHELLE
Stop it!

She jumps down from the counter. JACK looks almost stunned at what he's just done.

MICHELLE
You son of a bitch.

JACK
I'm sorry.

MICHELLE
What the hell is wrong with you?

JACK
I don't know. I don't know.

He leaves the kitchen.

EXT. IMPALA - DAY

The boys are driving down a road, DEAN is behind the wheel as per usual.

DEAN (V.O)
All right, so we're gonna go have a little chat with this guy-

INT. IMPALA

DEAN
-which, you know... I'm down.

SAM is just sitting quietly next to him, staring out the front windshield with a serious look on his face.

DEAN
But I just want to make sure, if push comes, you're gonna shove.

He looks over at SAM, who finally turns to him.

SAM
Meaning?

DEAN
Well, odds are we're gonna have to burn this guy alive.

SAM
This guy has a name and a wife.

DEAN
Yeah, who we're probably gonna make a widow, okay? I mean, you heard Travis. He's gonna turn. They always turn.

SAM
Well, maybe he won't. Maybe he can fight it off.

DEAN
And maybe he can't, that's all I'm saying.

SAM
All right, we'll just have to see then, okay?

DEAN
This is what I mean, Sam. You sure your emotions aren't getting in the way here?

SAM looks at him with a confused look.

SAM
What are you talking about?

DEAN
You know, nice dude, but he's got something evil inside. Something in his blood. Maybe you can relate.

DEAN looks over at him, but SAM doesn't respond with a look of his own. He looks pretty angry though.

SAM
Stop the car.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Stop the car or I will!

They share a look.

EXT. IMPALA

DEAN drives to the side of the road, but before the car has completely slowed to a stop SAM has already opened his door and is getting out. As DEAN opens his door, SAM slams his own shut and turns around to him, angry.

SAM
You want to know why I've been lying to you, Dean? Because of crap like this.

They start to walk around the front of the car.

DEAN
Like what?

SAM
The way you talk to me, the way you look at me like I'm a freak!

SAM walks past DEAN, and then turns around to him, now completely pissed off.

DEAN
I do not.

SAM
You know, or even worse, like I'm an idiot!

He walks up to DEAN, and almost gets in his face.

SAM
Like I don't know the difference between right and wrong!

He steps back, turns his back to DEAN and walks a few steps. He then stops, hands on hips, back still to DEAN, who's watching him. When SAM finally turns around, DEAN looks down.

SAM
What?

DEAN looks up at him again, and now he sounds a bit angry.

DEAN
Do you know the difference, Sam? I mean, you've been kind of strolling a dark road lately.

SAM
You have no idea what I'm going through. None.

DEAN
Then enlighten me!

SAM
I've got demon blood in me, Dean! This disease pumping through my veins, and I can't ever rip it out or scrub it clean! I'm a whole new level of freak! And I'm just trying to take this - this curse... and make something good out of it. Because I have to.

DEAN looks at him for a few moments, as SAM looks down on the ground. After a while, DEAN finally says something in a calm voice.

DEAN
Let's just go talk to the guy.

SAM scoffs.

DEAN
I mean Jack. Okay?

After a moment, SAM gives a small, almost non-existant, nod, but he doesn't look at DEAN.

EXT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE; GARDEN

JACK is standing the garden with the hose in his hand, watering plants. Suddenly SAM and DEAN emerge through the backdoor to the garden behind JACK. As they walk over to him, the camera moves around in front of JACK and he seems completely spaced out, just holding the hose, and staring into nothing.

SAM
Jack Montgomery?

JACK doesn't turn right away, take a moment, and then he just looks around, over at the boys.

SAM
I'm Sam Winchester. This is my brother; Dean.

JACK turns around and looks at them as they walk up to him.

SAM
We need to talk.

JACK looks at him and then at DEAN, who looks around a bit. JACK looks back at SAM.

JACK
About?

SAM
About you. About how you're changing.

JACK
Excuse me?

DEAN
You're probably feeling your bones move under your skin. And your appetite's reaching, you know, "hungry hungry hippo" levels. How am I doing so far?

JACK
Who the hell are you guys?

DEAN
We're people who know a little something about something.

SAM
We're people who can help. Please, just hear us out.

CUT TO: LATER

JACK
A-a what?

DEAN
A rougarou. Sounds made-up, I know, but believe me, it's not.

JACK
Alright, I've noticed certain things. I mean, some strange things. But I just, I-I don't know. I'm.. I'm sick or something.

SAM
Your father was one of these things.

JACK turns around to SAM at that.

SAM
Your real father. He passed it on to you.

JACK
No. Are-are you guys listening to yourselves? You s-sound like you're-

DEAN
Skip the whole "you guys sound crazy", shall we? You're hungry, Jack. You're only gonna get hungrier.

JACK
Hungrier for?

DEAN
Long pig. You know, a little manburger helper, may have crossed your mind already.

JACK
No.

SAM
It doesn't have to be like this, Jack. You can fight it off.

JACK
No.

SAM
Others have.

DEAN
We're not gonna lie to you, though. It's not gonna be easy. You're gonna feel like an alcoholic swimming around in whiskey. But I'm telling you. You gotta say no... or-

JACK
Or what?

SAM
You feed once, and it's all over. And then we'll have to stop you.

JACK
Stop me? My dad, did uh, somebody stop him?

SAM
Yes.

JACK
Get off my property right now. I see you guys again, I'm calling the cops.

SAM
Jack, your wife, everybody you know, they're in danger.

JACK
Now!

JACK's neighbour, who's cutting a bush, looks over at them when JACK raises his voice. SAM sighs and they begin to walk away.

DEAN
Good talk.

JACK watches them leave.

EXT. BENCH - NIGHT

JACK is sitting on a bench, listening to a message from MICHELLE on his cellphone.

MICHELLE (V.O)
Jack, I don't know where you are but you're scaring me. Come home. We need to talk. Please?

The mailbox beeps and JACK lowers his phone, closing it. He then looks up at the building across the street from him where a woman is undressing. He watches her for a bit and when she closes her drapes he slowly stands and with his eyes fixed on her window, he crosses the street. As he walks out of the camera shot, we see SAM and DEAN parked in the IMPALA, watching him.

INT. IMPALA

SAM turns around to the backseat as we see JACK running across the street, to the woman's building.

SAM
Damn it. Jack. No.

He pulls up the flamethrower and exists the car. DEAN grabs a flamethrower as well and gets out the car too.

DEAN
Come on.

EXT. BUILDING

JACK is climbing the fire-escape, heading for the woman's window. The boys run up to the building, looking up at JACK. They head for the stairs to the entrance and hurries in. JACK has reached the woman's floor, and we can hear a heartbeat as JACK watches the woman walk around in the appartment. He's breathing shallow breathes. His head is twitching a bit unhuman. The woman removes her bra with her back to JACK, and then puts on a t-shirt. She turns off the light and we see JACK reflected in the window, and he does too, seeing his bloodshot eyes.

JACK
No. No.

He moves away.

INT. APARTMENT

SAM and DEAN kick down the door and hurry through it, flamethrowers at the ready. They meet the woman, who's just coming out of her bedroom and they scare the living hell out of her with that entrance. She screams and backs into her bedroom.

DEAN
Wait!

She slams her door. DEAN and SAM is still standing by the front door, looking a bit confused.

DEAN
Whoa, uh, we're here to save you, I guess.

SAM looks around, and we hear the woman locking her bedroomdoor.

WOMAN (through door)
I'm calling the police!

SAM
We should go.

DEAN
Yeah.

They hurry out, DEAN turns around and closes the door with a little embarassed laugh. The frame of the door, where the lock is, is completely broken.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

JACK comes in through the front door, looking up at the top of the stairs. He walks over to the foot of them, and smiles a little, and calls out to his wife.

JACK
Michelle! I'm home!

She doesn't respond, and the only thing we hear is the ticking of an old clock.

JACK
Hey, babe?!

He starts walking towards the living room.

JACK
Are you here?

We suddenly hear a muffled sound and heavy breathing. JACK stops and we see MICHELLE sitting tied to a chair, with a gag. She begins to move in the chair, screaming to him through her muzzle.

JACK
Michelle.

Suddenly an arm comes around JACK's neck and a piece of cloth is put over his nose and mouth.

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
CUT TO: LATER

JACK is handcuffed to a pillar, and out cold. He finally wakes up and discovers he's bound. He rattles the handcuffs a few times, trying to get loose. He looks up and sees MICHELLE, still bound and gagged, sitting next to him.

JACK
Michelle?

TRAVIS walks up in front of her, and stands in front of JACK.

JACK
Okay. We're gonna stay calm. We're gonna give this man whatever he wants.

TRAVIS looks down with those words, knowing what it is he's come for, and he's sad because of it.

JACK
Anything. Just take it and go, please.

TRAVIS
I'm sorry about this, Jack.

He walks over to MICHELLE who's very scared.

TRAVIS
I truly am.

He begins to untie the gag.

TRAVIS
It's not the way that I wanted it to go.

JACK
Who are you?

TRAVIS
You already met some friends of mine.

He walks over to JACK.

TRAVIS
Two brothers?

JACK
They said that if I...

He looks over at his wife, who's shaking. She looks back at him.

JACK
Look, I haven't hurt anybody.

TRAVIS
Not yet, but you would've.

JACK shakes his head.

TRAVIS
They always do. I'm doing you a favor, son.

MICHELLE
Jack, what's he talking about?

JACK looks at her but doesn't say anything. TRAVIS takes a few steps closer to JACK.

TRAVIS
Tell her, Jack. Tell her the truth. She deserves to know.

JACK shakes his head again, and MICHELLE looks from TRAVIS to JACK.

JACK
Just let her go. She's not a part of this.

MICHELLE
A part of what?

MICHELLE is no longer crying or shaking. She's just confused over this. JACK looks over at her.

MICHELLE
Jack?!

TRAVIS
I really do apologize, but she is a part of it.

JACK
What?

TRAVIS looks over at MICHELLE.

TRAVIS
Michelle... tell him what you told me when I got here.

MICHELLE stares at TRAVIS, tears in her eyes. JACK is looking over at her, confused.

JACK
Michelle?

MICHELLE looks over at JACK.

MICHELLE
I said... "Don't hurt me... because I'm pregnant".

Her voice breaks with the last word and she begins to cry. TRAVIS looks over at JACK, who turns his eyes back to him as well.

JACK
J-just hold on a minute.

TRAVIS
Now you see the mess we're in? I can't make this mistake all over again. I won't be around in 30 years, this has got to end now. I know you don't believe me, but I'd give anything not to have to do this.

JACK begins to shake his head, pleading.

JACK
No. No. No..

JACK tries to move forward but is stopped by the cuffs. He looks back towards them as MICHELLE looks over at him, scared. As TRAVIS begins to take out his weapons, JACK rattles the handcuffs. TRAVIS takes out a can of gas, which MICHELLE sees and becomes desperate.

MICHELLE
Oh God! Please don't!

JACK
You don't have to do this!

JACK begins to pour out gas.

JACK
If you want to kill me, kill me, but not my wife. Okay? I'm begging you.

TRAVIS
Ain't got no choice. My condolences.

TRAVIS walks around with the can, emptying it. Desperate, JACK begins to pull on his handcuffs again.

MICHELLE
Jack.

Suddenly we get a flash of blood pumping in veins again, like we saw in the bar, and JACK's eyes becomes bloodshot. He continues to struggle and we get a shot of JACK and MICHELLE kissing, and then blood moving in veins again. A few more of those flashes and then of his reflection in the woman's window earlier. Finally, JACK breaks the chain between the cuffs and he's free. He jumps on TRAVIS right away, pushing him to the floor. Sitting on top of him, JACK begins to hit TRAVIS. TRAVIS hits back after two hooks from JACK, and JACK falls to the floor. TRAVIS moves over and sits over him, hitting him hard of the chest with his arm in a cast, while MICHELLE watches in terror.

MICHELLE
Jack!

TRAVIS hits him again and then when he goes for a third hit, JACK captures his arm and breaks the cast. TRAVIS screams out in pain. JACK throws him to the floor and then gets on top of him, moving his arms away. We hear a heavy heartbeat and JACK's eyes are completely bloodshot now. He holds TRAVIS in a choke hold with one hand and then rips away TRAVIS's shirt with the other, exposing his shoulder and neck. JACK watches as the blood pumps beneath the surface of TRAVIS's throat and then he goes in for the kill, biting down. TRAVIS screams out in pain and JACK rips a part of his throat away with his teeth and sits up again, and chews on the piece of skin. TRAVIS bleeds out quickly, leaving a big pool of blood underneath him. JACK just chews away on the piece he just ripped from TRAVIS. The camera focuses on MICHELLE who watches all this, in shock. JACK goes in for another bite, and TRAVIS dies. We see as JACK is taking the second bite, how his face is changing, becoming ugly and contorted. MICHELLE just stares, in shock and terror. Suddenly JACK whips around and looks at her, his face compeltely covered in TRAVIS's blood. He turns around and then stands up. He walks over to MICHELLE, who's scared and crying now, and he squats down next to her. He frees her and she jumps out of the chair quickly and moves away from him.

MICHELLE
Stay away from me!

JACK sobs out her name.

JACK
Michelle.

MICHELLE bolts for the door and runs out.

EXT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

MICHELLE runs over to her car, keys in hand, and pulls open the door to the drivers side. She gets in and drives off quickly, tires almost screaming.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

JACK is standing in the same spot where MICHELLE left him, breathing heavily with sadness. Slowly the monster takes over though as his eyes falls on TRAVIS's body. He walks slowly over to him.

EXT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

The boys pulls up in front of the house, and we see a car on the otherside of the street. They slowly gets out, flamethrowers in hand. DEAN walks around the IMPALA to SAM.

DEAN
I guess now we know where Travis is.

They start walking towards the house.

SAM
That stupid son of a bitch.

DEAN looks over at SAM by that comment. They reach the porchsteps.

INT. MONTGOMERY RESIDENCE

The frontdoor slowly opens and DEAN comes in first, eyes on the stairs. As he moves in, SAM follows and we get a shot of the livingroom. The chair MICHELLE was tied to before has fallen to the floor. Neither TRAVIS's body or JACK can be seen. The camera moves down to the floor where TRAVIS bleed out and we see a big bloodpool soaked up by the carpet. DEAN and SAM stop by the entrance to the livingroom when they see that. A bloodtrail from the pool to behind the couch can be seen, from where JACK as dragged TRAVIS behind it. The boys share a look.

CUT TO: FLOOR BEHIND THE COUCH

We see a piece of meat on the floor, as SAM walks over to it, closely followed by DEAN. They stop by it and looks down.

DEAN
Oh, God. Think that's Travis?

SAM sighs.

SAM
What's left of him.

DEAN looks at him. SAM looks defeated.

SAM
Guess you were right about Jack.

Before DEAN can respond he's suddenly pushed forward and JACK jumps him from behind.

SAM
Dean!

They slam down on the coffee table, knocking out DEAN. SAM quickly moves around them and pulls up his flamethrower and puts up his lighter in front of it, to light it. JACK turns around to him and jumps him before he can get a flame. They slam to the floor, SAM hits the back of his head. Before SAM has a chance to do anything, JACK grabs the flamethrower and slams it into SAM's face, effectivly knocking him out.

CUT TO: LATER

SAM is on the floor of the closet, knocked out. As the camera closes in on him, he slowly wakes up. After a second he remembers where he is and he gets up and goes for the doorhandle, but it's locked.

SAM
Dean?

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK
Dean can't come to the phone right now.

INT. CLOSET

SAM slams his hand against the door twice, angry.

SAM
Jack! If you hurt him, I swear to God!

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK
Calm down!

The camera cuts to a wider shot and we see DEAN is still lying on the coffee table, knocked out and JACK is sitting by his feet.

JACK
Your brother's alive.

INT. CLOSET

SAM relaxes a bit with that news and rests his head against the door, panting.

JACK (V.O)
But not if you-

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK
-don't calm down.

INT. CLOSET

SAM is completely calm now.

SAM
Alright, Jack. Listen. Open the door. We can figure this out, okay?

JACK laughs at that.

JACK (V.O)
We'll have ourselves a little-

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK
-brainstorming session.

He's close to tears out of desperation.

SAM (V.O)
Jack.

INT. CLOSET

SAM
Please.

JACK (V.O)
I don't think so.

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK
After what you did?

INT. CLOSET

SAM is confused by that.

SAM
What? What are you talking about?

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK
You send your friend here. He tried to burn my-

INT. CLOSET

JACK
-wife alive.

SAM
What? Why?

SAM is going through his pockets.

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK realizes they don't know, so he lies.

JACK
He didn't say.

INT. CLOSET

SAM looks around and sees a metal hanger. He grabs it.

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK
I guess psychopaths don't have to explain themselves.

He looks over at DEAN and slowly begins to move along his body.

SAM (V.O)
Listen to me. You gotta believe me.

INT. CLOSET

SAM
My brother and I, we never would have hurt her, okay?

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK comes up by DEAN's face, who's still knocked out. With a shaking hand, JACK reaches out and dips his fingers in the little pool of blood that has formed by DEAN's head. He turns his hand over, looking at the blood on his finger. He then sucks it off, enjoying the taste. He begins to rock back and forth.

JACK
Oh, God. I'm so hungry.

INT. CLOSET

SAM has used the metalwired hanger and re-formed it so he can pick the lock.

SAM
Jack, don't do this.

He bends down and goes for the lock.

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK turns towards the closetdoor.

JACK
I can't ever see my family again.

INT. CLOSET

SAM works the lock.

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK turns back to DEAN.

JACK
You two... your friend. You made me into this!

INT. CLOSET

SAM is still working on the lock.

SAM
No one's making you kill us.

The lock won't agree with him and he takes down his hands for a moment.

SAM
Listen to me.

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK is looking up at the ceiling and then he looks down again as SAM speaks.

SAM (V.O)
You got this dark pit inside you. I know.

INT. CLOSET

SAM is leaning against the door again, with his eyes closed.

SAM
Believe me, I know.

He opens his eyes.

SAM
But that doesn't mean you have to fall into it. You don't have to be a monster.

He begins to work on the lock again.

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK laughs at that.

JACK
Have you seen me lately?

SAM (V.O)
It doesn't matter what you are.

INT. CLOSET

SAM
It only matters what you do. It's your choice.

INT. LIVINGROOM

JACK sits still for a moment and then he grunts in pain. Then he begins to move up to DEAN's head again, with his mouth open, looking like he's slowly going down the road of eating DEAN. DEAN slowly begins to wake up now. JACK puts a hand on his shoulder, eyes completely fixed upon DEAN. We suddenly hear a door slam open.

SAM
Jack!

JACK whips around towards the closetdoor, and we see SAM standing there, flamethrower and lighter in hands, ready. JACK sits still for a moment, like he decides something, while SAM is only watching him. Then he lunges for SAM and as DEAN slowly lifts his head and is slowly turning it around over his shoulder we hear SAM flip the lighter and the flamethrower goes off. DEAN turns his head back around, to shield it. And then he turns back and watches while SAM burns JACK alive. JACK finally falls to the floor, in flames. DEAN looks over at SAM, who's sad by this outcome. Defeated even.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. IMPALA - NIGHT

The IMPALA comes down a road, fast.

INT. IMPALA

They're driving under silence, DEAN behind the wheels. He looks over at SAM who's just staring out the window. DEAN turns back to the road.

DEAN
You did the right thing, you know. That guy was a monster, there was no going back.

SAM doesn't respond, he only lowers his head.

DEAN
Sam, I wanna tell you I'm sorry. I've been kind of hard on you lately.

SAM lifts his head again, looking out, and he looks so broken.

SAM
Don't worry about it, Dean.

DEAN
It's just that your, uh, your psychic thing, it scares the crap out of me.

SAM
Look, if it's all the same... I'd really rather not talk about it.

He looks over at DEAN. DEAN looks back at him and a little smile plays on his lips.

DEAN
Wait a minute. What? You don't want to talk? You?

SAM doesn't reply to the smile or joke.

SAM
There's nothing more to say. I can't keep explaining myself to you. I can't make you understand.

DEAN
Why don't you try?

SAM
I can't. Because this thing, this blood, it's not in you the way it's in me. It's just something I got to deal with.

DEAN
Not alone.

SAM sighs and looks out through the passengerwindow and we see him reflected in it. He's silent for a while.

SAM
Anyway, it doesn't matter. These powers... it's playing with fire. I'm done with them.

DEAN looks over at him.

SAM
I'm done with everything.

DEAN
Really?

SAM continues to look out his window and DEAN turns back to the road.

DEAN
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

SAM turns around to him and scoffs a little.

SAM
Don't thank me. I'm not doing it for you. Or for the angels or for anybody. This is my choice.
