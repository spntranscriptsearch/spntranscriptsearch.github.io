'St. Louis, Missouri

Back Alley of a Hotel - Night

The streets are damp and the air is foggy.

[ Indistinct conversation ]
A MAN and a WOMAN out of the back door and into an alley of a cheap motel. The alley is dark but lit by a pink neon hotel sign.

[ Door closes ]

[ Siren wailing in distance ]

It appears someone is watching them from a car nearby.

MAN
You were great, and I want to give you a little something. The man gives the woman money and touches her arm as he starts to walk away from her smiling at her.

MAN:
Here you go. Thanks.
WOMAN
Thank you.
MAN
Yeah.
The camera moves into the nearby car and we see the back of a man’s head. We see he is watching the WOMAN who is now standing alone.
The WOMAN sticks the money in her purse and zips it up.
The Woman starts to walk away. She walks away from the car where the mysterious man is sitting.
The mysterious man in the car gets out of the car.
The woman turns her head.
She sees no one but keeps walking forward while looking behind her.
The alley appears empty which seems to confuse her so she stops and turns almost all the way around to get a better look. When she decides no one is there she looks forward and begins walking again.
[ Banging in distance ]
[ WOMAN Gasps ]
This time she turns all the way around and the camera zooms fast on her face but she still sees nothing.
As she turns we see someone standing in her path. She becomes very startled to see a MAN standing there.
[ WOMAN Gasps ]
The MAN flashes his police badge.
[WOMAN Sighs ]

WOMAN
Guess it's not my night.

MAN
Guess not.
The POLICEMAN pulls out a pair of handcuffs and the WOMAN turns around to be cuffed. Neither of them look surprised or seem to find the situation unordinary. They both have blank expressions on their faces as they both seem to have done this before.
The POLICEMAN steps up behind her and places the cuffs on her wrists. The POLICEMAN turns her around and the WOMAN looks at him unimpressed. The POLICEMAN suddenly grabs the woman, and begins to choke her.
[ WOMAN Screams ]
The POLICEMAN is suddenly in his bed waking up from what seems like a nightmare. He appears to still behaving the nightmare as he sees himself to continue to kill the WOMAN and we see camera shots of her being killed.
The POLICEMAN looks very upset and scared after waking up and the camera pans from him on his bed to a Doberman pincher lying nearby on his right. The DOG jumps up as she notices her master waking up from this nightmare.
The dog climbs on the right side of bed with the POLICEMAN and he reaches his right hand out to caress her. The POLICEMAN calms down but the dog begins to whine as the POLICEMAN lies back down.
The DOG lays her head across her master’s lap and sniffs his hand.
[ DOG Sniffs ]
POLICEMANS KITCHEN-NEXT DAY
The POLICEMAN walks into his kitchen wearing a blue robe. He walks by a fireplace where you see a letter of commendation on the mantle.
The POLICEMAN grabs a coffee cup off the counter and he walks over to the coffeepot and opens the top lid where the filter basket is and he removes the filter basket.
[ Filter basket clatters ]
The POLICEMAN closes the coffeepot lid and walks over to the trashcan. As he leans over to open the round trash can we see the dirty filter filled with used coffee grounds.
The camera is looking up at the POLICEMAN from inside the trash can as he opens it and the POLICEMAN looks down inside the trashcan.
The music in the background is high pitched but low but begins to intensify.
He appears confused by what he sees in the trashcan so he sets the coffee filter basket on the counter and reaches his hand in the trash can and pulls out a bloodstained shirt.
The music intensifies even more to show the suspense of the situation.
The music becomes louder and more high-pitched as the screen flashes.

Sleepy Lodge Motel - Night
[ engine rumbles ]
We hear the engine of the Impala as we see the sign for the Sleepy Lodge Motel.
The camera pans down and we see the Impala drive through a damp parking lot and pull into a parking space.
[ Engine shuts off ]
DEAN and SAM exit the car at the same time. As DEAN gets out of the driver’s side he looks over his shoulder and continues a conversation with SAM.

DEAN
Wow.You know, of all the lame-ass things you've ever said, that's got to be the lame-assiest.

They continue their argument as they gather their things from the car.

SAM
I'm sorry, but I happen to think Shemp was a funnier stooge than Curly.

DEAN
Curly was a freaking genius!

They begin to walk into the hotel room still arguing.

SAM
I always found Curly's work a bit obvious.

DEAN
It's supposed to be obvious, man. They’re stooges!

SAM and DEAN walk into the dark hotel room with SAM walking in first and SAM turns on the light.
[ Light switch clicks ]

SAM
So, we calling James tonight?

DEAN
No. I'll just call him tomorrow. That drive was a bitch.

DEAN says the last line as he closes the hotel room door behind him.
SAM and Dean each walk to a different bed and set their bags on it.

SAM
I wonder what he wanted.

DEAN
Well, his text said that he needed help. He's a cop. I figured it was work-related.

SAM
Yeah, well, we do owe him.

DEAN
The guy saved our lives once,Sammy. I mean, it's not like the guy –

SAM
Saved our lives?

DEAN looks down and appears to have something else to say but says nothing.
SAM closes the zipper on one of his bags
[ Zipper closes ]

DEAN
I'm gonna go for a beer run. You need anything?

SAM
No, I'm good.

DEAN
You sure?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
'Cause you did just gank a Hellhound, which is no slice of pie, and, uh, there is a mine field of who knows what crap ahead. Just want to make sure that you are okay.

SAM
I'm good.

DEAN
'Cause, you know, we could find another devil dog. You could tag out. I could snuff the son of a bitch.

SAM starts to become visible annoyed with what DEAN is saying.

SAM
Dean, Kevin doesn't even know what the next trial is yet.So whatever it is you're worried about, stop. I'll be ready.

DEAN nods his head once in acknowledgement and walks out the hotel room door.
[ Door opens, closes ]
SAM sets his saving kit on the sink of the hotel room and begins to unpack it when he hears a scraping sound at the door.
[ Scraping ]
SAM becomes curious and walks over to the door and opens it.
[ Door hinges creak ]
On the other side of the door is the same Doberman that was in the POLICEMANS bedroom.
[ DOG Whining ]
SAM looks around for an owner and then back at the DOG inquisitively when suddenly the DOG runs into the room and jumps on DEANS bed.

SAM
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[ DOG Whines ]


SAM
Uh...No. Um...

SAM shuts the door and starts to walk into the room.
[ Door closes ]

SAM
Hey. You friendly? Friendly. Good. All right. You're a pretty dog.
[ DOG Whines ]
The DOG rolls over and wants her belly scratched and SAM obliges.

SAM
Oh, really? You want, uh -- you want a little belly scratch, huh? So, who do you belong to?Uh...

[ DOG Whines ]
SAM
Right. No tags. Uh, what are you doing here?
[ Engine rumbles, turns off ]
SAM becomes alert to the fact that DEAN just pulled in and music starts playing fast in the background.

SAM
Oh, no.
[ DOG Whines ]
SAM quickly steps outside the hotel room to greet DEAN.

SAM
Hey!
Once outside SAM shuts the hotel room door behind him placing himself between DEAN and the door.
[ Door closes ]

DEAN
Hey.

SAM
Okay, okay, okay. Before you get pissed off, look, I-I just want you to know this isn't my fault. She just showed up at the door, okay? Didn't track in any mud. Just wanted her belly scratched. I-I figured maybe she could stay tonight, and we'd try and find her a home tomorrow.
SAM opens the door with a worried half smile on his face to show DEAN what he is talking about and DEAN looks into the room past SAM. DEAN sees a very attractive, nicely dressed, woman sitting on his bed with her back against the headboard. She is wearing the same collar the DOG had on and the DOG is no longer in the room.

DEAN
She can stay the night.

SAM looks into the room and sees the woman. SAM then looks back at DEAN very confused.

SAM
Two seconds ago, she was a dog.

SAM unsheathes a knife from behind his back and quickly walks back into the room and towards the WOMAN.

SAM
All right, who the hell are you?

WOMAN/DOG
Not a shapeshifter, so you can stash the blade.

DEAN walks in the room and sets the items he just bought onto the hotel room table.

SAM stands at the end of the bed ready to strike.

WOMAN/DOG
I'm a familiar.

DEAN
A what?

SAM
Companion to a witch --some witches. Split their time between human and animal form.
WOMAN/DO
I get a more accurate read on people in my other persona. Approaching guys in a motel room like this --well, it gets complicated.

SAM
Hmm.

WOMAN/DOG
My name's Portia. I belong to James Frampton.

DEAN
No. No, no. See, that --that doesn't work for us, 'cause that would mean that our buddy James is a witch.

PORTIA
[ Sarcastically ]
Wow. You're quick.

DEAN
James is a freaking witch?

PORTIA
He wasn't when you met him, but that last case you worked on with him --

SAM
Uh, lunatic alchemist. It was nasty.

PORTIA stands up and starts to walk closer to DEAN and SAM who are standing about a foot apart.

PORTIA
James wanted to learn more about that world -- the black arts, witchcraft. It became the center of his life.

DEAN
Wait, so you're telling me that James the cop became a witch because of us? Unh-unh. [ DEAN Laughs ]

PORTIA
You don't like dogs, do you?

[ DEAN Scoffs softly ]

SAM
Wait. So James isn't a cop anymore?

PORTIA
Sure he is. Homicide detective. His new powers make his work even better.

SAM
Then what does he need from us?

PORTIA
Well, something's been happening to him. It started with excruciating headaches, screaming sounds in his ears, horrible nightmares. Unable to sleep or think. He can't work. It -- it's like he's having a breakdown. Maybe you can find a way to help him.

DEAN looks at SAM.
[ DEAN Scoffs ]

DEAN
Well, here's the thing. Uh, witches -- not real fans.

PORTIA steps closer to DEAN and is right in front of him when she speaks clearly and roughly.

PORTIA
Really? Well, James is a cop with a spotless record. He's used his skills for nothing but good. So why don't you lose the ignorant bigotry for maybe two seconds and give him a shot?

DEAN to SAM
That was incredibly hot.

[ PORTIA Scoffs ]
PORTIA looks to SAM

SAM
It was pretty hot.
PORTIA shakes her head at both of them.

Outside Nightclub - Night
[ jazz music plays ]
[ Indistinct conversations ]
You see a man move a chess piece with his mind and his female opponent do the same.
A waitress places a drink on the table where JAMES FRAMPTON is sitting and removes the empty glass next to it. A man walks up that is looking at JAMES.

MAN
You might want to go easy
on that.

The MAN sits in the only other chair at JAMES’ table.

MAN
God, you look awful. Not getting any better?

JAMES
Worse. I don't know what's happening to me. These dreams [sniffs] they're like, um -- like torture.

MAN
You didn't mention dreams.

JAMES
Dark, bloody. Spencer, they, uh -- they scare the hell out of me. They're so real. Just night after night.

SPENCER
Enough, James. It's time to see someone.

JAMES
Who? Who do we see? There's no medicine for this.

SPENCER
Maybe you just need time away.

JAMES
It's way beyond that.

SPENCER
James, it's too much -- all that you've taken on. Not just the workload, but the nature of the work. Look around. See a lot of cops, do you? Life in this realm is life on the fringe. We don't fit.
[ SPENCER Sighs ]
How do you reconcile what you are with what you do?

JAMES
I don't know where Portia is.

SPENCER
What?

JAMES
She's gone. I think I'm pushing her away.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Sleepy Lodge Motel - Night

DEAN
So, these dreams James is having -- he thinks that they're real? He thinks that he is actually killing people?

PORTIA
I think so. At least that's what I picked up before he started blocking me.

SAM
What does that mean, blocking you?

PORTIA
Familiars and their masters -- we can communicate telepathically. I can get inside of James' head anytime I want. But he shut me out.

SAM
So, what, you think maybe there's something in there he doesn't want you to see?

PORTIA
Possibly, yeah -- something dark, you know, that's destroying him. He can't go to the police, and he doesn't trust other witches.

DEAN
But he trusts us? You do know who we are, right? We're the last people that somebody like James needs to be telling his troubles to.

PORTIA
This was my idea. I was the one who sent you the text under James' name. He doesn't know you're here. But...I think you're maybe all he has.

[ SAM Sighs ]

City Park - Night
[ Leaves rustling ]
A blind man is walking through the park on the sidewalk using his white cane. A man is standing off to the side in the grass . The blindman hears the person rustling around

BLINDMAN
Someone there?

JAMES is suddenly right next to the BLINDMAN and he grabs the BLINDMAN with one hand
[ BLINDMAN Gasps ]
JAMES is seen choking the man so hard that he tears through his skin and the BLINDMANS’ blood splatters allover JAMES’ face.
JAMES wakes up in his bed again terrified and shaking.
[ Breathing heavily ]

James’ House – Day
James and Portia are having an argument in a room off camera.
JAMES
You had no right to do this.

PORTIA
I was afraid for your life!

The camera pans around the living room and you see DEAN sitting in a chair and SAM sitting on a couch and listening to the argument between JAMES and PORTIA.

JAMES
My life is none of their business!

PORTIA (as a dog) walks out of the room they are arguing in and looks at the brothers. SAM cocks his head and DEAN smiles and waves casually.

[PORTIA Barks ]
PORTIA walks off camera
JAMES walks out of the room looking disheveled and stops a couple feet from where SAM and DEAN are sitting. SAM and DEAN stand up.

JAMES
Sam, Dean.

DEAN
Witchcraft, James? Really? What the hell are you thinking?

JAMES
You come to help or pile on?

DEAN
I'm just saying, you screw with that stuff, you're gonna fry your wiring.

SAM
All right. Look, why don't you tell us about these dreams? She said people were dying in them.

James
"Dying"? They were torn to bits. I, uh, I could feel my fingers ripping into their flesh.

DEAN
But they were dreams?

JAMES
Well, I, uh, woke up in my bed.

SAM
Okay, so...Dreams?

JAMES
I'm not so sure.

DEAN
Not helping, James.

JAMES
Those people -- they died. I checked with the precinct.

SAM
All right, well, maybe you heard it, and it stuck in your head.

JAMES
You're -- you don't think I-I told myself all that? You don't think I didn't say, "that wasn't me. I couldn't have done such a thing"?

JAMES steps back and reaches to a bag sitting to his left and unzips a pouch and pulls out the blood stained shirt he found in his trashcan after having the dream about killing the sex worker. SAM looks surprised and DEAN has an “I told you so” look as JAMES presents it to the brothers.

SAM
Is it yours?

JAMES shows the initials embroidered on the pocket that are JMF.

JAMES
James Martin Frampton.

JAMES tosses the shirt on the coffee table and sits down in a seat across from the seat DEAN was sitting in and places his hand on his forehead.

JAMES
What's happening to me?

DEAN and SAM sit back down.

DEAN
Well, how about this? Um, you pissed off another witch, and he or she hexed you and forced you to...

JAMES
It's possible, I suppose, but I never heard of it.

SAM
How many of these dreams have you had?

JAMES
Four. The most recent one is last night. Uh, it was a blind man. I, uh... I was choking him, and, uh...

DEAN
All right, James, we're gonna -- we're gonna help you figure this out, but you're gonna have to do your part.

JAMES
Which is?

DEAN tosses a bag onto the table and it makes a loud clanging sound. DEAN unzips the bag and pulls out thick chains and hold them up while looking at JAMES.

DEAN
You're gonna have to stay put.

DEAN lets the chains drop back into the bag.
[ Chains clank ]
DEAN
House arrest, my friend.

Sleepy Lodge Motel – Day
SAM is sitting on his bed doing research on his computer about the case. On his screen you see an article about the murdered woman. The title of the article reads “GRISLY REMAINS FOUND”
DEAN walks in the hotel room holding a plain, small paper bag.

DEAN
Got the last of it.

SAM
All right. Well, I have been looking at the crime-scene reports, and they are exactly the same as James told us -- vics, dates, location. The most recent one was a blind man, just like he said.

DEAN
That's not good.

DEAN looks down at the table where you see a bunch of ingredients in jars set up and ready to be used.
DEAN begins to take out the ingredients from the bag he brought in which appear to be chicken feet and some black stuff in a bag.

SAM
Also, I looked into his record on the force. He went from rookie detective to lieutenant basically overnight, and in the last four years, his solve rate's been right at about 100%.

DEAN
Of course. He's got the booga-booga on his side.

DEAN looks down at the ingredients on the table.

DEAN
Man, you know that we've never actually seen this witch-killing spell of Bobby's work, right? I mean, this is not a sure thing.

[ SAM Chuckles ]
SAM
Is anything we ever do a sure thing?

DEAN
Well, no, but I would just like to have the odds in our favor as much as possible.

SAM
Right?

DEAN
Well, I'm concerned.

SAM
Concerned about the, uh -- the witch-killing spell... ...or that I'm gonna mess these trials up?

DEAN
Look, we get too far down the road with this, we can't go back,

[ SAM chuckles softly ]
And it'll be too late for me to jump in.

SAM
Who says that you're gonna have to? You know, maybe I'll actually pull this one off.

DEAN
I'm just saying.

SAM
I know what you're saying, Dean. You've said it. You know, I've been going over this and over this, asking myself "why doesn't he trust me?" And it occurred to me, finally. It's not that you don't trust me.It's that you can only trust you.

DEAN
Are you done?

SAM
Yeah,
I'm done if you're done.

DEAN walks back over to the table and picks up an empty bottle.

DEAN
You know, once I get this put together, we can't hesitate. If we got to use it, we use it.

SAM
You mean if we find the witch that's doing this to James?

DEAN
Or if there is no other witch.

SAM
Or… it wouldn't be the first free pass we've given, Dean.

DEAN
Look, I like James as much as the next guy, but people are getting ganked here. Besides, Benny, Kate -- they were forced to be what they are. James chose this.

East St. Louis Police Department - Day
[ Siren wails ]
Sam is walking through the police station with a man in a white coat.

SAM
Vics were all torn up pretty bad.

MAN IN WHITE COAT
Like someone shredded them with their bare hands.[ MAN IN WHITE COAT Laughs ] Like that could happen. Ed? Ed Stoltz. He's lead on the case. Special Agent Keith.

SAM
Josh here tells me you don't have a lot to go on.

ED
Yeah. Isolated parts of the city, vics who meant nothing to nobody, so...

SAM
Right. Well, uh, my partner and I had a look at the crime scenes.

ED
Things really must be slow at the Bureau. [ ED Laughs ] Locations have already been knocked down.

SAM
Well, we did manage to find this piece of fabric. Things get overlooked. It happens. Why don't you run the blood? It could be the vic. It could be the doers. Let's see if we get a match.

Sam hands the fabric to ED and ED hands the piece of fabric, which was taken from the shirt that JAMES showed DEAN and SAM, to Josh, the man in the white coat.

ED
A witness did mention seeing a man in a suit and a white shirt leaving the area, so --

SAM
You didn't mention a witness in your report. Anything else?

ED
No. We'll get back to you on the lab work. So if that's all –

SAM
Sure, but this witness --

ED
That's all that was said, Agent Keith. We really don't have a lot here, okay? We'll be in touch.

ED walks away from SAM.

SAM does his usual half smile that means he isn’t happy and walks off irritated.
Witch Nightclub - Day
[ Jazz music plays ]
DEAN and PORTIA walk down a long flight of steps to the club.

DEAN
Am I getting the stink eye in here or what?

PORTIA
They can tell you're an outsider.

DEAN
Are they all witches?

PORTIA
And stuff. But if there's information out here about James, they'll know.

DEAN
How did James find you, anyway?

PORTIA
Not the way it works. The familiar finds the master, and they become inseparable.

DEAN
Guess a lot of people feel that way about their pets.

PORTIA turns sharply to look at DEAN.

DEAN
What?
[ PORTIA Scoffs ]

PORTIA
I'm not James' pet.

DEAN
Well, not all the time.

PORTIA steps toward DEAN and pushes him in the chest.

PORTIA
Not ever. The master and the familiar -- there's an unbreakable bond, like a melding of souls. We would die for each other.

MAN
Portia.[ Snaps fingers ] Over here.

PORTIA and DEAN walk over to the man who is sitting in a chair.

PORTIA
Dean, meet Phillippe LeChat. Dean's a wiccan from Detroit.

PHILLIPPE
Really? Well...Sit, sit.

PHILLIPPE points to the couch across from him and DEAN and PORTIA sit at the same time next to each other.

PORTIA
Spencer here?

PHILLIPPE
Somewhere.

[ DEAN sneezes, clears throat ]
PHILLIPPE smiles.
[ DEAN Sniffles ]

DEAN
That's weird. That only happens around cats.

PHILLIPPE
Tell me about James. Lot of buzz out there.

PORTIA
All gossip. The community has a little attitude going.

[ PHILLIPPE Chuckles ]

PHILLIPPE
He brings it on himself. The whole cop thing -- witch cop -- is he nuts?

DEAN
I said the exact same thing.

PHILLIPPE
Then there's you, babe. It isn't done, Portia, and you know it.

DEAN
I'm sorry. Uh, remind me, what -- what isn't done?

SPENCER walks up.

SPENCER
Portia.

SPENCER looks at Dean so DEAN feels the need to explain himself.

DEAN
Uh, I'm a -- I'm a wiccan. I'm from Detroit.

PORTIA
Spencer's the man to ask.

DEAN
Oh, okay. Uh... You ever heard of a-a spell where a witch can control the actions of another witch?
[DEAN Sneezes ]

SPENCER
No, I never heard of a thing like that. I don't think it's possible.

SPENCER looks at PORTIA with concern.

SPENCER
How's James?

PORTIA
Better. I'll tell him you asked.

SPENCER
Philippe, it's time we were going.

PHILLIPPE
Of course.

PHILLIPPE looks at PORTIA.

Good night.

PHILLIPPE then looks at DEAN mockingly as his eyes change to cat eyes and his face becomes catlike .

PHILLIPPE
So nice to meet you.

DEAN nods as PHILLIPPE turns completely into a black cat. Surprising DEAN.

[ PHILLIPPE Purrs ]
[ PHILLIPPE Meows ]
PHILLIPPE climbs up on a table that is next to the couch he was sitting on and his master SPENCER holds out his hand while PHILLIPPE nuzzles it.
[ Meowing ]
[ Purring ]
SPENCER walks off camera with PHILLIPPE.

DEAN
I knew it.

[ Deans’ Cellphone rings ]

DEAN
[ Sniffles ]
Excuse me. (to PORTIA)

DEAN (speaking into cellphone)
Yeah.

SAM (speaking into cellphone at the hotel room)
Where are you?

DEAN
Some witch bar. Why?

SAM
Listen, I just got the lab work back from the blood on James' shirt.

DEAN
And?

SAM
Not good. Blood's an exact match to victim number three.

DEAN
Well, that pretty much says it all, doesn't it?

SAM
Yeah.

James’ bedroom- Night
PORTIA attaches shackles to JAMES’ right ankle[ Shackles click ] PORTIA then moves up and begins shackling JAMES ‘right wrist. As the camera pans up you see his left side is already shackled.

PORTIA
I hate doing this to you.

JAMES
It's okay. Really.

PORTIA
We don't have to. You know, they won't find out.

JAMES
Portia... If I believe I'm innocent, I have to do the right thing. And if I'm not innocent, I have to do the right thing.

PORTIA lies on the bed next to JAMES and puts her head on his shoulder.

PORTIA
[ Sighs ]
Tell me one day this will be over.

PORTIA lifts her head up and smiles as she looks into JAMES’ eyes.
PORTIA
I love you.
PORTIA and JAMES begin kissing and PORTIA moves over JAMES and straddles him while they continue to kiss. The scene continues to show them kissing and PORTIA caressing JAMES. Suddenly PORTIA has a vision and in the vision [ JAMES Grunts ] PORTIA sees everything JAMES has been seeing in his dreams and she looks terrified when she sees the different people being murdered.
[ WOMAN Screaming ]
_____________________________________________________________________________________
JAMES’ House - Same Night
DEAN and SAM quietly break in the front door and walk into JAMES house. DEAN walks in first. The brothers walk down the hallway that leads to the bedroom as DEAN pulls out the concoction from BOBBYS witch killing recipe that they put together at the hotel. It looks like a clear flask filled with blood and has a piece of cloth stuffed in the top of it for a cork. They slowly open JAMES’ bedroom door and DEAN walks inside first. JAMES is lying on the bed with his eyes closed but his eyes open as SAM and DEAN move closer to the bed. JAMES does not become upset even though he seems to know what is about to happen. DEAN clicks his zippo and sets the flame. He brings the flame closer to the cloth sticking out of the bottle as Portia steps out of the bathroom located in the bedroom.

PORTIA
No! No, Dean! You have to listen to me, please. It's not James!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
PORTIA James and I were close, without psychological walls -- intimate.

DEAN I don't --

SAM They had sex.


DEAN
Wow. [ Chuckles ] I, uh -- I didn't expect that.

PORTIA
We have an unusual relationship. Familiars aren't supposed to be sexually involved with their witches.

DEAN
Understandable, you know, considering that you're a... ...well, and that he's... That's –

[ DEAN chuckles ] DEAN looks to SAM.

DEAN
Little help here?

SAM shakes his head no.

DEAN
No?

PORTIA
James and I -- we hadn't made love in weeks. His agony ate him up, and he shut me out. But tonight, I saw his thoughts -- memories of the murders.

DEAN
I'm sorry, is this you trying to talk us out of ganking James or --

PORTIA
Dean, that's all I saw -- just the kills. No preparation, no thought process, no anticipation, no motive. Just the kills without context.

SAM
No other awareness of the crimes?

PORTIA
No. Doesn't that at least suggest he's under another's control?

DEAN
Spencer said that wasn't possible.

PORTIA
He said he'd never heard of it. James is chained. He's confined. At least take a shot.
[ PORTIA Sighs ]

East St. Louis Police Station- Day
Sam walks through the police station and stops at a hallway and looks to his right.
[ Door opens ]
A door opens and JOSH and ED walk out. Josh is holding a thick file in his left hand. SAM walks down the hallway to the two men.

SAM
Gentlemen.

ED
Still investigating this crappy little case? I'm awed the Bureau has so much time on its hands.

SAM
Right. Well, we have some, uh, individual discretion to pursue cases.

As SAM is talking he looks down at the file and sees the name FRAMPTON, JAMES next to a case number typed on it.

JOSH
I'll catch up later, Ed.

ED
Yeah, but at some point, cases like this go cold, as I'm sure you're aware. Just not enough to keep them floating -- that's all.

SAM
Sure. No new leads, then?

ED
No. And it's drifting towards the back burner, really. We just don't have the manpower.

SAM
Then it must have been tough to lose a valuable resource like Lieutenant Frampton. See, he and I -- we, uh -- we caught a case together a while back.

ED
Well, he's not lost to me. He's -- he's on leave.

SAM
I remember he said he was the youngest guy here to ever make lieutenant. [ Chuckles ] Must have made a few waves.

ED
Nah. This place is run like a dogsled -- no stars. Just grunts. One mutt goes lame, another one pops up and slogs through the slush. Agent.
ED walks off leaving SAM looking like he is wanting to ask more questions. Once ED rounds the corner SAM turns and tries to open the door JOSH and ED walked out of.
[ Door handle rattles ]
The door is locked.

[ Engine rumbling ]
DEAN and PORTIA, in the Impala, drive through a large garage that seems abandoned. DEAN parks the car
[ Engine shuts off ]
and they both get out [ Car doors close ] and proceed to walk around to the back of the car.

DEAN
So this, uh, warlock we're meeting -- he's -- he's a snitch?

DEAN and PORTIA walk to an open garage door as they talk.

PORTIA
Cops have snitches all over town. James uses Drexyl when he suspects someone in the community.

DEAN
I got to ask. I-I can't help but wonder --

PORTIA
Which came first, dog or girl?

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm just curious as to which one you consider yourself, mostly.

PORTIA
This have anything to do with what I told you about James and me last night? How you're imagining it?

DEAN
What? No, that's.. .[ DEAN Chuckles ]Yes.
[ Vehicle approaches ]
Am orange gremlin with one brown stripe down each side drives through the open garage door and stops just feet from where DEAN and PORTIA are standing.
[ Engine shuts off ]
The driver opens the car door gets out and shuts the car door. He calmly walks over.

PORTIA
Drexyl, this is Dean.

DREXYL
Wiccan, Detroit. I heard. So, here's the deal -- absolutely no word on the street about any witchhexing another one.

DEAN
You sure there's not any kind of spell?

DREXYL
Look, Detroit, I pride myself on reliable sourcing. There is, however, a lot of chatter about our James.

PORTIA
What kind of chatter?

DREXYL
That he's gone ripper.

DEAN
As in Jack the --

DREXYL
Someone's circulating the rumor that he's set at full kill.

PORTIA
"Someone"? One of us?

DREXYL
If the cops get wind of it, arrest James, find out what he really is, that exposes the rest of us. You know that can't happen.

DEAN
Meaning?

DREXYL
They're gonna give James two choices – leave or the full hara-kiri.

DEAN
Suicide?

DREXYL
Witches appreciate a grand gesture.

PORTIA
I won't let him do that.

DREXYL
Well, the community might do it for him.

DREXYL walks back to his car.
[ Car door opens, closes ]

JAMES’ House - Day

[ Door opens, closes ]
Sam walks into the living room where DEAN is sitting on the couch.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN
Hey.
So, I have been going over Bobby's data.

SAM
Anything?

DEAN
Uh, Portia might not be wrong. Turns out there is a spell for, uh -- for implanting images into another person's brain.

SAM
Really?

DEAN
Yeah. Uh, "Creating false memories into another witch's mind."

SAM
Wow. [ SAM Chuckles ] So James could be convinced he killed those other people without ever touching them. So, then, maybe it is somebody else.

DEAN
Yeah, who's going to a hell of a lot of trouble to make it look like James. What'd the cops say?

SAM
Here's the thing.um, according to Ed Stoltz, they got zip, but they got something. I saw the, uh, tech guy who's working the case, and he had a huge file folder marked "James Frampton""

DEAN
Ed didn't mention that.

SAM
No, he did not. All right. [ Clears throat ] Oh, by the way, got to hand it to you. It's been 15 hours since Portia mentioned her night with James, and not one bestiality joke outta yah.
[ DEAN Chuckles ]

JAMES
Portia tells me my friends in the community want me burned at the stake.

DEAN
I'm not gonna lie. It's, uh -- it's getting ugly.

SAM
Yeah, the cops may have more on the case than they're saying, including a thick dossier on you.

JAMES
Me?

SAM
Yeah. I get the feeling whatever they have is under lock and key at the precinct, uh, room C-110.

JAMES
Then we need to break in.

DEAN
Sure, yeah. A locked room in a joint crawling with cops 24/7 -- why didn't I think of that?

JAMES
Dean, a witch can go to a place without having to go to a place.

DEAN
What, like phone sex?

JAMES
Astral projection. I can project my awareness anywhere...

DEAN
Ohh.

JAMES
...from the comfort of right here. But these have got to go.

DEAN
Not gonna happen.

JAMES
Irons on, no magic. No magic, no break-in.

[ DEAN Sighs ]

SAM
Okay. But only if we can go with you.

DEAN and SAM sit on either side of JAMES on the end of JAMES’ bed. PORTIA is standing in front of them.
PORTIA
James, are you sure you're still even able to do this?

DEAN
Oh, well, that's a confidence builder. Anything else I should know before I become some disembodied thing, completely at his mercy?

JAMES
Just close your eyes.

JAMES places one hand one DEANS shoulder and the other hand on SAMS shoulder.

JAMES
Whatever I see, I'll pass on to you, too. Libera me occulta cognoscere veritatem.

After JAMES speaks the words in Latin the camera starts zooming though the police precinct.
[ Indistinct distorted voices ]
The images are fast and blurry as JAMES directs the vision to the room SAM said he saw ED and JOSH come out of. Once inside the room they see that a huge case is being brought against JAMES and that ED is leading it. There are pictures and case files on the walls and they see ED looking at a witness statement signed by PHILLPE LeCHAT whom is SPENCERS familiar. The vision ends suddenly
[ JAMES, DEAN and SAM Breathing heavily ]
JAMES jumps up and away from the brothers.

DEAN
James, why don't you give us a little warning you're gonna snap us back like that?

JAMES
Stoltz -- he's building a case against me.

PORTIA
What?!

JAMES
Ed -- he's always wanted a breakthrough case. Nailing a renegade cop -- that would qualify.

SAM
Yeah, especially one he holds a grudge against.

JAMES
My first case -- they dropped him as lead detective. They went with me.

SAM
So what is this, you think -- a payback?

PORTIA
He can't just arrest you. He needs evidence. He needs proof.

JAMES
He's got it! He's got everything.

PORTIA
From who?

DEAN
Phil. The cat.

PORTIA
Philippe.

JAMES
[ Breathing heavily ]

SAM starts to stand up from the bed.

SAM
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

DEAN
James, hey.

SAM
Talk this out, buddy.

[ JAMES Grunts ]
JAMES throws a hand up and DEAN flies through the air and over the bed and into the night table on the left side of the bed.

[ JAMES Grunts ]
JAMES throws his hand up again and SAM flies through the air and hit a lamp and night stand on the right side of the bed.
[ JAMES Grunts ]

PORTIA
James, don't! We'll do this together.

JAMES
No, we won't. It's not safe for you. Our time together is over.

PORTIA
Standing by you is my duty, my choice!

JAMES
Portia, the ceiling is coming down on me. You still have a life.

PORTIA
Please.

JAMES
Portia, go.

PORTIA
James --

JAMES
Go!
JAMES pushes PORTIA and she starts to cry as she shakes her head and walks out of the room.

Witch Nightclub – Day
PHILLIPPE and another man are standing at the bar talking casually.

PHILLIPPE
So, you don't think it's too late for me to wear braces?

MAN
Won't even notice them. We'll put in transparent.

JAMES comes up behind PHILLPPE and picks him up and flips him onto his back on the bar.
[ PHILLIPE Groaning ]
PHILLIPE looks very scared and confused.

PHILLIPPE
James, what are you doing?

JAMES
Why are you telling lies about me?

PHILLIPPE
I'm not. I wouldn't.

JAMES
I saw the evidence room. I saw the police sketch based on an eyewitness account.
[ Chair scrapes ]

JAMES hears a chair scrape behind him which causes him to look over his shoulder he sees the man PHILLIPPE was talking to when he grabbed PHILLIPPE.

JAMES to MAN
Get lost.

The MAN puts his hands up and walks away calmly.

PHILLIPE to JAMES
Please, don't.

JAMES turns his head back to continue talking to PHILLIPPE.

JAMES
Tell me why.

PHILLIPPE
I had no choice.

JAMES
What does that mean?

PHILLIPPE
My master made me.

JAMES
Liar. You're a coward and a liar. Spencer's my friend.

PHILLIPPE
A direct command. Please, don't hurt my face.

JAMES
I'm not interested –

JAMES starts to back away as PHILLIPS neck breaks completely to one side. JAMES starts to look as if he questions whether or not he did it by looking at his own hand.

SPENCER
He was always spineless.

JAMES looks up and to his left to where he heard SPENCERS voice come from and sees SPENCER standing a few feet away.

SPENCER
Now literally.

The music becomes intense as the scene breaks.

JAMES
It was you. You were behind all this?

SPENCER
I humbly accept credit.

JAMES
You made me think I was a killer. Ed Stoltz put you up to it. He found out you were a witch, tried to blackmail you.

[ SPENCER Chuckles ]

SPENCER
You're not using your thinking cap, Jimmy. It was actually crucial that he didn't believe in the occult. I'd say he's built quite a solid case, don't you?

JAMES
I don't understand.

SPENCER
Of course you don't. Neither of you ever considered my feelings.

JAMES
Portia? This is about her?

SPENCER
Can you imagine the insult when she chose you? I wanted her as my soul mate the moment I saw her.

JAMES
She was meant to be my familiar.

SPENCER
Oh, she's way more than familiar, isn't she? When she picked you as master,
I endured it. But when you two went all Bella and Edward, broke the code, put your passions before the community rules, well, the arrogance, the entitlement was too much. Your total ruination seemed appropriate.

[ Footsteps ]
Both SPENCER and JAMES hear footsteps approaching.

SPENCER
The wiccan from Detroit.

DEAN
So James didn't kill those --

SPENCER throws his arm up at DEAN and SAM and they both fly into the wall several feet behind them and then crash down onto tables below them.
[ both grunt ]
SPENCER smiles and then turns to look back at JAMES as JAMES throws an energy beam at him
[ JAMES Grunts ] pushing SPENCER back but not affecting him much more than that.
SAM is on the ground trying to recover while keeping his arms around his head.
[ SAM Groans ]

SPENCER
Seriously, you want to take me on?

[ Energy crackles ]
SPENCER sends his own energy beam straight into JAMES and then lifts him off the ground using his power.
[ JAMES Groaning ]

SAM and DEAN use the distraction to stand up and DEAN gets the bottle out of his coat that they the originally prepared for JAMES while SAM gets out a lighter.

SAM
Hurry.

[ Crackling ]

While still holding JAMES in the air SPENCER turns and puts a hand up and sends a beam into DEAN and SAM causing them to freeze in place.

SPENCER
It's not only James' head I can get inside.

The camera zooms in on SAMS face and you see the blue energy in his eyes that SPENCER sent into his body. Then you see SAM is having a memory flashback of when he grabbed Michael/Adam as he fell into hell. Then the camera zooms in on dean and you see the blue energy in his eyes as he remembers his Mom and she is calling out to him and then she bursts into flames. Then the scene switches back to SAM burning in hell. The scene switches again to DEAN being chained in hell and calling out to SAM. Then SPENCER refocuses his attention back to JAMES who seems to be in terrible pain floating in the air. SPENCER is smiling. PORTIA is then seen running in in her dog form and she pounces on SPENCER. When SPENCER hits the ground his hold releases on everyone. SAM and DEAN then continue to get the flask with the witch killing potion inside of it as SAM recites the phrase needed to go along with the potion.
SAM
Ego voco impetu delere...

...vos caelum et infernum.

After SAM completes the phrase he lights the cloth that is in the bottle that DEAN is holding. DEAN then tosses the bottle at SPENCER and hits him directly in the stomach with it. A swirl of smoke engulfs SPENCER as he turns into blood and ash and poofs.
PORTIA, now in her human form, is lying on the ground but she starts to sit up as JAMES who was also on the ground gets up and comes over to her and cups her face in his right hand.
The camera switches back to SAM and DEAN.

DEAN
Well, kids, don't try this at home.

Sleepy Lodge Motel - Night
DEAN, SAM, PORTIA and JAMES are standing outside the brothers hotel room next to their cars.

DEAN
You sure you don't want to stay and fight this?

SAM
Look, we can help you.

JAMES
Eh, Spencer was right. Ed Stoltz has built enough of a case against me to make life hell for a long time, and the community here wants no part of us.

PORTIA
We start over. We're used to it. It's the way it's always been, for all of us.
I'll miss you. (to SAM)

PORTIA looks at DEAN and smiles slyly

PORTIA (to DEAN)
Maybe even you.

DEAN
I like dogs.

PORTIA
No. You really don't.

PORTIA gets in JAMES’ car in the passenger seat as he closes the door. JAMES starts to walk to the other said and once he passes PORTIAS’ window she is a dog again.

[ PORTIA Whining ]

JAMES gets into the driver’s side of his car.
[ Car door opens, closes ]
[ Engine turns over ]
JAMES and PORTIA drive off.

Impala: Driving Down Wet Dark Road- Night


DEAN
Well, it's possible I was wrong.

SAM
What, about James? Dude, we were both ready to gank the guy.

DEAN
No, that's not what I meant. Back there, when Spencer had us. He screwed with my head. I saw mom... When she died... And then some other crap.

SAM
Yeah. Me, too.

DEAN
You know, when I look back at what our family's been through, what everybody's been through, seeing all that pain... I realize that the only way we've made it through it all is by hanging together. I trust you, Sammy. With this deal, locking those sons of bitches up in the furnace once and for all, it's too important not to. So if you say you're good... ...then that's it. I'm with you 100%.

[ SAM Coughs ]

SAM
I'm good.
[ Coughing ]
SAM has blood on the corner of his mouth that he coughed up. He wipes it off and says nothing.
[ Sniffles ]
[ Clears throat ]
SAM looks around worried.
