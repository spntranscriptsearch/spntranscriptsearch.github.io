NOW

[exterior, Castiel is standing beside a tree on the short of a lake, mountains in the distance, and a blue sky above. He turns around and faces a small cottage by the lake, then walks toward it.]

[interior: Kelly Kline sits on the floor, a half-finished mural painted on the wall beside her, looking upward]

KELLY: God, please. I need help.

SVEN [on phone]: I'm trying to help you, ma'am.

KELLY: Are you, Sven? Because if you ask me if I have the quarter-inch Allen wrench one – one more time, I am going to come down there and burn your giant Viking junkyard of a store to the ground! Do you understand?!

SVEN: Are you sure it wasn't in the box?

KELLY: God! [she tosses the phone away in exasperation]

CASTIEL: Kelly. I told you I'd put this together. I'm very good at following instructions. And you need to rest.

KELLY: No, I don't.

CASTIEL: Kelly –

[Cas helps Kelly to her feet]

KELLY: No, Cas, I don't. I can't. I don't know how long until... I don't know how long I have left. And I...I'm never gonna be able to teach him how to ride a bike or watch him get married or even look him in the eyes. But I can build him a stupid Swedish crib! I can do that.

CASTIEL: Kelly, I know how hard this is. [Kelly gives Cas an incredulous look] That's a lie. I have no idea how hard this is for you. But I promise you... I will do everything. I will give my life for your son. And I will raise him. And I will make him someone you will be proud of.

KELLY: I know.



[interior, the bunker library]

DEAN: Okay, let me just get this straight. So... we beat the Brits, we kicked their psycho, tea-swilling asses, and instead of popping champagne and headin' to Vegas, we get Lucifer. MARY: And you're sure it's him?

SAM: Yeah. That's his old vessel, too.

MARY: How is that possible?

SAM: Crowley, I guess.

MARY: And now he's dead.

DEAN: Well, that's what Hess said. But Crowley's a freakin' cockroach.

[video cuts to a scene of the woods from above, and a rat.]

DEAN: (vo) I'll believe he's gone when I see the body and burn it.

[video zooms into the rat's eye, and a flashback of Lucifer attacking Crowley with an angel blade in 12.22, and Crowley's red smoke leaving his vessel and entering the rat before Lucifer "kills" Crowley]

LUCIFER: This is gonna hurt.

[back in the woods, the red smoke leaves the rat and enters Crowley's body in his grave. Crowley's hand burst up from the ground, followed by the rest of Crowley.]

[return to the bunker library]

SAM: We don't need Crowley. We need Rowena. I mean, she's the one who can slam Lucifer back into the Cage.

MARY: Great. So where is she?

[Sam calls Rowena, and we see her phone ring with Scotland Forever, then a pan out around a bloodied and tossed hotel room, a charred body on the floor. A man twirls a lock of Rowena's hair and picks up her phone.]

LUCIFER: Oh, hey, Sammy.



TITLE CARD

ACT 1

[interior, the bunker, Sam on his phone, realizing it's Lucifer]

DEAN: What?

[Sam puts the phone on speaker so Dean and Mary can hear]

LUCIFER: Oh, if you're looking for Rowena, she is presently indisposed. Which is a delicate way of saying, I stomped on her face till the white meat showed, and then set her on fire, just in case. Ah. Gingers. It was messy and... screamy, but it had to be done, Sam. [Lucifer picks up Rowena's voodoo doll that Dean played with in 12.11] I'm about to be a dad. Can't raise the little nipper from a jail cell now, can I? Speaking of... you know where your little pal Castiel is?

SAM: Go to hell.

LUCIFER: Ooh! Good one. Witty. I'll use that in the future. All right, well, I'd love to chat with ya, but, uh, why waste my time, right? It's not like you matter. I don't need to put on the old Sam suit anymore, do I?

DEAN: You know, if you think we're just gonna let you walk –

LUCIFER: Oh, hey, Dean! I know you fellas are gonna try, you know, whatever. Whatever you're gonna try. But you can't kill me. You've never been able to kill me. And with, uh, witch bitch gone, you can't put me back in the Cage, so like I said... you don't matter. Okay? Buh-bye. Buh-bye.

[Lucifer hangs up the phone and drops it next to Rowena's body]

LUCIFER: [to Rowena] Bye, dear.



[exterior, Cas and Kelly are unloading multiple large boxes of diapers from his truck at the lake house]

KELLY: I'm just saying, the checkout guy looked at us like we were super weird.

CASTIEL: Ah, you'll get used to it.

KELLY: Okay, but...Cas, I mean, you went a little overboard.

CASTIEL: I disagree. I have read 74 books on child rearing, and there is one thing that they all agree on– everybody poops.

KELLY: Well, you're not wrong.

[Kelly clutches her stomach and braces herself on the truck bed.]

KELLY: I'm fine. I'm... I'm fine.

[Cas helps her into the house, but unbeknownst to them, her hand leaves behind a smudge of golden glowing energy on the truck, which floats off and around to the back of the cottage]



[interior, bunker library]

DEAN: You know, Lucifer's right. We can't kill him and we can't slam his ass back in the Cage.

SAM: Yeah. Okay. So maybe we play for time. Find Cas and Kelly, keep 'em moving. If Lucifer can't find them, he can't hurt them.

MARY: You think Castiel is gonna go along with that?

DEAN: You think we'll give him a choice?

[shot of Cas watching Kelly in Jack's nursery, then return to the bunker]

MARY: And the baby?

SAM: Hopefully, we can still siphon off its grace. If not, uh... we'll figure something else out.

DEAN: Yeah, we better.

MARY: All right, then. Kind of always wanted to punch the Devil in the face. So how do we find them?

[shot of the exterior of the lake house, Cas exits the back door, then back to the bunker]

SAM: All right, look, we know Kelly's gonna have that kid soon. Like, really soon. And according to the lore, whenever a nephilim is born, there are signs. Uh, storms, outbreaks of disease, uh, plague of locusts.

DEAN: Things get Biblical.

[shot of Cas standing outside the lake house, then back to the bunker, then to Kelly painting in Jack's nursery, then Cas outside squinting at something unusual, then back to the bunker]

SAM: Exactly. That much power into the world, whenever and wherever it happens, things get weird.

MARY: So we're looking for something...weird.

[shot of Cas walking determinedly toward the lake, and we see the golden energy standing in a column in the yard]

DEAN: Yeah. Story of our lives.

[Cas studies the golden energy, then reaches out and touches it. It zaps him to a dark, cloudy, war-torn landscape with red lightning and giant spikes protruding from the ground]

CASTIEL: Where... How...

[Cas is attacked by a horned monster, and an unknown figure shoots the monster, which glows and sparks out like a demon struck with an angel blade. Cas rolls out of the way as the dead monster collapses in death and the unknown figure advances toward Cas, and Cas looks up at him, shocked.]

CASTIEL: You?



ACT 2

[interior, Jack's nursery, Kelly is recording a video of herself]

KELLY: Hi, Jack. It's, uh... I'm your mom. I know you're gonna be okay. You are gonna be... amazing. You have an angel watching over you. God, I love you, Jack. I love you so much. Sorry. I love you.

[Kelly stands up and gasps in pain, clutching at her stomach]

KELLY: Oh.

[exterior, the golden rift throbs, growing brighter in time with Kelly's contraction. Back inside, Kelly recovers.



[interior, the bunker library]

DEAN: Hey, listen to this – two-headed calf was born in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho. That's weird.

MARY: That is weird.

SAM: Yeah, but not our kind of weird. Look, whatever this thing is gonna be, it – it's gonna be big and bad–

CROWLEY: You rang? Hello, boys.

DEAN: [punches Crowley and holds the demon knife to his throat] Did you do it? Did you let Lucifer out?!

CROWLEY: I didn't "let" –

DEAN: Don't!

CROWLEY: Moose, a little help here!

SAM: Dean, wait.

DEAN: Seriously?

MARY: Seriously?

SAM: Look, just don't kill him. He worked the Cage spell with Rowena. Maybe he can help us.

MARY: And what if he can't?

SAM: Well, then we kill him.

CROWLEY: Cage spell? Thought you had mother for that.

DEAN: Rowena's dead.

CROWLEY: Really?

SAM: Yeah, really. Lucifer.

CROWLEY: Funny. I always thought I'd be the one to kill her.

SAM: Crowley...why did you do it? Save Lucifer– What did you want?

CROWLEY: I wanted to win. I perverted mother's spell, put Lucifer in a vessel of my own making because I wanted to win. You have any idea how many people have made a play for my throne over the years? Lucifer, Abaddon, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Too damn many. I thought if I could put the Devil on a leash... my own personal nuke, no one would ever dare challenge me again.

DEAN: Yeah. That worked out great.

CROWLEY: All ended with me narrowly escaping death by hiding in a rat.

MARY: Wait. In an...actual rat?

CROWLEY: Wasn't too bad, really. Gave me time to think. You know, I've been focused for so long on keeping my job. Never realized I hate it. All those whining demons, the endless moan of damned souls, the paperwork! I mean, who wants that?

SAM: You.

CROWLEY: Unh-unh. Once, maybe.

SAM: So why are you here?

CROWLEY: Well, whenever there's a world-ending crisis at hand, I know where to place my bets. It's on you, you big, beautiful, lumbering piles of flannel. So if you'll forgive my transgression, I'll make it worth your while.

DEAN: Which means?

CROWLEY: After we put Lucifer back in his cage– together– I'll seal the gates of Hell. You'll never see another demon again, apart from, of course, yours truly.

MARY: You would do that?

CROWLEY: Why not? They stab me in the back, I'll happily stab them in the front, the sides, and right up their little black-eyed asses. So... we have a deal?



[interior, the lake house, Kelly is wandering room to room looking for Cas]

KELLY: Cas? Cas? Castiel?

CASTIEL: Kelly.

KELLY: Where were you?

CASTIEL: I, um... uh, nowhere. Um, is everything okay?

KELLY: No. The baby, it's... I think it's time.

[she has another contraction, and the rift flares brighter again]

KELLY: Oh, my God.

CASTIEL: Look at me.

KELLY: Oh, God.

CASTIEL: – Everything's gonna be fine.

KELLY: – Ooh.



[interior, the Bunker, everyone is researching while Crowley watches]

CROWLEY: This is what you do when I'm not here? Type?

DEAN: Yep.

SAM: Wait a second. I got something. Okay, two hours ago, there was a massive power outage in the Pacific Northwest.

MARY: Sounds like the right kind of weird.

SAM: Oh, yeah. Wait. They tracked the outage to an address in North Cove, Washington, to a house currently being rented by one James Novak.

DEAN: That's Cas. Let's roll.

CROWLEY: It's about time.

[Crowley stands up to leave with them, but Dean stabs the demon knife through his hand, pinning him to the table]

CROWLEY: Aah!

DEAN Think we're gonna trust you out there after what you pulled? Hmm? No. You stay here, you sit down, and you shut up.



[interior, the lake house, Kelly's in bed, in labor]

CASTIEL: You're all right. The pressure waves are still very far apart.

KELLY: "Pressure waves"?

CASTIEL: It's what they– it's what they called contractions in my doula class. I-I took it online. First-time mothers, labor can be 12 to 18 hours, sometimes longer. It... Although, given this is the child of Lucifer and a quasi-celestial being...

KELLY: They didn't cover that online?

CASTIEL: They did not.

[Cas gets up and goes to the window, glancing out at the rift, which is now glowing much more brightly]

KELLY: Cas? Thank you. For everything.

CASTIEL: Of course.

[the rift glows brighter]



ACT 3

[the Impala drives toward the mountains, and then we see Kelly in bed having another contraction. She grabs for Cas's hand.]

CASTIEL: Kelly.

KELLY: Tell me again. Tell me again what you saw.

CASTIEL: Right, I saw– I saw... [Cas closes his eyes and recalls the events of 12.19, Kelly taking his hand and the golden glow taking over him, his eyes glowing gold] I saw the future. I saw a world without pain or hunger or want. I saw the world that this child... that your child...

KELLY: Mm.

CASTIEL: ...will create.

KELLY: Mm.

CASTIEL: And it is a world without fear and without suffering and without hate.

KELLY: Mm.

CASTIEL: I saw paradise.

[the lights flicker and then Cas hears the Impala pull up outside and goes downstairs to investigate, armed with his angel blade]

CASTIEL: Dean?

SAM: Cas, is this place warded?

CASTIEL: Yes, heavily.

DEAN: Heavy enough to stop Lucifer?

CASTIEL: Lucifer?

MARY: He could be right behind us.

CASTIEL: I don't... What are you doing here?

DEAN: Saving your ass.

SAM: You and Kelly just taking off was a stupid move. But there's no way we're letting Lucifer get his hands on that kid. It ain't happening.

DEAN: Look, Sam's right, okay? We'll work through our crap. We always do. But right now, we are here to get you, get Kelly, and get gone.

CASTIEL: She can't be moved. She's having a–

[Kelly groans in pain from upstairs]

MARY: I'll check on her.

CASTIEL: How much time do we have?

SAM: We don't know.

DEAN: Hey, if he shows, can you flame on again? Can you torch Lucifer like you did Dagon?

CASTIEL: I don't know. No, that wasn't me. That was the child. And in case you haven't noticed, he's a little busy.

DEAN: [bends and grasps his injured knee] Aah. Son of a bitch.

CASTIEL: Here, Dean.

DEAN: Mm.

CASTIEL: Let me.

[Cas taps Dean's forehead and heals him]

DEAN: Thanks.

SAM: All right, we should double-check the warding.

[Sam walks toward the back door and Cas turns to follow him]

CASTIEL: Wait.

SAM: Right. So listen, if we, uh...

[Sam steps out the back door and sees the rift]

SAM: Cas? What is that?

CASTIEL: It's a tear in space and time.

DEAN: Uh, and that means?

CASTIEL: It's a doorway to another world.

DEAN: Anoth– What, like Narnia?

CASTIEL: No. No, through there it's Earth, but...but different. It's a– it's an alternate reality.

[Cas leads Sam and Dean toward the rift]

SAM: So it's a Bizarro world? Or – or like the place we got zapped to where we were, uh, uh, actors on a TV show.

DEAN: Oh, yeah. The supernatural wasn't real.

SAM: Yeah.

DEAN: And you were Polish.

SAM: R-right.

SAM: Wait, Cas, how did this get here?

CASTIEL: Well, the child being born, his power, it seems to be puncturing the fabric of our universe.

DEAN: Awesome.

SAM: Yeah. And what exactly is on the other side?

CASTIEL: You don't wanna know.

DEAN: Probably. But we need to.

[Cas brings them through the rift into the alternate universe]

SAM: Whoa. Cas, what is this?

CASTIEL: As I said, it's– it's Earth. But this Earth is locked in eternal war between Heaven and Hell. There are armies of angels fighting hoards of demons, and the few humans that remain are caught in between.

SAM: How do you know that?

CASTIEL: A friend told me.

DEAN: Oh, good. Now you're makin' friends? That's... All right, on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is this?

SAM: I don't know. I gotta say, a, uh, hole in reality to a bombed out Apocalypse world? I'm gonna go with 11.

DEAN: Sounds right.

CASTIEL: You don't have to worry. The child, he opened this door. He'll close it.

DEAN: You sure about that?

CASTIEL: I have faith.

Really? In your unborn baby-God?

CASTIEL: Yes.

DEAN: Well, then, you're a dumbass.

[A hooded figure moves through the mist toward them, and Sam pulls his gun]

SAM: Guys. Guys!

DEAN: Hey! Hands in the air!

CASTIEL: No. Don't.

[Cas stops them, and the figure removes the scarf covering his face]

SAM: Bobby?



ACT 4

[exterior, the alternate universe]

BOBBY: Do I know you?

SAM: Bobby... Sam. Dean. Cas.

BOBBY: Uh-huh. You say that like it's supposed to mean something to me, but...naw.

CASTIEL: Sam, this is Bobby, but it's not your B–

DEAN: Bobby, it's us. Sam and Dean Winchester.

BOBBY: The only Winchester I ever heard of was John.

SAM: Yeah. John Winchester, our father.

BOBBY: Doubt it. He's dead. Been dead over 40 years now. Only reason I know about him is this Hunter I ran with, Mary Campbell. You get a few pints of shine into her, and she always told the same story about the man she loved– John Winchester. Azazel killed her about 10 years ago.

SAM: Cas, what the hell is this?

CASTIEL: This is a world where you were never born. It's a world you never saved.

[Sam and Dean look around at the death and destruction]



[interior, Kelly's room]

KELLY: Aah!

MARY: Okay. I think they're less than five minutes apart now. It's almost time. How you doin'?

KELLY: I'm dying.

MARY: I know.

KELLY: But that's okay. 'Cause wouldn't you die for your sons?

MARY: Yeah.



[exterior, the Alternate Universe]

BOBBY: When this... whatever opened up, all sorts'a alarms went off back at my place. I got here just in time to see your boy get ambushed by a tempter demon.

DEAN: A what?

CASTIEL: It's, um... black eyes, pointed teeth, horns.

SAM: Wait a second. Demons have horns now?

DEAN: Whole new world, Sam.

BOBBY: Usually I gun down flyboys on sight. But, uh, he looked... different. Wasn't wearing a necklace made out of baby ears, for one thing.

CASTIEL: We got to talking about where I came from and our two worlds.

BOBBY: From what he says, pretty much peaches and cream on your side.

DEAN: Oh, I wouldn't say that. It's better than this.

BOBBY: Well, I don't know. Ain't so bad here, if you like killing angels.

SAM: And you do?

BOBBY: It's my hobby and my passion. So...I figured, it's only a matter of time before the dicks upstairs get wind'a this. And when they show... me and Rufus go to work. He's loaded with a hundred rounds, cast from old angel blades.

DEAN: Wait, angel-killing bullets? Awesome.

[Cas shoots Dean a glare, Dean doesn't consider it quite as awesome]



[interior, Kelly's room, she's having another contraction and grasping Mary's hands]

MARY: Okay. Okay. You're okay.



[Sam, Dean, and Cas return through the rift]

CASTIEL: Are you all right?

DEAN: No, Cas. Pretty far from all right. I mean, we've got Lucifer on this side, we've got Mad Max World on that side. I mean, yeah, we've been down before, but this? I-I mean, I don't even know where to start.

[Crowley appears in the yard]

DEAN: Oh, come on!

CROWLEY: Hello, boys. Again.

SAM: Wait a second, how the hell did you –

CROWLEY: [holds up his bloody, bandaged hand where he removed the knife] I improvised. Lucky I did. Turns out I'm the answer to all your problems.



[interior, Kelly's room. Mary's holding her hands when Cas knocks at the door]

CASTIEL: May I speak with her?

MARY: Sure.

KELLY: Mary.

MARY: I'll be back.

KELLY: Okay. Cas... what's wrong?



[interior, downstairs. Dean readies their weapons and hands Sam his gun]

DEAN: You ready?

SAM: Nope. When has that ever stopped us?

DEAN: Yeah. You know, Cas has faith in this kid.

SAM: Mm.

DEAN: I hope he's right. But me? I have faith in us. You, me, Mom, Cas. And Crowley. Sometimes.

SAM: Mm.

DEAN: This is gonna work. It has to.



[interior, Kelly's room]

CASTIEL: Don't worry. It will be fine. [Cas stands up and kisses the top of Kelly's head]

Remember– paradise.



[exterior, the front yard of the cottage, Lucifer walks up to Sam, Dean, and Cas]

LUCIFER: Well... this is a fun surprise. I gotta hand it to you guys. You never give up, even when you should. Even when it would be so stupid not to.

SAM: Look, whatever you're planning on doing, Chuck...God will stop you, just like he did last time.

LUCIFER: You're right. What should I do? Oh, God! Don't strike me dead! Come on, Sam. You sound like a virgin in Jesus camp. "We can't. God is watching." No. Chuck "walked." He's gone.

DEAN: So you're just gonna smash his toys?

LUCIFER: Exactly. 'Cause every time I look at this sad trash fire of a world, you know what I keep thinking? I could do so much better.

DEAN: So Apocalypse, take two. That's your plan?

LUCIFER: When in doubt, go with the classics. That's what I always say. Well, boys, enough with the foreplay. Let's do this.

DEAN: See you on the other side, boys.

[Cas charges at Lucifer with his angel blade, but Lucifer bats him aside. Cas doesn't get up]

CASTIEL: Aah!

LUCIFER: Well, that worked.

[Sam and Dean look at Cas, then each other, then take off running around toward the back of the house]

LUCIFER: Mature. Real mature! [Lucifer strolls around the house after them] You guys? I really want to enjoy this. Really wanna savor just ripping you apart, gettin' all up in there, and gettin' all gooey. But, you know, little slugger's almost here and, uh... Well, I'm on the clock.

[Lucifer sees Sam and Dean standing by the rift and stops, Dean reaches out and touches the rift, and he and Sam disappear into the alternate universe]

LUCIFER: Interesting.

[Lucifer follows them through the rift]

LUCIFER: Mm. Nice.

SAM: You wanted the Apocalypse? You got it.

LUCIFER: Sammy. Hey.

DEAN: Where's your big bro?

DEAN: Right here.

[Dean is pointing Bobby's angel killing gun at Lucifer]

LUCIFER: Ooh. Sweet toy.

DEAN: Yeah, I got it off an old– new pal of mine. See, we have this bet, see if it works against an archangel. So... say hello to my little friend.

[Dean opens fire on Lucifer while Sam runs off to where Crowley was hidden behind a rock, crafting a spell]

CROWLEY: Took you long enough.

SAM: Not now, Crowley. Come on.

DEAN: [still shooting Lucifer] Yeah, baby! Come on!

LUCIFER: Uhh!

[Dean's gun finally clicks empty]



CROWLEY: We do this ritual, we seal that rift, and we lock the Devil in this godforsaken place. That's the plan, remember? Two birds, one spell.

SAM: Right, right. Just hurry.

[Sam peeks over the rock to see Lucifer advance on Dean, grab him, and start hitting him]

LUCIFER: You lose.

[Sam crouches back down to help with the spell]

SAM: Uh, Dead Sea brine, uh, mercury, lamb's blood, holy oil. Here we go.

[Lucifer continues punching Dean]

SAM: That's the last of it. That's everything.

CROWLEY: No, it's not.

HOME: What?

[Lucifer switches to stomping on Dean and kicking him]

CROWLEY: If we wanna seal that rip, we need one more minor ingredient.

SAM: – What?

CROWLEY: – A life.

[Lucifer kicks Dean again]

LUCIFER: Ah, I could do this all day. You make such funny noises.

[Lucifer is flung away from Dean by an invisible force]

CROWLEY: Surprise.

LUCIFER: Crowley! [Sam rushes over to help Dean up, and pulls him back toward the rift] You sneaky little... So I guess I get to kill you twice, huh, Crowley?

CROWLEY: I doubt it.

LUCIFER: Oh, no, no. You had your chance. You could've put me back in the Cage, but... you had to make it personal, didn't you?

[Sam and Dean stop by the rift and watch Crowley and Lucifer]

CROWLEY: You're right. It is personal. You humiliated me. I... I hate you. Deeply. Truly. I'm gonna enjoy wiping that smug, self-satisfied look off your face. Personally.

LUCIFER: You mean...this one? [Crowley's lets his angel blade drop into his hand] Come on, Crowley. You know whatever you try, you're gonna lose.

CROWLEY: You're right. [he turns to Sam and Dean] Bye, boys.

[Crowley stabs himself with his angel blade, and falls to the ground, dead. Sam and Dean watch, stunned, as Cas barges through the rift and pushes past them]

DEAN: Cas?

SAM: No, come on. Come on!

DEAN: Cas! Cas! Cas!

SAM: No, no, no, no, no, no! We gotta go! We gotta go!

[Dean tries to stop Cas, but he advances on Lucifer with his blade drawn, while Sam drags Dean back through the rift]



[Kelly, delivering the baby, begins to glow and then an explosion of golden light knocks Mary across the room]

KELLY: I love you.



ACT 5

[exterior, the alternate universe, Cas advances on Lucifer and stabs him in the stomach with his angel blade. Lucifer's eyes glow red]

[exterior, the lake house at the rift, Sam and Dean get to their feet. Dean looks at the fading rift in shock, when Cas comes back through]

SAM: Cas.

[The rift flares behind Cas, and an angel blade pierces his chest from behind]

DEAN: No!

[Cas falls to the ground, revealing Lucifer standing behind him, holding the bloody angel blade]

LUCIFER: That was fun. Seriously, guys, points for trying. Super impressed, but, uh... playtime's over.

MARY: Get away from them.

LUCIFER: Mary, right? Yeah, I've heard about you.You, uh, are certainly living up to the hype.

Look, seriously, I just wanted to say thank you for everything. I owe ya, kid.

[behind her back, Mary activates the angelic brass knuckles and then takes a step toward Lucifer, until Sam tries to stop her]

SAM: Mom, Mom, Mom.

MARY: I love you.

[she punches Lucifer in the face]

Lucifer: Cute. Is that all you got, mama?

[Mary punches him again, and again, and he drops the angel blade beside Cas's body. She continues punching him, each blow lighting up the red grace beneath his skin. She punches him back toward the rift, and as he's about to fall through, he grabs her arm and pulls her with him.]

DEAN: Mom!

[The rift flares bright, and then disappears altogether]

MARY: Aah!

DEAN: – Mom, Mom! No!

[Lucifer and Mary land in the alternate universe, and the rift disappears on that side, as well]

LUCIFER: – No! No! No, no! No!

[Dean looks from the vanished rift over to Cas]

DEAN: No! No. No, no, no, no, no.

[Sam sees a glowing, flickering light inside the house, glances at Cas, and then runs toward the house]

[Dean stands over Cas, then drops to his knees, looking from Cas up to the sky, and then back to Cas]

[Sam finds Kelly's body in bed and closes her eyes, then follows Jack's scorched footprints to his nursery, and finds Jack sitting in the corner in the dark, his eyes glowing ominously golden]
