TEASER
INT. POLICE LOCKER ROOM

JERRY, wearing a t-shirt, is toweling his face after shaving. He sees a spot of blood on the towel and notices a nick on his left cheek. He rinses it off, but it persists.

JERRY
Oh, come on.

JERRY rubs his right cheek. A patch of skin peels off and lands in the sink.

JERRY
Ohh. Oh. [ Exhaling sharply. ] What the hell?

A second cop, ED, has been dressing in the locker behind.

ED
Come on, man. Let's get going.

JERRY walks backward from the mirror, breathing rapidly and leaving bloody footprints. Blood seeps through the back of his t-shirt.

ED
Jerry?

JERRY
[ Bleeding from the mouth. ] Ed, I think I'm bleeding.

JERRY falls forward. Blood splatters at ED's feet. The camera pulls back to reveal a mash of flesh and blood where JERRY used to be. ED is horrified.

ACT ONE
INT. DEAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Birds are chirping as morning light floods into a bedroom window. DEAN is sleeping. LISA wakens next to him.

LISA
Hey, you.

DEAN
Hey.

A light peck becomes a long and passionate kiss. DEAN is distracted by the sound of a heartbeat. A horn blares and DEAN wakens from his dream. He is alone in the Impala, parked just off a busy highway.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM is inside, shirtless, working through a fitness routine of push-ups and sit-ups. These scenes are intercut with:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

DEAN is by the side of the road, fully clothed, stretching to work the kinks out. The Impala pulls out and is back on the road.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM is doing chin-ups on a pipe suspended from the ceiling of the room.

A WOMAN emerges from the bathroom.

WOMAN
Don't stop on my account.

SAM
[ Laughs. ] I'm done.

WOMAN
Last night was a... [ clears throat ] high point, if you don't mind me saying.

SAM
Good.

WOMAN
All right. Well, I see you need to start your day. When did you say you were heading out?

SAM exhales, indicating impatience.

WOMAN
You didn't. Right. Damn, you know how to play that mystery card.

As she turns to leave, SAM clears his throat and holds up some cash.

WOMAN
Right. I almost forgot. Next time... [ gives SAM a note ] you can call me on my night off. If you want.

SAM
Okay.

WOMAN
Okay.

She leaves. The phone rings. SAM scrunches up the note and tosses it into a wastepaper basket. He picks up his cellphone.

SAM
Hey.

EXT. BURGER HEAVEN - DAY

DEAN
Hey. I'm about eight hours out of the Campbell Base.

SAM
Uh, change of plans. I need you to meet me. I'm in PA. Town called Easter.

DEAN
What are you doing in Pennsylvania?

SAM
Caught a case.

DEAN
A case? When? It's been like a day and a half.

SAM
I like to work.

DEAN
Apparently.

SAM
Glad we hashed that out. Call me when you roll into town.

SAM hangs up.

DEAN stares at his phone.

DEAN
Who died and made you boss?

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

A cop, TOBY, is parked on the side of a road. A car speeds by, clocking 70 mph.

TOBY
Well, now, you could do better than that.

He settles back to pour some booze into a giant-sized plastic convenience store cup. His cellphone rings.

TOBY
Why are you calling me? He's dead, right? That's it. Now, I don't want to talk about it. We do what we do -- we go to work, we go to the funeral. [ Sighs ] Calm down. This is nothing to do with you and me. You're just working yourself up. Don't call me. [ Hangs up. ] Idiot.

Something crashes through the branches toward the cop car. Boils break out on the TOBY's face and hands.

TOBY
God! God! Dispatch, this is -- Please, I -- I need... Please.

TOBY chokes and stills.

EXT. STREET - DAY

SAM is in a suit, is leaning against his car and reading some reports.

DEAN drives up in the Impala and exits it in the midst of a phone conversation. He is also in a suit.

DEAN
Ben...I know you're lying. Because I lie professionally, that's how. Now tell your mom that you broke the damn thing and take it like a man. Okay? Ok-- okay. [ Hangs up. ]

SAM
Wow.

DEAN
What?

SAM
You -- molding the minds of tomorrow. Who knew?

DEAN
Yeah, tell me about it.

SAM
How'd it go?

DEAN
With?

SAM
You and Lisa. How'd she take it when you bailed?

DEAN
Shockingly cool, actually.

SAM
Better for everybody.

DEAN
Yeah, I suppose. Still driving the plastic piece of crap, huh?

SAM
What's your mileage, again?

DEAN
Shut up.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

SAM briefs DEAN as they walk through the station to the morgue.

SAM
Officer Gerald Hatch, 17-year veteran, found dead in the ready room three days ago.

DEAN
[ Reading the file. ] Whoa. Somebody was over-hydrated.

SAM
[ Laughs. ] Basically, yeah. The guy just... liquefied. Most of the meat, bones, dense tissues -- they just turned to blood.

DEAN
Okay, I don't get it.

SAM
Nobody gets it.

DEAN
No. I mean, I get that. I'm saying, if the guy was a mop job, then what are we doing in the morgue? What's left of him to look at?

SAM
Not here to look at him. Here.

SAM opens a drawer, revealing the boils-covered cop.

DEAN
Ooh. Bad news.

SAM
Officer Toby Gray. They just brought him in. Found him dead in his patrol car, sitting at a speed trap on the outside of town.

DEAN
"Extreme allergic reaction."

SAM
Yeah. Boils. Covered from head to toe.

DEAN
Yeah, on the inside, too. It says his airways are chock full of them. This startin' to look a little witchy to you?

SAM
That was my first instinct, but I found zero signs of hexwork anywhere. Far as I can tell, witchcraft was not involved.

DEAN
There's got to be some sort of link between, uh, skid mark and bubble wrap here.

SAM
No question.

DEAN
All right, well, can I get a witness?

SAM
Yep. Uh... [ reads from notes ] Officer Ed Colfax. Saw Hatch go from a solid to a liquid.

DEAN
Another cop?

SAM
Hatch's partner.

SAM pushes the body back into its drawer.

EXT. STREET - DAY

SAM's car swings around a corner. DEAN's car pulls out in front of him and is first to park his vehicles at their destination in a leafy neighborhood.

SAM
Were you, uh... were you racing me?

DEAN
No. I was kicking your ass.

SAM
Very mature.

SAM and DEAN knock on the door of a suburban house.

DEAN
Hello? Officer Colfax?

The door opens to reveal ED in full dress uniform.

DEAN
Whoa. Lookin' sharp, Kojak.

ED
Who the hell are you?

SAM
We're the Fed, Ed. We're here to ask you a few follow-up questions about your partner's death.

ED
Don't worry about it. It's nobody's business.

SAM
Officer Colfax --

ED
Don't worry about it!

ED slams the door shut. Exasperated, SAM kicks the door in.

DEAN
Dude!

Walking toward ED's office, SAM and DEAN pass a wall of family photos with the faces scratched out. They find ED in his office, using a screwdriver to scratch out the face of his police portrait.

SAM
Officer Colfax?

DEAN
Hey, man, you all right?

ED
Don't worry about it.

DEAN
Right. Look, Officer Colfax -- Ed. We think that your partner died of unnatural causes.

ED scratches his hat.

DEAN
Did he have any enemies that you know of?

ED
You might say that.

SAM
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

ED
They both had it coming. Me too. I'll be the next to go, and then it'll be over. And God will be satisfied.

DEAN
Why does God want you all dead?

ED
'Cause of Christopher Birch.

ED knocks over a bottle of booze. He watches it spill for some time.

ED
Oh, damn it.

SAM
Who's Christopher Birch?

ED
He has no face.

SAM
Ed?

DEAN
Officer, you all right?

ED rights the bottle.

SAM
Who is Christopher Birch, Ed?

DEAN
Ed!

ED
Christopher Birch is a kid with no face... and a planted gun.

DEAN
Uh, you, uh... you got a little something...

Blood is dribbling from under ED's hat. ED puts his finger to it.

DEAN
...yeah.

ED
Damn. My head's been itching like a dirty jock.

ED falls forward. His face lands on the broken glass of the picture frame.

SAM
Ed?

SAM walks behind the desk and checks ED's neck for a pulse.

SAM
Dead.

[ Buzzing sound. ]

DEAN
You hear that?

SAM removes ED's hat. Locusts crawl out of a hole in ED's head.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

DEAN is seated at a table, looking through papers. SAM is at the other end, working on his laptop.

DEAN
Sweet. Blood, boils, locusts.

SAM
Three of your more popular Egyptian plagues.

DEAN picks up a jar containing the locusts.

DEAN
Yeah, but these guys... ate their way out of a cop's melon. I don't quite remember that in the King James.

SAM
Meanwhile, a kid named Christopher Birch was shot in the head last month after a vehicle pursuit. Hatch, Gray, and Colfax were the three officers involved, and they all filed the exact same police report.

DEAN
[ Reading a report. ] "Suspect exited vehicle brandishing a firearm. We were forced to fire."

"Just a kid with no face and a planted gun."

Bunch of dicks. So they pop the kid, plant the piece.

SAM
Maybe Colfax is right. You know, maybe heaven has a hate-on for bad cops.

DEAN
So we're listening to the guy with the bug in his custard? That's -- that's the, uh, the theory you want to go with?

SAM
Dean, angels got to have something to do, right, now that we're post-Apocalypse?

DEAN opens a beer.

DEAN
We should call Cas.

SAM
You're kidding, right? [ Scoffs ] Dean, I tried. It was the first and second and third thing I did, soon as I got topside. Son of a bitch won't answer the phone.

DEAN
[Sitting on a bed. ] Well, let's give it a shot. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray to Castiel to get his feathery ass down here.

SAM
You're an idiot.

DEAN
Stay positive.

SAM
Oh, I am positive.

DEAN
Come on, Cas! Don't be a dick. We got ourselves a... plague-like situation down here, and... do you...do you copy?

SAM
Like I said... [ clears throat ] son of a bitch doesn't answer -- he's right behind me, isn't he?

CASTIEL
Hello.

ACT TWO
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM
Hello?

CASTIEL
Y-yes.

SAM
[ Imitating Castiel ] "Hello."

[ Normal voice ] "Hello"?

CASTIEL
Uh, that is still the term?

SAM
I spent all that time trying to get through to you. Dean calls once, and now it's [ imitating Castiel ] "Hello"?!

CASTIEL
Yes.

SAM
[ Normal voice ] So, what, you -- you like him better or something? [ Scoffs ]

CASTIEL
Dean and I do share a more profound bond. [ To Dean ] I wasn't gonna mention it.

DEAN
Cas, I think what he's trying to say is that... he went to Hell for us. I mean, he really took one for the team. You remember that? And then he comes back without a clue, and you can't take five friggin' minutes to give him some answers?

CASTIEL
[ Strongly. ] If I had any answers, I might have responded. But I don't know, Sam. We have no idea who brought you back from the cage... or why.

SAM
So... it wasn't God?

CASTIEL
No one's even seen God. The whole thing remains mysterious.

SAM
What the hell does that mean?

CASTIEL
What part of "I don't know" escapes your understanding?

DEAN
Cas, look, if Sam calls, you answer. Okay? You wing your ass down here, and you tell him, "I don't know." Just because we have some sort of a -- a bond or whatever...

CASTIEL
You think I came because you called? I came because of this. [ Walks to table where Dean's research is spread out. ]

DEAN
Oh, well, it's nice to know what matters.

CASTIEL
It does help one to focus.

SAM
Wait, so -- so you and the Halo Patrol, you guys aren't the cause of these killings?

CASTIEL
No. But they were committed with one of our weapons. There's only one thing that could have brought this into existence. You call it the Staff of Moses.

SAM
The Staff?

CASTIEL
[ Picks up the jar of locusts. ] It was used in a dominance display against the Egyptians, as I recall.

DEAN
[ Scoffs ] Yeah. That one made the papers

SAM
B-but I thought the Staff turned, like, a -- a river into blood, not one dude.

CASTIEL
The weapon isn't being used at full capacity. I think we can rule Moses out as a suspect.

DEAN
Okay, but... what is -- what is Chuck Heston's disco stick doing down here, anyway? I mean, don't you guys put away your toys?

CASTIEL
Before the apocalypse, Heaven may have been corrupt, but it was stable. The staff was safely contained. [ Sighs ] It's been chaos up there since the war ended. In that confusion, a number of... powerful weapons were... stolen.

DEAN
Wait, you -- you're saying your nukes are loose?

CASTIEL
Yeah, I'm afraid so. But you've stumbled onto one of them. We must find the weapon that did this. [ Indicates the jar of locusts. ] I need your help.

SAM
[ Scoffs. ] That's rich. Really.

CASTIEL
[ Grunts, tosses the jar of locusts at SAM. CASTIEL performs air quotes during this speech. ] Sam, Dean, my "people skills" are "rusty." Pardon me, but I have spent the last "year" as a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent. But believe me, you do not want that weapon down here. Help me find it. Or more people will die.

DEAN
All right. Okay. Well, if the angels didn't pull the trigger, then that brings us back to motive.

CASTIEL
What?

SAM
Back to the case. Right now, we got three dead cops. Only thing linking them... is this. [ DEAN hands SAM a newspaper clipping. ] "Father of slain suspect calls for investigation."

INT. BIRCH FAMILY LIVING ROOM - DAY
Newspaper clippings are strewn on the coffee table. The camera pulls back to reveal DARRYL BIRCH intently reading a tabloid with a front cover story entitled, "POLICE OFFICER DIES AT PRECINCT."

[ A door slams, someone walks into the house. ]

AARON, a boy
Come on, dad. How many times are you gonna read that thing? You know what? We should just throw it away.

DARRYL
[ Mumbles, not looking up from the paper. ] Go out back and play.

AARON leaves, DARRYL begins to cut the story out of the paper. ]

SAM, DEAN and CASTIEL suddenly appear in the living room.

DEAN
Oh, Cas, a little warning next time.

DARRYL
What the... how'd you get in here?!

SAM
Mr. Birch, settle down. [ Shows FBI badge. ] Federal agents.

DARRYL
But you can't just walk in here!

SAM
[ Indicating the clippings. ] Quite a collection you've got there, huh?

DARRYL
What are you trying to --

SAM
Look, we know the truth, all right? Chris didn't have a gun on him when those cops shot him. They set him up.

DARRYL
Yeah. They're all getting theirs.

SAM
[ Accusational tone. ] And who's giving it to them, Darryl?

DEAN
Darryl? Did you kill Toby Gray and the others?

DARRYL
Me?! I didn't kill anyone! Look at how they died!

CASTIEL
You smote them with the Staff of Moses!

DARRYL
The hell kind of Fed are you?

CASTIEL
We don't have time for this. [ Steps up to DARRYL. ] Where is it?

AARON
[ Brandishing part of the Staff as if it were a gun. ] Leave my dad alone!

CASTIEL
Is that...? Yes.

SAM
Shouldn't it be bigger?

CASTIEL
Yes. It's -- it's been sawed off.

AARON
Leave him alone! It wasn't him!

DARRYL
Aaron, get out of here!

[ CASTIEL presses two fingers to DARRYL's forehead, DARRYL falls back onto the sofa, unconscious. ]

AARON
What did you do to him?

DEAN
It's all right. He's just sleeping.

AARON points the staff at DEAN.

CASTIEL teleports next to AARON, takes away the staff.

DEAN
Cas, take it easy! [ To AARON. ] Listen, we're not here to hurt you, okay? But we need to know... where did you get this thing?

AARON
Please don't kill my dad. It was me. I did it.

DEAN
Okay, nobody's killing anybody. What's your name?

AARON
Aaron. Aaron Birch.

DEAN
Okay, Aaron Birch, where did you get this?

AARON
You won't believe me.

DEAN
Try me.

AARON
It was an angel.

DEAN
An angel?

AARON
Those liars, they killed my brother, and nothing bad even happened to them. It's not fair. So I prayed to God every night he would punish them. God didn't answer. But he did.

CASTIEL
His name -- did he give you a name?

AARON
No. He just said I could have justice, but I was gonna have to take it myself. He... he gave me the stick.

DEAN
He just... gave it to you? Ah, come on. He didn't just give it to you, did he, Aaron?

AARON
I bought it.

SAM
You bought it? [ Chuckles. ] With what? What's your allowance?

DEAN
What did the angel want for it? What did you give him for it?

AARON
My soul.

SAM
You sold your soul to an angel?

DEAN
[ To Castiel. ] Can that even happen?

CASTIEL
It's never happened before. An angel's buying souls. That could explain why he cut the staff into pieces.

SAM
Why?

CASTIEL
More pieces, more product.

DEAN
More "product"? Who is this guy?

CASTIEL
We'll find him.

CASTIEL presses his fingers to AARON's forehead; AARON falls unconscious.

DEAN
What did you do that for?

CASTIEL
Portability.

Camera pulls back to reveal CASTIEL, carrying AARON over his shoulder, back in SAM's hotel room. CASTIEL places a still-unconscious AARON on the bed.

DEAN
Cas, you realize you just kidnapped a kid?

CASTIEL
If the angel we seek truly bought this boy's soul, when a claim is laid on a living soul, it leaves a mark, a brand.

SAM
What, like a -- like a shirt tag at camp?

CASTIEL
I have no idea. But I can read the mark and find the name of the angel that bought the soul.

DEAN
How?

CASTIEL
Well, painfully for him. The reading will be excruciating.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

CASTIEL
Dean.

DEAN
He's a kid, Cas. A ki-- Sam?

SAM
[ To CASTIEL. ] Any permanent damage?

DEAN
What?!

CASTIEL
Physically, minimal.

DEAN
Oh, well, yeah, then by all means, stick your arm right in there.

CASTIEL
Dean! If I get the name, I can work a ritual to track the angel down.

DEAN
And I'm all for that. But come on. There's got to be another way.

CASTIEL
There is no other way.

DEAN
You're gonna torture a kid?

CASTIEL
I can't care about that, Dean! I don't have the luxury.

CASTIEL pushes his hand into AARON's chest. AARON screams. DEAN advances. SAM holds him back. They watch as AARON screams and his body lights up from the inside. He stops screaming and falls unconscious when CASTIEL withdraws his hand.

CASTIEL
He'll rest now.

SAM
Did you get a name? What is it?

CASTIEL
I thought he died in the war.

SAM
What, he -- he was a -- he was a friend or something?

CASTIEL
[ Sighs. ] A good friend.

DEAN
Yeah, well, your frat buddy is now moonlighting as a crossroads demon.

CASTIEL
Balthazar. I wonder...

SAM
So we can find him now, right?

AN ANGEL appears.

ANGEL
Balthazar. Thanks, Castiel. We'll make good use of the name.

The ANGEL attacks CASTIEL with an angel blade. CASTIEL blocks it with his own.

ANGEL
And by the way, Raphael says hello.

The ANGEL and CASTIEL fight in the room until they both lose their blades. They grapple each other and jump through the window, falling several stories onto a car parked on the street. SAM and DEAN look out the window. The ANGEL disappears, leaving CASTIEL standing next to the destroyed vehicle.

SAM
My car.

DEAN
Okay. Silver lining.

ACT THREE
EXT. STREET - DAY

CASTIEL is standing by the wrecked car. SAM and DEAN are still up in the room.

CASTIEL
[ Now back in the room behind SAM and DEAN. ] He's gone.

SAM
Alright Cas, who was that guy?

CASTIEL
A soldier of Raphael. He must have followed me when I answered your call.

SAM
Raphael? The archangel? I'm sorry, what's going on here?

CASTIEL gets a bowl from a cupboard.

CASTIEL
I can explain later. Right now we have to --

DEAN
No, not later. Now. Stop, all right? Too many angels, Cas! I don't know who's on first, what's on second.

CASTIEL
What is "second"?!

DEAN
Don't start that.

CASTIEL
It is simple: Raphael and his followers, they want him to rule Heaven. I -- and many others -- the last thing we want is to let him take over. It would be catastrophic.

SAM
You're talking civil war.

CASTIEL
Technically, yes. Which is why we have to find Balthazar and his weapons before Raphael does. Whoever has the weapons wins the war.

CASTIEL pulls SAM's weapons bag from under his bed.

SAM
Help yourself.

DEAN
And what happens if Raphael wins? What -- what does he want?

CASTIEL
[ Gets a flask of holy water from SAM's bag. ] What he's always wanted -- to end the story the way it was written.

DEAN
You mean the Apocalypse, the one that we derailed?

CASTIEL
Yes. That one. Raphael wants to put it back on the rails.

DEAN
Why?

CASTIEL
I need myrrh.

SAM
Myrrh?

CASTIEL is no longer standing by the bed.

DEAN
Freakin' angels.

CASTIEL reappears behind DEAN. He is drawing on the kitchen table with chalk.

DEAN
Why does Raphael want to bring back all this crap?

CASTIEL
He's a traditionalist.

DEAN
Cas, why didn't you tell us this?

CASTIEL
I was ashamed. I expected more from my brothers. I'm sorry. Now I need your blood.

CASTIEL grabs DEAN's wrist and slices his palm.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa! Hey! Ahh! Why don't you use your own?

CASTIEL
It wouldn't work. I'm not human.

DEAN squeezes his hand shut. Blood drips into the bowl. CASTIEL adds myrrh and holy water and intones.

[ Sirens sound. ]

SAM
Uh, Cas, how long does this spell take?

[ Wailing intensifies. ]

CASTIEL
Got him. Let's go.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about him?

AARON is still lying on the bed, unconscious.

CASTIEL
Don't you think the police will take him home?

EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

[ Crickets chirping. ]

DEAN
Huh. I was expecting more Dr. No, less Liberace.

DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL advance on the mansion.

CASTIEL is in an opulent foyer. A frog perched on the balustrade of a grand staircase is croaking. CASTIEL teleports upstairs, follows loud music into a room with a piano and strobe lights. The door closes. CASTIEL readies his angel blade.

BALTHAZAR
Cas. You're here.

CASTIEL
Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR
It's so good to see you. He told me you were floating around.

CASTIEL
He?

BALTHAZAR
I believe you two have flown together. [ He turns on the lights and the music stops. ] Oh, you know, the old frog in the throat.

The body of the ANGEL who attacked CASTIEL earlier is on the floor. A frog jumps out of his mouth and croaks.

CASTIEL
Even I know that that's a bad joke. I grieved your death.

BALTHAZAR
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry about that, you know. I wanted them to think, you know, so... they wouldn't come looking for me?

CASTIEL What... is all this? What are you doing?

BALTHAZAR
Whatever I want. This morning I had a ménage à -- what's French for 12?

CASTIEL
You stole the Staff of Moses?

BALTHAZAR
Sure, sure. I stole a lot of things.

CASTIEL
You were a great and honorable soldier. We fought together.

BALTHAZAR
Yes, too many times to count.

CASTIEL
I know you. You're not some common thief.

BALTHAZAR
Common? No. Thief? Eh.

CASTIEL
I need your help.

BALTHAZAR
I know. I've been hearing all about you, and as far as I'm concerned, you and me, Cas, nothing's changed. We're brothers. Of course I want to help you.

CASTIEL
Thank you. I need the weapons.

BALTHAZAR
Don't ask that.

CASTIEL
Why take them? Why run away?

BALTHAZAR
Because I could! What? What? I me-- you're the one who made it possible. The footsteps I'm following -- they're yours. What you did, stopping the big plan, the prize fight? You did more than rebel. You tore up the whole script and burned the pages for all of us. [ Laughs. ] It's a new era. No rules, no destiny. Just utter and complete freedom.

CASTIEL
And this is what you do with it?

BALTHAZAR
Hey, screw it, right? I mean, dad's not coming back. You might as well blow coke and jump on the bed. You proved to me we could do anything, so I'm trying everything. What difference does it make?

CASTIEL
Of course it makes a diff-- it's civil war up there!

BALTHAZAR
I know.

CASTIEL
If we can beat Raphael, we can end this! Just give me the weapons.

BALTHAZAR
[ Laughs. ] Do you know what's funny about you? You actually believe that you can stop the fighting. It will never stop. My advice -- grab something valuable and fake your own death.

CASTIEL
You've gone insane. Your little holiday is over. Raphael knows you're alive by now.

BALTHAZAR
Oh, Raphael can try me anytime. I'm armed. I'm sorry, Cas. All else aside, I'm really, really happy to see you. Even though you still have that stick up your ass.

[ Thunder crashes. ]

BALTHAZAR
Was that you?

CASTIEL shakes his head.

BALTHAZAR
Oh, that's my cue then. Tell, uh, Raphael to bite me. [ Disappears. ]

Rear view of three ANGELS standing outside the mansion where SAM, DEAN and CASTIEL had stood before.

ACT FOUR
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

[ Thunder crashes. ]

RAPHAEL
Watch them. They're all snakes.

RAPHAEL and two angels walk toward the mansion.

INT. - BALTHAZAR'S MANSION

CASTIEL is alerted to some developments.

EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

An ANGEL armed with an angel blade is patrolling the grounds.

SAM
Hey, there. [ Produces an angel blade. ] Yeah, I got one of those, too.

ANGEL
[ Appears behind SAM, holding the knife to his throat. ] You think you can knife-fight an angel?

DEAN
Who's fighting? Peace out, douchewad.

DEAN slaps an angel-banishing sigil painted on the side of the house. The ANGEL disappears.

[ Thunder crashes. ]

INT. BALTHAZAR'S MANSION

CASTIEL
[ To a threatening ANGEL. ] You're making a mistake. Please. There is another way. Brother, please. I don't want to hurt you.

The ANGEL advances on CASTIEL. CASTIEL throws his knife into the ANGEL's chest. The ANGEL screams and vacates the body.

CASTIEL
Why won't any of you listen?

CASTIEL is grabbed from behind.

RAPHAEL
They don't listen, Castiel, because their hearts are mine.

RAPHAEL grabs Castiel by the collar and throws him back against a set of double doors that fall open. RAPHAEL kicks CASTIEL while he's down, then pulls him up to punch him several times. CASTIEL falls half-way down the grand staircase. RAPHAEL kicks him to the bottom and teleports there to punch CASTIEL again.

RAPHAEL
[ Raising an angel blade. ] Somehow, I don't think God will be bringing you back this time.

BALTHAZAR
Hey! Look at my junk. [ Holds up a glowing crystal. ]

RAPHAEL
No.

RAPHAEL turns to salt from head to toe. The salt clatters to the floor.

BALTHAZAR
[ Chuckles. ] Same thing happened to Lot's wife. Iodize the poor sucker, and your kitchen is stocked for life. [ Laughs. ]

CASTIEL
You came back.

BALTHAZAR
Well, now Raphael will have to go shopping for a new vessel. Should give me a nice long head start on him. Until next time.

CASTIEL
Next time.

DEAN
No time like the present. [ Flicks a lighter and drops it on a circle of holy oil that surrounds BALTHAZAR. ]

BALTHAZAR
Holy fire. You hairless ape! Release me!

DEAN
First you're taking your marker off of Aaron Birch's soul!

BALTHAZAR
Am I?!

DEAN
Sam?!

SAM
Unless you like your wings extra crispy -- [ uncorks a bottle of holy oil ] -- I'd think about it.

BALTHAZAR
Castiel, I stood for you in Heaven. Are you gonna let --

CASTIEL
I believe... the hairless ape has the floor.

BALTHAZAR
[ Laughs. ] Very well. [ Inhales, touches his clasped hands to his forehead, exhales. ] The boy's debt is cleared. His soul is his own.

DEAN
Why you buying up human souls, anyway?

BALTHAZAR
In this economy? It's probably the only thing worth buying. Do you have any idea what souls are worth? What power they hold? Now... release me.

DEAN
Suck it, ass clown. Nobody said anything --

CASTIEL lowers his hand, lowering the flames.

DEAN
Cas, what the hell?

CASTIEL
[ To BALTHAZAR. ] My debt to you is cleared.

BALTHAZAR
Fair enough. [ Sound of an angel in flight. ]

DEAN
Cas, are you out of your mind?!

CASTIEL disappears.

DEAN
Cas?! Oh, friggin' angels! Come on!

ACT FIVE
EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY

DEAN is rearranging weapons in the trunk of the Impala.

DEAN
Yeah, well I didn't realize I had this much stuff back here.

SAM
Well, I need some space. Kind of picked up some stuff along the way.

DEAN closes the false bottom on the weapons cache. SAM places his duffel bag on top. He notices a mask there and pulls it out.

SAM
What the hell is that?

DEAN
Oh, it's, uh, Ben's Halloween costume.

SAM
Wendigo?

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
[ Approvingly. ] Accurate.

DEAN closes the trunk. The camera pulls back to reveal that they are parked at the side of a creek. DEAN and SAM have a conversation leaning over the roof of the Impala.

DEAN
Hey, so, uh... are you okay?

SAM
Me? [ Chuckling. ] Yeah, I'm great.

DEAN
Really? 'Cause there's been a few times that you got me wondering.

SAM
Come again?

DEAN
Well, like where were you when Cas was, uh, giving the Holy Taser treatment to that kid?

SAM
I was right there.

DEAN
Really? 'Cause honestly, I felt like I was the only one raising a card.

SAM
Right. Uh, I mean, I was with you, but...I don't know. W-we needed the intel.

DEAN
Yeah, I know, but we tortured that kid to get it.

SAM
[ Sighs. ]

DEAN
I just didn't get the feeling that you -- that you even cared.

SAM
Y- you're wrong.

DEAN
Hey man, I'm just trying to figure this out because... something's different with you. You know that.

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

DEAN
Really?

SAM
Yeah. I mean... I've been hunting non-stop for the past year, kind of... kind of on the wild, you know? So, yeah, I suppose I'm a little rough around the edges.

DEAN
Yeah, I get that. I just don't think I'm getting the whole scoop. You went to hell, Sam. And believe me, I know what that does to a guy.

SAM
To you.

DEAN
What?

SAM
You know what it does to you. It -- it tortured you. You know? I think it still does. But, Dean... I'm okay.

DEAN
So you're saying, what, that -- that you're stronger than me?

SAM
[ Chuckling ] No. Just saying we're different.

SAM pauses, slaps the roof of the Impala and gets inside.

DEAN ponders, then gets into the car.
