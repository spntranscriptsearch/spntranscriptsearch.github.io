TEASER


[Episode opens with a long shot of a hallway in a Sheriff station. A deputy is hauling a struggling girl through the hall.]


DEPUTY FRANK

All right, Missy, calm down!


GIRL

Let me go!


DEPUTY FRANK

Calm down!


[DEPUTY FRANK locks her up in a cell and sits down at a desk.]


GIRL [yelling]

Let me out!


[The radio on the desk crackles to life]


VOICE ON THE RADIO

Hey, Frank, someone smashed the front window over at Dawson's Hardware – possible B&E. Need you to check it out.


DEPUTY FRANK

Yeah, copy that, but the bullpen's empty, and I got someone in holding.


RADIO

Sheriff's heading to the station now. They won't be alone long.


DEPUTY FRANK

Roger that. I'm heading out.


GIRL [from the cell]

Hey, don't leave me. Please.


[The deputy just looks at her as he heads out the door. The girl looks worried as she backs away from the cell door.]


[A little later, she is sitting on the floor of the cell. She hears a noise and she stands up to investigate. When she goes to look out the door a young man's face appears. She jumps in surprise.]


GIRL

Cody.


CODY

There you are, girl.


GIRL

How did you find me?


CODY

Come on. You don't really need to ask that, do you?


GIRL

A-are the others with you?


CODY

Everyone was off on a hunt when I'd realized you'd run away. Figured I'd do you and them a favor and come take care of this before they even know we're gone.


GIRL

You can't get me in here.


CODY [holding up keys and unlocking the door]

Cop sure was in a hurry to check out that "B&E" I faked. Barely even saw me coming. I keep telling you – you can run and you can hide, but we will always find you.


[CODY opens his mouth and a set of vampire teeth descend. But before he can jump the girl, he is decapitated from behind. Blood sprays in the cell. JODY MILLS is standing there with a bloody fire axe.]

ACT ONE
[Scene opens with the IMPALA pulling up next to a Sioux Falls Sheriff cruiser with JODY MILLS standing next to it. It is raining outside as the Winchester get out to greet the sheriff.]


JODY

You boys are a sight.


SAM

Jody. How's the shoulder?


JODY

Eh, only aches when it rains. How you boys been?


DEAN

Peachy.


SAM

Touch and go.


JODY

I know the feeling.


DEAN

So, what you got for us?


[JODY turns around and opens the truck of her car and the dead vampire lays inside next to his head. SAM looks quickly around and then bends down and presses his finger to the gum of the vampire. A vamp tooth pushes out.]


SAM

Yeah, uh, that's a vamp, all right.


DEAN

I don't know, Sammy. Looks like Jody might not need our help anymore.


SAM

Oh, they grow up too fast.


DEAN

Don't they?


JODY

Yeah, joke all you want. There's more where this came from.


DEAN

More?


JODY

My men brought in a runaway last night. There's no I.D. on her – nothing on her, actually, except for a bus ticket out of Nebraska. Total Jane Doe. She won't even give me her name. Girl's basically feral. She's got zero manners, didn't even thank me for saving her. Anyhow, this thing went to plenty of trouble to get at her. And to hear him tell it, the "others" will want her at least as bad as he did.


SAM

Sounds like a nest.


DEAN

Yeah.


JODY

Nest? I'm guessing that's not half as cute and cozy as it sounds.


DEAN

Oh, I'm afraid not.


[In the jail room, SAM is doing a gum check on the girl while DEAN looks on. When he finishes, SAM steps behind her and shakes his head at DEAN in answer to their unspoken question.]


GIRL

Wilson and Fisher? You two are FBI, then I'm Taylor Swift. That wasn't a dental I.D. It was a fang check. You're hunters.


DEAN

And you're alive because, uh, hunters trained the sheriff. I think the first words out of your mouth should be a thank you. So, who were you to this vamp, anyway? Hmm? What's so special about you? Is there a nest?


[As DEAN is asking the questions, SAM notices some scars on the girl's neck. He goes to look closer but she sees him watching and shrugs her shirt collars higher to cover them. Then JODY opens the door and pops her head in...]


JODY

Sorry to interrupt. We got a match on her DNA.


[In the hall outside the cell room.]


JODY

Annie Jones. Reported abducted outside of Kenosha in '06. Raised by an elderly grandparent. No living kin. You think the vamps are the ones who took her?


DEAN

Eight years is a long time for a human to live with vampires without getting killed or turned.


JODY

You're the experts, but there was something...familiar about the way this vamp talked to her.


SAM

Jody's right. And she had scars on her neck, feeding scars. Uh...They're layered, as if they'd been built on for years.


DEAN

So she's a blood slave. We've seen it before – vampires keeping people as pets, human feedbags. Sometimes these slaves...


SAM

Stay loyal to their captors.


DEAN

Yeah.


SAM

Right.


JODY

So...This girl's not talking 'cause she's got a case of...what? Vampiric Stockholm syndrome?


DEAN

She's protecting the nest.


[Back in the interrogation room]


SAM

So, you feel a debt.


DEAN

They gave you a home, raised you.


SAM

Annie, we get it. Loyalty is a very powerful thing.


ANNIE

My name is Alex.


SAM

No, it's not. Your name is Annie Jones.


DEAN

Those vampires stole you. They're monsters, Annie.


ALEX

Alex.


DEAN

And they didn't love you. They loved your blood. They fed on you.


ALEX

I fed them. My choice. My brothers – they brought me food when I was hungry. So when they struck out on a hunt, I fed them. They're my family.


SAM

Okay, you care about them, but, Alex... There's a reason you decided to run away.


ALEX

It was time... to move on and get out on my own.


DEAN

And how do you think that decision is gonna sit with the rest of the nest? One of them already pursued you. You think when the rest of them find out that you left that they're just gonna shrug and cut their losses?


SAM

You lived with them for years. They've tasted your blood. They have your scent down cold. I mean, how far can you run and for how long?


[A single tear runs down Alex's face]


DEAN

You didn't think this out, did you? What would happen, who might get hurt – your, uh, "brother," for one.


ALEX

His name's Cody. And she killed him. [motions to JODY who is looking on]


DEAN

Because of a choice you made. These are the consequences.


SAM

You got two options – them or you. And we can help you. We can keep you safe. But you have to help us.


DEAN

Where's the nest?


ALEX

I can't. After what's happened...Mama finds me, she'll kill me.


[ALEX is crying from fear as the Winchesters exchange looks with the sheriff.]


[Later, SAM is doing some research on the computer in the sheriff station. JODY stands by lost in thought as DEAN walks up with a fresh cup of coffee.]


DEAN

Mills, you okay?


JODY

No wonder she didn't thank me. That creep was her brother. I'm fine. You know, mostly, I'm just – I'm hung up on the name. Alex and Annie – they're so close already. Why'd they change it?


SAM

Okay, so, we know from her ticket that Alex hopped a bus out of O'Neill, Nebraska, right?


JODY

Mm-hmm.


SAM

Obviously, it'd be better to go in with a firm location, but the town ain't that big. There are no caves or other natural hiding places.


DEAN

All right, so go in, canvass it cold.


SAM

Well, I worked together a short list of possible nest locations. Uh, there's an empty fire station, four or five derelict homes. Nothing we couldn't hit in a day.


DEAN

Okay.

[The brothers get up to leave and JODY follows them]

You sure you're all right to babysit by yourself?


JODY

Oh, well, girl's a flight risk, not exactly friendly, but I think I can handle babysitting detail.


SAM

The station's been made. It might be worth heading upwind for a while. I mean, vamps are trackers.


JODY

Terrific.


SAM

Yeah.


JODY

Well, I've got an old family cabin outside of town.


DEAN

That'll work.


JODY

Okay. Well, shouldn't raise too many eyebrows, me being gone for a day.


DEAN

Maybe, but you, uh, sure you don't want backup?


JODY

You want me to enlist my men in a protection detail against vampires? Frank's still in the dark about what hit him last night. The guy still has nightmares about the barn episode of Walking Dead. They're good cops. They're not ready for this.


SAM

Jody, in your late-night reading, did you ever come across anything about Dead Man's blood?


JODY

Mnh-mnh.


SAM

It takes vamps down like a horse tranq.


JODY

I would not say no to some of that. I mean, not that I'll need it. You guys are gonna get the jump on these vamps and be back here before they even realize their kin's missing, right?


[The boys nod and head out]


[The scene changes to a shot of a Nebraska license plate on a pickup truck. The camera pans up to show a woman walking out of a bus station and locking up. She is on the phone.]


WOMAN

Well, it's not my fault. Well, Ralph didn't show up for work today. I had to pull a double shift. I'll be home soon.


[She hangs up and walks to her car. As she pulls her keys out someone steps up close behind her. She jumps a mile and swings around]


WOMAN

Connor, you scared the–


CONNOR

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snuck up on you like that. It's just, you haven't seen Alex around, have you?


WOMAN

Uh, your sister. No, I can't say I have. Sorry.


CONNOR

Huh. So you didn't sell her a bus ticket out of town?


WOMAN

Did I help your shut-in kid sister get away from her weird, scary-ass squatter family? Answer's still "no".


CONNOR

So you're saying Ralph lied to us? 'Cause he said...that you sold her a ticket...right before we killed him.


[The woman panics and turns and runs but doesn't get very far before another woman steps from the shadows into her path.]


MAMA

You calling my family weird? Oh, honey, you have no idea.


[MAMA bares her vampire teeth and the woman screams]


ACT TWO
[JODY and ALEX pull up to a cabin in the woods. As JODY parks, ALEX looks around without amusement.]


JODY

What? Too rustic for your taste? Well, I have a lot of great memories. Used to come up here all the time – first as a kid with my parents and then with my...

[JODY stops and clears her throat.]

Anyhow, it's a lot nicer than it looks from the outside.

[They get out of the car and walk towards the cabin]

F.Y.I. – The woods around here – really easy to get lost in if you don't know your way around. Me – I know them like the back of my hand.


ALEX

I got it. "Don't try running. You won't get far".


[Inside the cabin, JODY is unpacking groceries. ALEX is walking around the living room. She takes a crucifix off the wall]


ALEX

You know this doesn't work, right? On vampires? It's useless.


JODY

That's not why I have it.


ALEX

Mm.

[picks up a picture of JODY's family. JODY walks in from the kitchen]

This your family?


JODY

Yes.


ALEX

Where are they?


[JODY does say anything.]


ALEX

Oh. Dead.


JODY [taking the picture back]

You know, there are about a thousand more polite ways you could say that. I'll give you a pass on account of the whole raised-by-monsters thing.


ALEX

How'd they die?


JODY

Horribly.

You must be exhausted. I know for a fact you didn't sleep last night.


ALEX

I'm fine.


JODY

It's no problem. I can make up a bed.


ALEX

I'm fine!


JODY

Suit yourself.


[Scene changes to the Winchesters approaching a rundown house. They enter, searching with flashlights. The house is obviously being lived in as there are beds made on the floor with blankets and food in the kitchen.]


DEAN

This place is a foreclosure, right?


SAM

Yep. It is, just like the rest of them.


DEAN

Well, somebody's squatting here.


SAM

Blackout windows.


[Suddenly there is a sound of a loud machine from behind the house. The brother more to investigate. Camera pans to a woodchipper out back and a man is shoving dead bodies into the grinding jaws of the machine. DEAN approaches from behind]


DEAN

Hey! Hey, you need a hand with that? Oh. [Chuckles dryly as he points to the dead hand sticking out] I guess not.


[The vampire bares its teeth and makes a move towards DEAN but hasn't gone a step before SAM jumps in and cracks him over the head with a shovel.

Camera changes to the brothers and the vampire, named DALE, in the house. He is tied up as the Winchesters try to get information out of him.]


DEAN

You go out with the family, bring home a nice dinner. How did you get stuck doing the dishes?


DALE

We all have our roles to play.


SAM

Yours being destroying the evidence, yeah? Nice job. Ralph Hedges. Stacy Kepler. Any reason you targeted them?


DALE

Yeah. Hunger.


DEAN

And, so, the family's what? Out taking a nice after-dinner stroll?


DALE

Oh, I'm sure they'll be back real soon.


DEAN

What I asked was...[DEAN grabs DALE's hair and jerks his head so their faces are very close] Where are they?


[Scene changes to DEPUTY FRANK in the sheriff's office filling out paperwork. He jerks when a voice speaks across the counter]


CONNOR [standing there with MAMA and two other vamps]

Nice shiner.


DEPUTY FRANk

Can I help you all with something?


CONNOR

As a matter of fact...I think you can.


[Back in the rundown house, DEAN throws a punch right into DALE's stomach.]


DEAN

You don't want to talk. No skin off my back. 'Cause you see, a blood-sucking, body-chipping vamp – that's bad enough, but vamps...that kidnap kids... Well, I'm going to enjoy putting you down.


DALE

Of course. Oh, I knew this was about Alexis. I warned mama that girl would screw everything up for us one day.


SAM

"Mama"? As in one vamp turned you all?


DALE

Well, all of us but little sis. She was, uh, "too good to turn". Mama couldn't bring herself to, no matter what we said, no matter how bad Alexis got.


DEAN

Bad?


DALE

Let me guess. You never had a teenage sister. Dragging her heels, whining, near constant, about everything, but more and more about the blood, like she's somehow above it, like she's better than us 'cause she don't feed on people.


DEAN [darkly]

She is better than you, dumbass.


DALE

Her moping? That teenage crisis-of-conscience crap? It's annoying as hell, but it's just an act. When the chips are down, she'll always choose us over humans. I mean, how do you think we stayed off your radar all these years? Pretty, young, lost-looking thing like her? Irresistible, especially to the kind of man few people would miss. I mean, sure, we hunt sometimes for sport, but it's a lot easier and a lot safer to get delivery.


[*FLASHBACK* There is a small flashback to ALEX in a bar getting hit on by a creepy man. She smiles at him and they leave the bar together. Then they are in the house and the man starts to make his move]


MAN

Come on, sweetie. Aren't you gonna give me a name?


ALEX

It's...Ann.


MAN

Mm. Sweet Ann. You got any idea what I'm about to do to you?


ALEX

Yeah. I do. Nothing.


MAN

What the... Is this a party?


[ALEX's brother all walk in and they start to feed on the creepy man *END FLASHBACK*]


DEAN

She's your lure.


DALE

Best a vamp could ask for. And you better believe you don't get that good at it unless you enjoy it. In her own sweet way...Girl's as bloodthirsty as any vampire.


SAM [suddenly realizing]

Jody.


[Back in Sioux Falls, JODY is bringing in firewood when she realizes that ALEX isn't in the living room anymore. She goes on a hunt for her in the house and finds her sleeping in JODY's son's room. She goes to pull up the covers on her but she walks up and scares both of them. ALEX apologizes.]


JODY

I made you a sandwich. It's out there if you want it.


ALEX

Sheriff. My grandma?


JODY

I'm so sorry.


ALEX

No, it's – it's fine. I figured – it's been years, and she was old.


[SAM and DEAN are both on the phone.]


SAM [finishing his call]

You got it. Thank you.


DEAN [hanging up]

She's not answering.


SAM

I just ran the victims' names through local P.D. They both worked at the O'Neill bus station.


DEAN

So they killed them for Alex's location.

[DEAN's phone rings]

Jody?


JODY

Dean, what's up?


DEAN

Listen to me. The vamps knew that Alex went to Sioux Falls, okay? They're probably already there. We're on our way there next. But there's something else. There's something about Alex.


JODY [seeing headlights pull up to the cabin]

It can wait. They're here.


DEAN

What?


JODY

At the cabin. Now.


DEAN

We're on our way.


JODY

Hurry. [hangs up]


DEAN

She hung up.


SAM

We moving?


DEAN

Yeah. Meet you outside.


[DEAN walks back into the room with DALE and without even missing a beat, he beheads him in one downward stroke of the machete.]


[Back in JODY's cabin, she is rushing for ALEX's room but before she gets there someone flies in through the bedroom window and slides a dresser in front of the door. JODY gets there but can't get the door open. ALEX is screaming from the inside.]


JODY

Alex? Alex, come on. We got to go. We got to go.


ALEX

Jody, help!


JODY

Alex?! Alex! Alex!


ALEX

Help me! Help! Let me go!


[By the time JODY busts into the room ALEX and her captor have disappeared out of the window. JODY chases them outside as they shove ALEX into a truck. MAMA is sitting in the front. CONNOR is the one who is controlling the struggling ALEX. JODY runs for them but gets clothes-lined by another vamp. As he is about to take a bite out of her neck, MAMA yells from the car.]


MAMA

Come on, let's go!


CONNOR

Move it!


[The truck peals out as JODY lays unconscious on the ground]


ACT THREE
[The IMPALA pulls up to the cabin in the daylight and the Winchesters jump out, greatly concerned about the groggy JODY who is still laying on the ground. They rush to her.]


DEAN

Jody?


SAM

Hey, you okay?


DEAN

Whoa, whoa, whoa.


JODY [struggling to her feet with the boy's help]

Where's Alex?


SAM

You tell us.


JODY

They came and I tried to stop them.


DEAN

And you got knocked out. Well, happens to the best of us.


SAM

Just lucky you're alive.


DEAN

You think they went back to the nest?


SAM

Of course they did. Why wouldn't they? Question is – what are they gonna do when they find their brother dead?


DEAN

So we go back now.


JODY

Okay. I'm coming.


DEAN

Uh, Jody? Hey, hey. Whoa. Hold on. You're hurt.


JODY

I'm coming.


SAM

Jody, we can handle the nest on our own.


JODY

I don't give a fig about the nest. That girl was under my protection.


DEAN

Okay, that "girl" can't be trusted. She's a lure. She's a-a honey trap. She's been feeding people to those vamps!


JODY

I don't care. Whatever she did, she did because they made her.


DEAN

Oh, and that's a reason?


JODY

She's a kid!


DEAN

Yeah, a kid who's been playing vampire murder since before she was in braces.


SAM

Jody, he's right. A-at best her loyalties are...screwed.


DEAN

And how do you even know she wants to be saved? For the past eight years, she has been baiting the hook for an entire nest. She's got more blood on her hands than most monsters we kill.


JODY

Are you saying she's on your list?


SAM

No, we're not saying that.


DEAN

Well, not yet. Look, it sucks, okay? It does. But with hunting monsters comes harsh truths. This is a clean-up mission. It's not a rescue.


SAM

What is this even really about? You barely know the girl.


JODY [glares at the boys and moves to the car]

I'm coming. And if either one of you lays so much as a hand on Alex...You'll have to go through me.


[ALEX wakes up on a bed and before she can really take in her surroundings, MAMA speaks from the other side of the room.]


MAMA

Put up quite a struggle with Connor. Says you nearly took his eye out. Maybe that was just his excuse for knocking you out. You have any idea the mess you made? Hunters raided the place while we were out, tortured and killed Dale. Our home's been made. We're gonna have to move again.


ALEX

Mama, I-I never meant –


MAMA [coming to the bed]

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! We will all find our way. Things got screwy...but you're back now.


ALEX

Why? After everything, I thought that you –


MAMA

You thought what? That I'd hurt you? Kill you? I would never hurt you. Not my baby girl, not my sweet Alex. How could you even think that? Baby, why did you do it? Why did you run from us?


ALEX

I love you, mama. I do. I just – I couldn't take it anymore. The blood and the death, the sounds of their screams. I just... I can't do it anymore. And the way I feel afterwards, the guilt...I'd rather die than feel that way again.


MAMA

It's my fault.


ALEX

What?


MAMA

All of it. This is my fault. I should've turned you years ago.


[DEAN, SAM and JODY prepare to raid the run down house. They are down the road from the house]


JODY

Well, their truck's in the driveway.


SAM

So we're walking right into it.


DEAN

Well, we've faced worse odds.


SAM

Yeah.


DEAN

Jody. This is a raid, so tread lightly, stay close. Priority is clearing the nest. Alex comes second. You got it?


JODY [annoyed]

Got it.


[Back to MAMA and ALEX]


MAMA

It was so selfish. I wanted to watch you grow up. I kept putting it off. Don't you see? These things you've been feeling – all the guilt and suffering – those are human feelings. It ain't too late. I can take the pain away. And then we can stay together, as a family. Like none of this ever happened. Wouldn't you like that?


[DEAN, SAM and JODY enter the house and clear the first floor. SAM and DEAN go upstairs and motion for JODY to stay where she is. They start to clear the second floor but JODY hears groaning from downstairs and goes to investigate. Meanwhile, upstairs SAM walks back to DEAN and as DEAN turns around he sees CONNOR has a gun on SAM. DEAN grasps his machete.]


CONNOR [pushing the rifle into SAM's back]

Drop it.


[DEAN drops the blade to the floor and then gets 2x4ed in the head by another vamp. He collapses in a heap.]


[JODY is moving down the stairs trying to find the source of the groaning. She sees ALEX laying face down on the bed. She rushes over to her.]


JODY

Alex, come on. Come on, honey. We got to go.


ALEX

Go away!


JODY

We got to go!

[ALEX sits up and her eyes are ringed in a weird amber hue and her mouth is covered in blood.]

What did they do to you?


ALEX

I'm sorry, Jody. I made my choice.


MAMA [stepping from the shadows and punching JODY unconscious.]

She chose me.


ACT FOUR
[In the house, DEAN is laying unconscious on the floor as SAM is tied to a chair. CONNOR is holding a gun on him as he struggles.]


CONNOR

No, no, no. No. Unh-unh-unh-unh. Hell of a sight to come home to... Brother lying dead on the floor.

[He rams the butt of the gun into SAM's stomach. SAM groans in agony.]

No idea it was a Winchester that had done it. So...Which one of you was it? Which one of you took off my brother's head?! Was it you? Was it him? Pretty fitting – brother for a brother. This place has been a good home to us. But since you two had to come around and ruin it, we're gonna have to to hit the road and find a new one. And when we hit the road...we like to pack a lunch.


[CONNOR cuts some surgical tubing and picks up a bucket and moves towards SAM. SAM draws back when he figures out what CONNOR is about to do.]


[In the basement, JODY is strung up by her hands to the rafters. MAMA is going through all of JODY's weapons on the table.]


MAMA

Can't say you didn't come prepared.


JODY

Alex.


MAMA

Hey. Don't be bothering my girl. She's going through something, a process.


JODY

What did you do to her?


MAMA

Fed her my blood. She's on her way now. All that's left is to feed.


ALEX

Please, mama. Let her go. I already drank from you. Let her go.


MAMA

Made an impression on my girl, I see. Baby, this is the human half of you talking. After the change, this human – she ain't nothing to you. Clearly, Sheriff, you got issues, some hole in your life you're using my Alex to fill. I would say go and get a family of your own, but, well...you know.


JODY

Wow. That's pretty rich coming from the woman who stole Alex to begin with.


MAMA

I have fed her, clothed her, loved her going on nine years. You think motherhood's just about blood? You don't know the first thing about it.


JODY

Maybe not, but I know what it isn't. And it ain't about forcing her to be like you the second she becomes inconvenient.


MAMA [to ALEX]

Don't you see what she is trying to do? This hunter cop bitch is trying to turn you against me to save her own hide. Don't believe a word she says.

[MAMA kicks the side of JODY's knee and it crunches in a sickening pop. JODY screams]

She ain't your mother.


[Back upstairs, SAM's blood is draining from his arm into a second pint jar which stands next to an already full one. He is barely conscious.]


CONNOR

Tapped this keg. Get the short-hair one ready. Time to finish this.


[The other vampire sends a vicious kick into DEAN's back right above his kidney. DEAN still appears to remain unconscious. The vampire pulls DEAN's head but as soon as his hand grasp his hair DEAN flings out his left hand which holds a syringe of dead man's blood. DEAN buries the needle in the vampire's heart and pushes down the plunger. DEAN grabs the machete from the floor and faces CONNOR.]


[JODY is still gasping in pain but is putting the pieces together in her mind...]


JODY

Alex! Was that her name? You named her after someone. Was it your daughter? I couldn't figure out why you changed her name. I thought maybe you were ashamed of your theft, but you have no shame. You said that I was using her to fill a hole in my life, and you're right. I am. You are, too.


ALEX

Mama?


MAMA

I guess it takes one to know one. That Alex... She died a long time ago.


JODY

And it still hurts. You still feel it, the loss, the pain – like a stone in your gut. It hurts just a little bit less whenever she's near.


MAMA

You bitch.

[She leaps at JODY and starts to beat her face with her fist.]


[DEAN is facing off with CONNOR but CONNOR drives him to the wall with his machete to DEAN's throat. Suddenly DEAN's face changes and all you can see is pure anger and strength. DEAN pushes back and swings CONNOR around to the exact position. DEAN presses the machete to CONNOR's throat. DEAN's face is snarling, his eyes pure focus.]


DEAN

Look at me. Look at me, bitch!


[CONNOR glares back and DEAN completely gives into the snarl as he severs CONNOR's neck with the blunt end of the machete. Before he turns back around to face SAM, DEAN tries to get his feral start under control but in his eyes we can see a flash of fear. He then rushes to SAM to remove the tubing from his arm.]


SAM

Dean.


DEAN

Yeah, I know. You wouldn't have done the same for me.


SAM

No. Jody.


[The brothers rush for the basement.]


MAMA

Good news, lady cop. Whoever you lost... You're gonna see them again real soon.


[MAMA cuts JODY down and goes in for the kill but before she can finish it, ALEX empties a syringe of dead man's blood into her back.]


MAMA [falling to the floor]

Alex? How could you? You were my girl.


ALEX

I'm sorry, mama.


[JODY quickly moves to the table and grabs her machete. She goes over to MAMA and pulls back her head.]


JODY [to ALEX]

Don't watch this, sweetheart.


[DEAN comes down the stairs with SAM leaning heavily on his shoulder but as the reach the bottom, JODY decapitates MAMA.]


ACT FIVE
[Outside the house, SAM and DEAN are standing next to the IMPALA talking.]


SAM

Nice work back there. "Look at me, bitch"?


DEAN

Well, hey, you got another snappy one-liner, I'm all ears.


SAM

What I'm saying is – it looked to me like you were enjoying it. Maybe too much.


DEAN

And? Well, sorry for not putting on a hair shirt. Killing things that need killing is kind of our job. Last I checked, taking pleasure in that is not a crime.


SAM

Right, but...


[JODY approaches]


DEAN

How's things back at the station?


JODY

Well, they beat Frank up pretty bad, but at least they left him alive. He kept apologizing for spilling the beans about the cabin, but I told him that one's on me.


SAM

Well, speaking of apologies, um...We owe you a big one.


DEAN

We were wrong about the girl.


JODY

No. You were right – about me. My judgment was clouded. You know, working this case, it brought...feelings back. Feelings I've been trying to bury for years, you know, buried it under work, religion...even dating. We know how that worked out. But, you know, it was still there, you know, underneath. The grief. Don't know what that means for me, just that I've been – I've been fooling myself to think that I could ignore it. Anyway, thank you – for coming out, for curing Alex.


SAM

You don't need to thank us. I mean, you're the one who killed her sire, got her blood.


JODY

Sure it'll work?


DEAN

Well, speaking from experience, it'll be a rough couple of days, but...She should pull through. You sure you don't want us to stay?


JODY

I'm good.


SAM

After it's done, you know what to do with her?


[JODY smiles]


[Back in JODY's cabin in Sioux Falls, she walks into ALEX's room. She is tossing and turning on the bed.]


JODY

Don't get up on account of me.


ALEX

I'm – I'm hot.


JODY

Should I grab a –


ALEX

I'll just be cold again in a second. It's part of the cure, I guess.


JODY

You want something to eat?


ALEX

No, I'll just throw it up. But, uh, thank you. I want you to know that... When Mama offered, I just... I couldn't disappoint her again. I had enough to be ashamed of as it is. Jody, I-I've done things.


JODY

You don't have to explain. I know. Whatever you want from me, I'll give it. If you want, I'm here. But what you've been through the last 48 alone, losing your entire family, everything you've ever known or loved – no one can understand that.


ALEX

You can.
