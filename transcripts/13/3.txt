TEASER
OMAHA, NEBRASKA
[INTERIOR – PSYCHIC OFFICE – NIGHT]
[A woman, DEDE, adjusts a framed picture of herself and MISSOURI MOSELEY on the mantle. A bell rings in the shop and a man enters. She turns and appraises him.]
MAN
Hello?
DEDE
Sorry, I was just closing up.
[The man looks disappointed and he turns to leave, she gives him a look.]
DEDE
Oh, but, come in.
[The man looks unsure but turns.]
DEDE
Seems like something’s on your mind.
MAN
Yeah. A lot, actually.
[DEDE gestures for him to sit. They are both now seated at a table facing each other. DEDE is dealing tarot cards]
DEDE
So, what can I help you with?
MAN
Shouldn’t you know already? Sign outside says you’re psychic.
DEDE
I’m a psychic counsellor, not a mind-reader. I read energies, auras.
MAN
Can you read mine?
DEDE
Close your eyes.
[MAN closes his eyes and leans forward. DEDE holds her hands on either side of his head. The blue aura she sees turns red and the WRAITH’S true face is revealed. He stabs her hand, trapping it on the table. She screams.]
WRAITH
Can’t let you run away, especially now that I know.
[The WRAITH gets up and moves behind her. She struggles, crying and tries to beat him away.]
DEDE
No, no, please no.
[He restrains her and kisses her head.]
WRAITH
You’re the real deal.
DEDE
Please no, please don’t.
[The WRAITH pulls her head back by her hair]
WRAITH
Shut up.
[A spike comes out of his hand. DEDE trembles.]
DEDE
Please, you don’t have to. Please.
[The spike pierces the back of her neck and she screams.]
[TITLE CARD]
ACT ONE
[INTERIOR – BUNKER – NIGHT]
[DEAN is sitting in his room on his bed with headphones on. Numerous empty beer bottles are set on the floor near the bed. He adds another one to the pile. JACK is in another room in the bunker. He turns to the door as someone knocks on it.]
JACK
Who is it?
SAM (from outside the room)
Hey it’s me. Uh, Sam.
[SAM opens the door slowly carrying a laptop.]
SAM
Hey. Just checking in. You haven’t come out since we set you up. That’s fine, I mean it’s all been… pretty insane I’m sure. But, um… Anyway, I brought you something. Please, have a seat.
[SAM enters the room. JACK sits on the bed.]
SAM
Before you were born, your mom left you a message. I know you have a bunch of questions and hopefully this is the start.
[SAM hands over the laptop and a pendrive to JACK. JACK stares at the pendrive in confusion.]
SAM
Right, yeah. Here I’ll um… There you go. Just push this button, right here, whenever you’re ready.
[SAM plugs in the pendrive and moves to leave.]
JACK
Thank you.
[SAM waits in the doorway as the video begins to play.]
KELLY (on screen)
Hi Jack, it’s uh… I’m your mom. I guess I should tell you, um, I always wanted to be a mom. I’d play with dolls. I was that kind of girl and daydream about my baby.
[JACK is emotional on viewing his mother; SAM receives a call and moves away from the doorway where he has been watching JACK.]
SAM
Hello.
MISSOURI (on phone)
Sam Winchester? It’s good to hear your voice.
SAM
Missouri. Wow, it’s been uh…
[MISSOURI is outside. It is dark out.]
MISSOURI
I know, a long time. Sorry to be a stranger.
SAM
That’s alright, how are you?
MISSOURI
Honestly? I could use some help.
[MISSOURI is revealed to be outside the PSYCHIC OFFICE. There are police and emergency service vehicles outside. A gurney is being taken into the house.]
[INTERIOR – JACK’S ROOM, BUNKER – NIGHT]
[Jack is still watching the video KELLY left for him.]
KELLY (on screen)
Jack, don’t let anyone tell you who you’re supposed to be. Because who you’re supposed to be isn’t fate, it isn’t me, it isn’t your father. You are who you choose to be. And I know you’re going to okay. You are going to be amazing. You have an angel watching over you.
[INTERIOR – LIBRARY, BUNKER – NIGHT]
[SAM is sitting at the table on the phone. DEAN walks in with a questioning look.]
SAM
Yeah, yeah, no I hear you. Yeah, thank you Jody. Yeah.
[SAM hangs up the phone and looks bemused.]
DEAN
What’s up?
SAM
You’ll never believe this. I got a call from Missouri Moseley.
DEAN
Wow. What’s it been, like a decade?
SAM
More.
DEAN
How is she?
SAM
Not great. She said that she got out of the life for a while but something happened and she needed help with a case, so I put Jody on it.
DEAN
Why would you do that?
SAM
Because we need to stay here. We need to help Jack learn how to control his powers. Jody can handle this.
DEAN
Yeah, maybe she can. Or maybe she ends up dead because you wanted to skip out on her to babysit the antichrist.
[They exchange a look. SAM looks exasperated.]
SAM
Dean, we need him.
DEAN
No, don’t.
SAM
Mom…
DEAN
Don’t. You… If you want to stay here and Mr Miyagi this kid, knock yourself out. I didn’t sign up for that. So I’m going to go to work.
[DEAN walks off. SAM looks dismayed.]
[EXTERIOR – ROAD – DAY]
[The IMPALA is seen driving down the road.]
[EXTERIOR – PSYCHIC OFFICE – DAY]
[JODY is talking to an agent standing in front of a police car.]
JODY
I appreciate the favor. Thank you very much.
[JODY walks towards MISSOURI.]
JODY
I talked to him, everything’s okay. So the victim, Dede, was a friend of yours?
MISSOURI
My protégé, she was like a daughter to me. The closest of kin I had in my life these days.
[The IMPALA drives up to where they are standing.]
MISSOURI
I always did love that car.
[DEAN gets out of the IMPALA and walks towards the two women.]
MISSOURI
Dean Winchester!
DEAN
Missouri. Jody. I’m not sure which one to hug first. Hey.
[DEAN hugs MISSOURI at JODY’S sign.]
MISSOURI
Oh honey, I’m sorry for your losses.
DEAN
Ah leave it to a psychic to cut right through the small talk huh?
JODY
Come here.
DEAN
Hey.
[DEAN and JODY hug]
JODY
How’re you doing?
DEAN
Dandy.
[INTERIOR – PSYCHIC OFFICE – DAY]
DEAN
What’d the sheriff have to say?
JODY
Victim was found with a hole at the base of her skull and her brain’s… Sorry.
[JODY glances apologetically at MISSOURI.]
MISSOURI
You thinking what I’m thinking?
DEAN
Wraith?
[MISSOURI nods.]
DEAN
No forced entry.
MISSOURI
Excuse me, dears.
[MISSOURI walks to the front door and places her hand over the door knob. Her eyes are closed.]
DEAN (to JODY)
Missouri reads objects. It’s kinda her thing.
[MISSOURI sees a vision of a shadowy man which focuses into the WRAITH. She opens her eyes and walks back the room.]
MISSOURI
He pretended to be a customer, said he needed help. Dede always was a soft touch.
[MISSOURI closes her eyes again. She sees a vision of the WRAITH with his spike out.]
MISSOURI
He is a wraith. But he’s picked a up a taste for our kind.
JODY
He feeds on psychics?
MISSOURI
Yes, he does.
[Her eyes open now, she runs her hand over the table and brushes a blood stain on it. Her eyes close again and she sees a vision of a house. As she concentrates harder she sees DEAN at a gas station and the WRAITH.]
MISSOURI
Oh, oh.
DEAN
Missouri, Missouri, you okay?
[MISSOURI continues to see visions. She sees the WRAITH and then a man, JAMES, lying dead with his throat slit.]
MISSOURI
James!
[INTERIOR – STUDY, BUNKER – NIGHT]
[SAM and JACK are present. JACK is seated while SAM walks towards him with a pencil in hand.]
JACK
Train me. To what?
SAM
I’ve seen what you can do, Jack. You’re powerful, but you have to learn to control it. You know, to focus.
JACK
So I don’t hurt anyone, anymore.
SAM
Exactly. See this pencil? I want you to move it. With your mind.
[SAM places the pencil on the table in front of JACK.]
JACK
That’s it?
SAM
That’s it.
[JACK looks at the pencil intensely while SAM appraises him. He glances at SAM and SAM nods towards the pencil encouragingly.]
[INTERIOR – PSYCHIC OFFICE – DAY]
[MISSOURI is holding a phone, she calls a number.]
[INTERIOR – JAMES’ HOUSE – DAY]
[JAMES picks up the phone.]
JAMES
Hello?
MISSOURI (on phone)
James? Baby?
JAMES
Mom?
MISSOURI
I know. I’m not supposed to call, but this is important.
JAMES
Let me guess. You had a vision.
MISSOURI
Yes, you have to believe me. James something bad is coming. It’s coming for you and Pai….
[JAMES hangs up the phone. MISSOURI sighs and returns to where DEAN and JODY are waiting. She hands them a slip of paper.]
MISSOURI
I want you to go to Buckhead, Georgia. This is the address. My son James, he lives there with my granddaughter, Patience. This wraith, he’ll be coming for them. That’s what I saw.
DEAN
Alright well, let’s go.
MISSOURI
No, I’m… It… I just complicate things. James won’t have anything to do with me.
JODY
Why not?
MISSOURI
He has his reasons. I’ll just stay behind, say my farewells to Dede.
DEAN
No, I don’t like that at all.
MISSOURI
You don’t have to like it. You just have to do it. You save my family, you hear me, Dean Winchester?
[MISSOURI is pointing at DEAN. JODY glances at him. He looks at MISSOURI and nods.]
DEAN
Yes ma’am.
MISSOURI
Good. And thank you.
[INTERIOR – STUDY, BUNKER – NIGHT]
[JACK has his hand over the pencil on the table and is concentrating hard, trying to move it. SAM is watching him.]
JACK
I can’t. Nothing. I’m useless.
SAM
Alright. Jack, when you did use your powers, what was it like?
JACK
I don’t… It was like, breathing, blinking. It just happens.
SAM
Even with Asmodeus, that just happened?
JACK
No, he made me. It was like, like he was in my head.
SAM
Okay um, then uh… Imagine him doing that.
JACK
No!
SAM
No? Why not?
JACK
Because I don’t want to! It’s just… I can’t do this! And you keep staring at me, waiting!
[JACK is flustered. SAM looks at him and places his hand on the table.]
SAM
You know what, let’s take a break.
[SAM gets up and walks out of the room. JACK looks surprised. He turns in his chair to face SAM’S back.]
JACK
Really?
SAM (from the doorway)
Yeah, I’ll get some food. Just. You stay here, try to relax. When I get back, we’ll try again.
[SAM leaves the room. JACK turns back slowly to look at the pencil, immobile on the table.]
[EXTERIOR – PSYCHIC OFFICE – NIGHT]
[A man, WRAITH, walks towards the house in the dark. Inside, MISSOURI is standing near the mantle, looking through DEDE’S things. She takes some stones out of a roughhewn pouch.]
MISSOURI
My thematic gems.
[The door to the office opens and closes. A bell rings in the shop and the WRAITH enters. MISSOURI looks resigned and then scrunches her face up as the WRAITH comes to a stop a few paces behind her.]
MISSOURI
Hello.
[MISSOURI turns to face the WRAITH and walks towards him.]
MISSOURI
You can spare me. I know what you are and why you’re here.
WRAITH
Oh. And why is that?
MISSOURI
You’re going to kill me.
[They both look into the mirror on the wall next to them. The true face of the WRAITH is seen.]
WRAITH
Well then, I guess it’s time to, you know… Scream.
MISSOURI
No, there’ll be none of that. I’ve seen how this turns out. I run, you catch me, I die. I stay, I die. But this way my people, they’re going to murder your ass.
[The WRAITH lifts his hand up, brandishing his spike.]
WRAITH
You sure about that?
MISSOURI
I am.
WRAITH
You know this would be a lot more fun if you screamed.
[The music reaches a crescendo. The camera zooms into MISSOURI’S face.]
MISSOURI
Tough.
[The WRAITH lunges forward. We see the exterior of the PSYCHIC OFFICE and hear the sound of something being stabbed.]
ACT TWO
[INTERIOR – THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE A GYM, SCHOOL – NIGHT]
[We hear a whistle from the gym, a girl, RONSON, carrying a volleyball leaves the gym, looking disgruntled. She sees PATIENCE, carrying some books, coming up the hallway.]
RONSON
Oh hey!
PATIENCE
Hey.
RONSON
Where are you coming from?
PATIENCE
Library.
RONSON
Why’d I even ask?
PATIENCE
How was practice?
RONSON
Uh, heinous. Coach kept riding my serve, says we, oh and I quote, suck, this year.
PATIENCE
Ugh.
RONSON
Yeah.
PATIENCE
Inspiring.
RONSON
Oh yeah. If only we had a killer setter on the team, some, some secretly athletic bookworm, to carry us to victory.
[PATIENCE has reached her locker and is rummaging around in it. After saying her bit RONSON gestures grandly at PATIENCE.]
PATIENCE
Ronson, I was twelve.
RONSON
And the best volleyball player I’ve ever seen.
PATIENCE (chuckling)
It’s senior year, I have five AP classes plus volunteering, I do not have time.
[While PATIENCE is talking RONSON moves back slowly. She throws the ball at her. PATIENCE turns and catches it, looking exasperated. RONSON is astounded.]
RONSON
See?
PATIENCE
Really?
RONSON
You’re freaking Wonderwoman!
[PATIENCE cocks her head and smiles.]
RONSON
It’s such a waste.
[PATIENCE throws the ball back to RONSON and laughs. She shoulders a bag. RONSON looks disappointed.]
PATIENCE
Need a lift?
RONSON
Nah.
[RONSON sniffs her shirt and makes a face.]
RONSON
I am ripe. Gotta hit the showers, later!
PATIENCE
Later.
[PATIENCE is smiling. She closes her locker as RONSON jogs down the hallway. She adjusts her bag as the lights flicker. She turns towards the hallway.]
PATIENCE
Hello?
[The lights continue to flicker. PATIENCE looks around in apprehension. She begins to walk slowly down the hallway. She looks down and sees a blood trail on the floor. They lead to a dead MISSOURI who is sitting with her eyes closed. Suddenly she opens her eyes and looks at PATIENCE.]
MISSOURI
Patience.
[PATIENCE is shocked. She opens her mouth to scream and the WRAITH grabs her from behind, his spike extended.]
[INTERIOR – PATIENCE’S ROOM, JAMES’ HOUSE – DAY]
[PATIENCE sits upright as she wakes up from the dream. She is breathing heavily. An alarm, set for 6:00 begins beeping. She turns it off and tries to shake off the dream.]
PATIENCE
Okay.
[INTERIOR – LIVING ROOM, JAMES’ HOUSE – DAY]
[JAMES is sitting at a desk in front of a computer. PATIENCE, dressed for the day and with a bag walks into the room.]
PATIENCE
You’re working from home?
JAMES
Yeah, I have a client call in a few. How’d you sleep?
PATIENCE
I had a nightmare, actually. Grandma was there.
JAMES
Oh, it’s just a dream.
[PATIENCE gives a small smile and leaves the room. JAMES is lost in thought.]
[INTERIOR – GAS-N-SIP – DAY]
[DEAN sets down a six-pack of beer, some chips and snacks on the billing counter. The news is playing on a television behind the counter. DEAN indicates the IMPALA outside.]
DEAN
And uh, twenty on the pump.
NEWSCASTER (on the television screen)
There have been two murders in the last twenty-four hours, both at the same local business. The latest victim has been identified as Missouri Moseley. She was found dead at the scene. Now, we’ll have more information as soon as we get it but investigators are on scene.
[EXTERIOR – GAS-N-SIP – DAY]
DEAN
And you know what, she knew it. She, I mean we could’ve protected her.
JODY
Do you want to head back?
DEAN
No. No, Missouri wanted us to save her family. That’s exactly what we’re going to do.
[The IMPALA drives away from the GAS-N-SIP.]
[INTERIOR – JAMES’ HOUSE – DAY]
[DEAN and JODY are outside JAMES’ door. DEAN knocks and JAMES opens the door.]
DEAN
James Turner. We need to talk.
JAMES
Look, whatever you’re selling I’m not interested.
[JAMES tries to close the door but DEAN holds it open.]
JODY
It’s about… It’s about your mom. Missouri sent us, she’s…
DEAN
Dead.
JAMES
Dead.
DEAN
A wraith got her.
JAMES
Look whatever game you’re playing here, I talked to my mother yesterday.
DEAN
She died last night. Nine pm, according to the coroner’s office.
JAMES
I… No, I… I hung up on her.
JODY
James, I need you to listen to me. Missouri sent us because the thing that killed her, it’s still out there. It’s coming for you and your daughter.
[INTERIOR – SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY]
[RONSON and PATIENCE are walking down the hallway; the scene is reminiscent of PATIENCE’S dream.]
RONSON
Not even Amed? I’ve seen him drooling all over you in chem lab.
PATIENCE
He’s cute…
RONSON (in disbelief)
No, no, no, he’s hot. Crazy hot.
[They reach PATIENCE’S locker and stop. She opens it.]
PATIENCE
Okay, he’s hot but when am I finding the time to deal with some high school boy’s crush? Besides, that boy is failing chemistry.
RONSON
Like that matters.
PATIENCE
Matters to me.
[RONSON sighs and then sniffs her shirt. She makes a face and walks away from PATIENCE down the hallway.]
PATIENCE
Where’re you going?
RONSON
Ugh, I am ripe. I gotta hit the showers, later!
PATIENCE
Later.
[PATIENCE looks perplexed. She continues to look inside the locker when she hears a whisper calling her name. She looks up.]
PATIENCE
Hello?
[She hears RONSON’S dialogue about hitting the showers and remembers her dream. The screen flashes between her walking down the hallway in real time and in the dream. The place where she saw MISSOURI is empty but she hears her voice calling her name again. She looks back and breathes out, deciding it is nothing. She returns to her locker and continues to put her books back. We see her in front of the open locker door.]
PATIENCE
Okay.
[She takes a single book out and shuts the locker door. Behind it the WRAITH is waiting with his spike extended.]
ACT THREE
[INTERIOR – SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY]
[The WRAITH slams PATIENCE against the row of lockers and covers her mouth with his hand, shushing her.]
WRAITH
Good girl.
[PATIENCE kicks him in the groin and punches his face. She dodges his counterattacks and rips the spike from his wrist. Black blood gushes out and the WRAITH screams in pain. He runs after PATIENCE and catches her knocking them both to the ground. He sits atop her and restrains her hands. He holds up the hand with the remains of the spike.]
WRAITH
This hurts like hell. But don’t worry, it grows back.
[A gun, DEAN’S, is seen shooting a bullet. The WRAITH takes the bullet in his back and yells. He gets up and runs down the hall towards the exit. DEAN runs after the WRAITH. JODY hurries to where PATIENCE is lying on the floor and helps her up.]
JODY
You okay?
[The WRAITH grabs a mop from a bin at the end of the hallway and uses it to barricade the exit door after he leaves. DEAN looks at him through the glass but the WRAITH runs away before he can shoot. DEAN runs back up the hallway.]
DEAN
I got it, stay with her.
[DEAN runs down a stairwell and through a locker room. He exits the school and looks around the parking lot he is on. The noise of wheels is heard and DEAN is held in the lights of a van that is heading straight for him. He dives out of the way and watches as the van leaves.]
[INTERIOR – SCHOOL HALLWAY – NIGHT]
[DEAN returns to where JODY and PATIENCE are waiting. PATIENCE looks rattled.]
DEAN
I lost him. Did you get a good look at him?
PATIENCE
Yeah, uh he um, he tried to stab me with that.
[The WRAITH’S spike is lying on the floor, trailing black fluid. JODY picks it up and looks at PATIENCE in surprise and admiration.]
JODY
Wait, you…? Wow.
DEAN
Alright, well that thing might come back, so…
PATIENCE
Why?
JODY
Well, all we know is that he stalks psychics.
PATIENCE
Psychics? Then what does he want with me?
DEAN
What do you think?
PATIENCE
I… No, I’m not… I get déjà vu sometimes but that’s normal. I’m normal.
JODY
Your grandmother was psychic and she sent us to protect you.
PATIENCE
My grandma said she was psychic but she’s a fraud. She doesn’t care about me, she ditched me. Me and Dad, right after Mom died.
[DEAN and JODY look surprised.]
DEAN
Okay, this woman you’re describing, that walked out on her family? That’s not who Missouri was at all.
PATIENCE
Why do you keeping saying ‘was’?
[INTERIOR – LIBRARY, BUNKER – NIGHT]
[SAM is sitting at a table watching a live camera feed of JACK sitting at the table in the other room, on a laptop. He has a book, THE DRAMA OF THE GIFTED CHILD, next to the laptop. He opens the book and reads it in front of the laptop screen. When he moves the book, JACK has disappeared from the table where he was sitting. SAM throws the book down and hurries to the room.]
SAM
Jack? Jack! Jack!
[JACK is not sitting at the table anymore; he is sitting on the floor in the corner of the room, hidden in the shadows. SAM notices him.]
SAM
Jack, what’re you doing?
JACK (holding the pencil)
I moved the pencil.
SAM
Okay, look. I know this isn’t exactly fun-
JACK
No, it’s the opposite of fun.
SAM
Okay, but why is it so hard? I’ve seen you throw people across the room. I’ve been thrown across the room by you. I’ve seen you open a gate to hell and now nothing? It doesn’t make any sense.
JACK
It makes sense, if I’m evil.
SAM
What?
JACK
Just, go. Please.
SAM
No, Jack. Why do you think you’re evil? Because when I look at you, that’s not what I see.
JACK
Yeah well, Dean sees it. That’s why he says… he said he’d kill me.
SAM
He what?
JACK
And maybe he should. Mom said I could be good, that I had the choice to be good, that it was up to me. But she’s dead, because of me. I’ve only been on earth for a few days and I’ve already hurt people. I’ve already done bad things, and no matter how hard I try I can’t… I can’t do the one good, stupid thing you want me to. So I must be evil, like Lucifer.
SAM
Jack, listen, Asmodeus tricking you, Dean, none of that is your fault. I think that uh, after everything that’s happened you’re probably scared to use your power, and me pressuring you certainly isn’t helping.
JACK
Really?
SAM
Really. What do you say we call it? Until I figure out a better way. How does that sound?
JACK
It sounds… good.
SAM
Good. Come on.
[SAM offers his hand to JACK, who takes it and stands up.]
JACK
Sam, why are you being so nice to me?
SAM
Because I know what it feels like, to feel like you don’t belong. To feel like there’s this darkness inside of you, to be scared of who you are, what you can do. Dean, Cas, my family helped me through that. So now I want to help you, because you’re not evil, Jack.
[INTERIOR – JAMES’ HOUSE – NIGHT]
[JODY and DEAN are watching PATIENCE and JAMES talk.]
PATIENCE
You told me she left us, but they say… Dad? Is it true?
JAMES
Yes.
PATIENCE
You said she was fake!
JAMES
She was! At least, I felt like she was, after. I always believed in her powers, I had total faith in them but… they were wrong.
PATIENCE
What do you mean?
JAMES
When your mother got sick, Grandma told me, she said, ‘Tess will be alright.’ She promised me, but then Tess… She apologized after, she said nothing’s ever set in stone but I, I couldn’t forgive her.
DEAN
So you cut your mother out of her life?
PATIENCE
This whole time I could have had a relationship with her.
JAMES
Growing up with her, she was always on the road, hunting! I spent my entire childhood terrified of monsters, of losing her. I didn’t want that life for you, I… I didn’t want her encouraging-
PATIENCE
Encouraging what!
JAMES
Grandma believed… She felt you had the gift.
PATIENCE
Oh my god.
JAMES
But you didn’t. Baby, you don’t. I mean, you’re eighteen! If you had powers, we’d know it by now.
PATIENCE
My dream, last night? I saw what happened before it happened. I-
JODY
Your daughter is psychic, that’s why the wraith is coming after her.
JAMES
So we run. We can work all this out later but right now get your things, we need to go.
[PATIENCE looks at DEAN and JODY, unsure.]
JAMES
Patience, I said now!
[PATIENCE turns and leaves to her room. She stands a few seconds and then walks to her trophy shelf. There is a framed photo of JAMES and her on the shelf. She opens a box on the dresser and takes out a talisman which she holds in her palm. She closes her hand over it.]
[EXTERIOR – PAST – GRAVEYARD – DAY]
[A young PATIENCE sees her grandmother MISSOURI and father JAMES arguing in front of her.]
MISSOURI
James, you can’t.
JAMES
I can. I have to. Patience, she’s… she’s all I’ve got.
MISSOURI
You have me!
JAMES
I don’t want you influencing her, poisoning her. You need to say goodbye.
MISSOURI
James…
[MISSOURI has tears in her eyes. She walks up to PATIENCE, smiling.]
MISSOURI
Hey baby, I got something for you.
[MISSOURI places the same talisman in PATIENCE’S hands.]
MISSOURI
I promise, no matter what happens, no matter where I go, I will always look out for you. You hear?
[PATIENCE nods. MISSOURI gives her a hug.]
[INTERIOR – PRESENT – PATIENCE’S ROOM – NIGHT]
[PATIENCE smiles sadly as she looks at the talisman. She pulls a suitcase out from under the bed and unzips it on the bed. She opens her closet. The WRAITH is in her closet, his spike extended, smiling at her.]
[INTERIOR – JAMES’ LIVING ROOM – NIGHT]
[DEAN, JODY, and JAMES hear PATIENCE scream and run up the stairs to her room. There is no sign of either her or the WRAITH. The window is open.]
ACT FOUR
[INTERIOR – LIVING ROOM, JAMES’ HOUSE – NIGHT]
[DEAN is looking at footage from a traffic camera on a laptop. JAMES sits opposite him, looking despondent. JODY is on the phone.]
JODY
Okay, thanks. You get anything from the traffic cam?
DEAN
Yeah it caught the van in a light a few blocks from here but it’s too blurred to get a plate. What’d the sheriff say?
JODY
Well, they said they’d keep an eye out but…
[JODY shrugs. JAMES looks at her reproachfully. He gets up suddenly and retrieves a wooden chest which he places on the table. He unlocks it with a key and opens it to reveal various paraphernalia, including a picture of MISSOURI and roughhewn pouch with gems in it. He closes the box and sets a map on the table.]
JODY
James?
JAMES
When I was a boy and my mother was out on a hunt, I got so scared. She gave me these, the thematic gems. Divination tools. She taught me how to use them so we could always find each other wherever we were.
DEAN
You’re, doing magic?
JAMES
Desperate times.
[INTERIOR – WRAITH’S HIDEOUT – NIGHT]
[PATIENCE is tied to a chair in the middle of the room, in what appears to be an abandoned house of some sort, unconscious. She wakes slowly and tries to break her bonds, looking around in fear.]
WRAITH
You’re awake.
[The WRAITH comes into sight, walking towards her.]
WRAITH
You’re probably wondering why I didn’t drain you on the spot. See, first psychic I ever had, it was total accident. Just this guy in a mental ward, thought he was normal crazy but turns out he wasn’t crazy at all. And once I got a taste... See with a psychic, it’s different, it’s a rush. You know, I become clearer. Everything becomes clearer, strong and focused.
[The WRAITH’S spike has extended while he was talking. He walks towards PATIENCE and crouches next to her so his spike is against her neck.]
WRAITH
But I gotta tell you, your grandmother was by far the best I ever had. That got me to thinking; you are made of the same stuff. Huh.
[The WRAITH has moved to the other side of the chair. He takes a deep breath, taking in her scent.]
WRAITH
You’re young and healthy, with you I’ll really stretch this out. I’m going to feed on you and feed on you. I’m going to milk that big, beautiful brain of yours, forever.
PATIENCE
First, gross. Second, I’m not psychic. You’re wasting your time.
[The WRAITH has moved away from the chair, his back to PATIENCE.]
WRAITH
Well, your granny thought you were, saw it when I ate her up. But hey, guess I better make sure for myself, right? Time for a little taste test.
[He turns to her, his spike extended. The camera zooms into PATIENCE’S face. A noise is heard before the WRAITH can attack and DEAN, JODY, and JAMES enter the room. The WRAITH darts away before they can see him. DEAN indicates to JODY to move to other side of the house while he takes point. JAMES runs to PATIENCE and starts to untie her hands.]
JAMES
Patience, baby.
PATIENCE
Dad.
JAMES
I’m going to get you out of here, okay?
[DEAN and JODY are sweeping the house, on the lookout the WRAITH. Something breaks and JAMES stands up looking for the source. He is impaled by the WRAITH’S spike in his throat. He falls to the ground, clutching his throat. The WRAITH moves away.]
PATIENCE
Dad! No, Dad!
[JODY walks in hearing PATIENCE’S cry. The WRAITH pushes her from behind and forces her arm down, stabbing her with the knife she’s holding. He pulls out the knife and JODY falls lifeless to the ground.]
DEAN
Jody!
[DEAN is still looking for the WRAITH, he has his gun extended and walks along the length of a room, missing the hidden WRAITH in one of the gaps between hanging tarps. The WRAITH jumps out and holds DEAN against the wall with the bloody knife against his neck. He stabs DEAN repeatedly in the stomach and throws his body to the ground. We see the three bodies again and then PATIENCE’S face at the moment before they enter the room for the first time. The previous events have been a vision.]
WRAITH
Time for a little taste test.
[The scene repeats itself as DEAN, JODY and JAMES enter the room, with DEAN and JODY splitting up and JAMES going to PATIENCE.]
JAMES
Patience, baby.
PATIENCE
Dad?
JAMES
I’m going to get you out of here alright?
[There is the same sound of something breaking and JAMES stands up. PATIENCE recalls her vision.]
PATIENCE
Move!
[JAMES dodges the WRAITH’S attack and gets slashed on his shoulder. He falls to the floor. JODY walks in looking at him on the floor. PATIENCE sees the vision of JODY getting stabbed and calls out to her.]
PATIENCE
Jody, behind you!
[JODY slashes at the WRAITH who is behind her who pushes her and against a wall and tries to disarm her. She punches him in the face and he retaliates knocking her out. He takes the knife.]
DEAN
Jody!
[DEAN is looking for the WRAITH, his gun out just as in the vision.]
PATIENCE
Dean!
[The WRAITH pins DEAN against the wall and knocks the gun out of his hand. He pushes him and tries to stab him but DEAN kicks himself free. He grabs a rope that is hanging from a column and they spar. The WRAITH throws him to a table with a scythe on it which DEAN grabs. The WRAITH comes at him again, swinging with the knife, and traps DEAN wrestling him to the wall. DEAN untangles himself and turns the WRAITH against the wall, trapping him with the scythe and stabbing him with the knife the WRAITH is still holding. He pushes it in deeper until he falls dead. Back in the main room, JAMES and JODY are stirring. PATIENCE is still bound to the chair. JODY stands up as DEAN walks in.]
DEAN
You okay?
JODY
Uh.
DEAN
How did you…?
PATIENCE
Guess I’m psychic.
DEAN
Huh.

ACT FIVE
[EXTERIOR – JAMES’ HOUSE – DAY]
[JODY and DEAN are leaning against the IMPALA.]
JODY
The way you handled that wraith you still got it.
DEAN
Hmm, guess so.
[PATIENCE walks towards them coming from the house.]
JODY
Hey!
DEAN
You know, I said it before, but good work in there.
PATIENCE
Thanks, for everything.
DEAN
Have you given any thought to what’s next?
PATIENCE
I don’t know. School is in an hour, so I guess calculus?
JODY
And your gift?
PATIENCE
I talked to my dad. He thinks I should put it away. Dad says we should just get back to normal. Maybe he’s right.
DEAN
He is. This life, hunting, monsters, there’s no joy in it. There’s nothing but pain, horror and death. So if you get a chance at normal, you take it.
[DEAN turns to the IMPALA and PATIENCE moves back to her house. JODY goes after her.]
JODY
Patience, wait. I may be out of line here but you don’t have to listen to him. To either of them if it’s not what you really want. I had a daughter, I guess, Claire, and I asked her to stay in line, to fight who she really was because I thought it would keep her safe. It didn’t work, it never does. Your gift… or maybe you’re right, maybe it’ll go away. But if it doesn’t? You try to force it down to make someone else happy, you will only make yourself miserable. It’s your choice. But if you ever need someone to talk to or someplace to go, my door is always open.
[JODY hands her a card. She and DEAN enter the IMPALA while PATIENCE looks after them.]
[INTERIOR – LIBRARY, BUNKER – NIGHT]
[SAM is waiting at the table in front of a laptop. The door to the bunker opens and DEAN enters, coming down the stairs.]
SAM
How was it? Uh, Jody told me about Missouri.
DEAN
Yeah, just another day at the office. How’s the kid? He go dark side yet?
SAM
Nope. He is uh, he’s pretty messed up though.
[SAM has turned in his chair so he is facing DEAN.]
DEAN
You’re telling me.
SAM
No, Dean. He’s messed up because of you. Dean, you said you’d kill him.
DEAN
It wasn’t exactly like that.
SAM
Then how exactly was it?
DEAN
I told him the truth. See, you think you can use this freak but I know how this ends and it ends bad.
[The camera pans and we see JACK outside the room, listening to the boys’ conversation.]
SAM
I didn’t.
DEAN
What?
SAM
I didn’t ‘end bad’. When I was the freak, when I was drinking demon blood.
[SAM is standing up and moving towards DEAN.]
DEAN
Come on man, that’s totally different.
SAM
Was it? Because you could’ve put a bullet in me. Dad told you to put a bullet in me, but you didn’t! You saved me! So help me save him!
DEAN
You deserved to be saved, he doesn’t!
SAM
Yes he does, Dean, of course he does!
[JACK is still eavesdropping outside the room.]
DEAN
Look, I know you think that you can use him as some sort of an interdimensional can-opener and that’s fine, but don’t act like you care about him! Because you only care about what he can do for you! So if you want to pretend, that’s fine! But me? I can hardly look at the kid! Because when I do all I see is everybody we’ve lost!
SAM
Mom chose to take that shot at Lucifer. That is not on Jack!
DEAN
And what about Cas?
SAM
What about Cas?
DEAN
He manipulated him, he made him promises, said, ‘paradise on earth’ and Cas bought it and you know what that got him? It got him dead! Now you might be able to forget about that, but I can’t!
[JACK looks distressed outside the room.]
JACK
Castiel.
[JACK’S eyes glow gold.]
[INTERIOR – BLACK SPACE – NIGHT]
[CASTIEL is lying on the floor, his eyes closed.]
JACK (echoing)
Castiel.
[CASTIEL jerks awake and sits up slowly. He looks around, bewildered.]
