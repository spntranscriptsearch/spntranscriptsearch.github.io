TEASER
INT. COUNTRY FARM – NIGHT
A MAN, BILL GIBSON, is having dinner while watching TV.

TV
Following the Civil War, the eyes of the nation turned to the West, where outposts like Fort Bellows served as—

The lights go out.

BILL
Aw, come on. Crap.

BILL tries to open the door, but it's locked.

BILL
What the hell?! Man.

A closet door opens and a ghostly GIRL comes out.

BILL
You? I-It's impossible. Just stay away from me! Just stay away from me!

The GIRL attacks and kills BILL.

ACT ONE
INT. CAR – NIGHT

SAM wakes from sleeping in the backseat of the car. DEAN is studying some papers.

SAM
What are you doing?

DEAN
What's it look like I'm doing?

SAM
Like you're looking for a job.

DEAN
Yahtzee.

SAM sits up.

SAM
We just finished a job like two hours ago.

DEAN
Adrenaline's still pumping, I guess. So, what do you think... Cedar Rapids, Tulsa, or Chi-Town?

SAM
I am all for working. I really am. But you got us chasing cases nonstop for like a month now. We need sleep.

DEAN
Yeah, we can sleep when we're dead.

SAM
You're exhausted, Dean.

DEAN
I'm good.

SAM
No, you're not. You're running on fumes, and you can't run forever.

DEAN
And what am I running from?

SAM
From what you told me. Or are we pretending that never happened?

DEAN
Stratton, Nebraska. Farm town. A man gets hacked to death in a locked room inside a locked house. No signs of forced entry.

SAM
Sounds like a ghost.

DEAN
Yes, it does.

SAM sighs and flops back down.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD – DAY

As the Impala drives into the house road we see the SOLD sign hidden in the grass.

INT. FARM – DAY

INT. HOUSE – DAY

DEAN
Boy, three bedrooms, two baths, and one homicide. This place is gonna sell like hotcakes.

They enter the kitchen, opening cabinets. DEAN spots something on an empty piece of wall.

DEAN
Hey, check this out.

DEAN knocks on the wall. It's hollow.

DEAN
Huh.

SAM
It's probably a dumbwaiter. All these old houses had them.

DEAN
Know-it-all.

SAM
What?

DEAN
What?

SAM
You said...

DEAN
What?

SAM
Never mind.

They enter a bedroom.

DEAN
Well, no bloodstains, fresh coat of paint, it's a bunch of bubkes.

SAM
Needle's all over the place.

DEAN
Yeah—power lines.

SAM
Great.

They look in the closet; a doll head is on the floor.

SAM
Uh...

DEAN
Well, that's super-disturbing.

SAM
Think it got left behind?

DEAN
By who? Unless Bill Gibson likes to play with doll heads.

A car and moving truck approach.

SAM
Uh-oh.

DEAN
I thought you said this place was still for sale.

SAM
Apparently, it's not.

EXT. FARM – DAY

A dog and a BOY, DANNY, exit the car.

DANNY
Come on, Buster! Good dog!

They run off. A MAN, BRIAN, a WOMAN, SUSAN, and a GIRL, KATE, have also gotten out.

SUSAN
What do you think? It's nice, right?

KATE
Did anyone bother to check if we get a signal out here?

BRIAN
Actually, I did, Kate. But we decided to move anyway, just to ruin your life. Come on. Let's unpack.

ANOTHER MAN, TED, has gotten out of the truck.

KATE
Uncle Ted, please back me up here.

TED
Kid's right, Bri. You're ruining her life.

KATE
See?

BRIAN
Thanks for the help, Uncle Ted.

TED
Calling it like I see it, buddy.

SUSAN
Hey.

BRIAN
What?

SUSAN
Be nice.

BRIAN
I am nice. What do you think? We do okay?

SUSAN
I don't know.

KATE
Who are they?

DEAN and SAM are coming down the stairs from the front door.

BRIAN
Can I help you?

SAM
Hi. Are you the new owner?

BRIAN
Yeah. You guys are...?

DEAN
This is Mr. Stanwyk. I'm Mr. Babar. County code enforcement.

BRIAN
We had the building inspected last week. Is there a problem?

SAM
Asbestos in the walls, a gas leak—yeah, I'd say we got a problem.

SUSAN
Asbestos? Meaning what?

SAM
Meaning until this house is up to code, it's uninhabitable.

BRIAN
Whoa whoa whoa. You're saying we can't stay here?

DEAN
It's a health hazard. You don't want to.

TED
Hold up. We just drove four hundred miles.

DEAN
There's a motel just down the road. Till this gets cleaned up, I suggest you stay there.

BRIAN
All right, and what if we don't?

DEAN
Well, you get a fine or you go to jail. Pick your poison.

BRIAN
One night. One night, and I'll take care of everything, ASAP, I promise.

DEAN
Yeah, you do that.

KATE
Another motel? Awesome, Dad. I hope this one has hooker sheets, like the last one.

SUSAN
Danny!

BRIAN
Come on, Danny!

EXT. CURRY'S HOME – DAY

SAM
What did the room look like when you found it, Mrs. Curry?

MRS CURRY
I already told the local boys, there was blood everywhere.

DEAN
And Mr. Gibson—where was he?

MRS CURRY
Everywhere.

SAM
How long have you been cleaning Mr. Gibson's house?

MRS CURRY
About five years.

DEAN
So you knew him pretty well.

MRS CURRY
Well, not really well. He was real private. Not the easiest man. Not that I blame him.

SAM
What do you mean?

MRS CURRY
His wife dies in childbirth. Daughter hangs herself in the attic twenty years later. I'd be bitter, too. I think I got some pictures.

She goes off to get them and comes back.

MRS CURRY
Here.

DEAN
Thanks. Can we keep these?

MRS CURRY
Suit yourself.

SAM
Now, why'd the daughter kill herself?

MRS CURRY
I don't know. That was before my time.

DEAN
Did you ever notice anything odd in the house when you were cleaning it?

MRS CURRY
Like what?

DEAN
Like, you know, like lights going on and off, things not being where you left them.

MRS CURRY
No. Well, maybe there was one thing.

SAM
What's that?

MRS CURRY
Well, sometimes, I thought I heard like a...rustling in the walls.

DEAN
Like a rat?

MRS CURRY
Yeah.

DEAN
Must have been some big sons of guns out there, huh?

MRS CURRY
Wouldn't know. Never saw any.

SAM
Do you happen to know where Mrs. Gibson and her daughter were buried?

MRS CURRY
They were both cremated.

SAM and DEAN head back to the car.

SAM
All right. So it probably wasn't the mom or the daughter. Whose ghost was it?

DEAN
I don't know. But I say we give that place a real once-over and see.

EXT. FARM – DAY

TED
Code enforcement, my ass. There's no asbestos.

BRIAN
You sure?

TED
Hell yes. I've built enough homes to know that. No gas leak, either.

BRIAN
Who were those guys?

TED
Not from the county—I can tell you that.

They begin to unpack the vehicles. KATE sees someone at a window.

SUSAN
Hey!

KATE startles. The window is empty.

SUSAN
You okay?

KATE
Yeah. I just thought I saw something, that's all.

SUSAN
It—it's gonna be great here, Kate. It really is.

KATE
Yeah, Mom. I'm sure. Everything's gonna change.

INT. DANNY'S ROOM – NIGHT

SUSAN
Danny! Are you unpacking?

DANNY is playing a handheld video game.

DANNY
Uh, yeah. I'm almost finished.

DANNY hears something and puts down the game to investigate.

DANNY
Hello? It's okay. I'm Danny. Hi!

INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT

SUSAN
"Zucchini will grow, but the soil is too acidic for beets." Do you understand any of this?

BRIAN
Can you smell that?

BRIAN opens a cabinet door and flinches.

BRIAN
That. It smells like a raccoon died up there or something.

SUSAN
That's pleasant. Thank you. Can I continue having a conversation with myself?

BRIAN
Well, I'm listening. A...vegetable... garden.

SUSAN
What are we doing, Bri?

BRIAN
What do you mean?

SUSAN
Us. On a farm. Talking about zucchini.

BRIAN
It's gonna be different. I promise you. We're gonna be happy.

SUSAN
And if we're not?

BRIAN
We will be. We have to be.

SUSAN
I can't put the kids through another year like the last.

EXT. FARM – NIGHT

The car pulls up. SAM and DEAN see the lights on inside the house.

DEAN
Crap. So, what now?

SAM
We could tell them the truth.

DEAN
Really?

SAM
No, not really.

INT. DINING ROOM – NIGHT

TED
Hey, guys! You're gonna want to come see this!

BRIAN and SUSAN come to look: the word "GO" is drawn on the wall in red.

SUSAN
What the...

BRIAN scratches at the word.

BRIAN
Crayon. Danny!

DANNY
Yeah?

BRIAN
Get your butt down here!

TED
Tell you what—if my kid did this—

SUSAN
He's not your kid, Ted. Just butt out.

TED leaves.

SUSAN
Hey. Go easy on him. The teacher said he might act out.

BRIAN
Hey, buddy. Something you want to tell me and your mom?

DANNY
I didn't do that.

BRIAN
Okay. Look, just tell me the truth, and all you got to do is clean it up, okay? No punishment.

DANNY
But I didn't. The girl in the walls did it.

SUSAN
The girl in the walls?

DANNY
She wants you to go and me to stay.

BRIAN
All right, one last time—the truth, buddy.

DANNY
That is the truth. I can stay, but she hate grownups. And if you don't leave, she's gonna get really, really mad!

BRIAN
All right, go to your room.

DANNY
Mom! If Andy were here, he'd believe me!

BRIAN
Upstairs! Now!

INT. KATE'S ROOM – NIGHT

KATE is lying in bed, one hand over the side out of sight.

KATE
It's okay, Buster. It's okay. I hate it here, too.

Sounds of licking.

KATE
Ugh. Ew, Buster! Gross! What's the matter with you?

The door opens; it's BUSTER.

KATE
Oh, my god. Oh, god.

KATE turns to look. The closet door slams. KATE screams.

ACT TWO
INT. DINING ROOM – NIGHT

KATE
Ew! Ew!

SUSAN
It's okay.

DANNY
What's going on?

BRIAN
Katie, baby, baby. Calm down and tell us what happened.

KATE
I just got molested by Casper the pervy ghost! That's what happened!

BRIAN
Ghost?

KATE
Yes, dad! A ghost!

DANNY
It's the girl in the walls!

KATE
Who?!

BRIAN
Both of you, knock it off.

Somebody knocks on the front door. TED opens the door and DEAN and SAM come into.

DEAN
We heard screams. What's going on?

BRIAN
Oh, you two! Did you touch my daughter?!

DEAN
What? No.

BRIAN
Who are you guys?

SAM
Relax, please. You have a ghost.

BRIAN
A ghost.

KATE
I told you!

DANNY
It's the girl!

BRIAN
Both of you, relax. What are you guys playing?

DEAN
Your family's in danger. You need to get out of the house now.

The lights go out in the house.

TED
What the hell?

DEAN
Nobody move!

DANNY
Buster!

BUSTER is howling. BRIAN gets out of the house followed by TED, SAM, and DEAN.

EXT. FARM – NIGHT

BRIAN
Buster! Buster? Buster! Buster!

TED
What the hell?

The words "TOO LATE" are painted in red. The others come out onto the porch.

DANNY
Buster!

BRIAN
Go back inside. Go!

DEAN
We are not the bad guys, but you're in danger.

SAM
First thing's first. You got to get your family out of here.

DEAN
Head to the motel I was talking about. You'll be safe there.

BRIAN
What are you two gonna do?

DEAN
Oh, no! Oh, come on! Oh, come on!

The tires on the vehicles are all slashed.

SAM
Dude, the guns are gone. So is the... Basically, everything is gone.

TED
Truck's no good.

BRIAN
Both tires slashed.

DEAN
What kind of ghost messes with a man's wheels?!

KATE
What's going on? What's going on?

KATE sees the GIRL and screams.

KATE
She's there! She's there!

SUSAN
Where?!

KATE
She was right there in the woods!

DEAN
What's a ghost doing outside?

SAM
You want to stay and find out?

DEAN
Everybody inside.

TED
Are you crazy? We need to get the hell out of here!

DEAN
In what?! This ghost is hunting us! Everybody back inside now! Move!

INT. DINING ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN
Whatever's outside, it can't get in this circle. As long as the salt line is unbroken, this is the safest place to be.

BRIAN
Safe from ghosts?

DEAN
Yes, as a matter of fact.

BRIAN
Okay. I'm not listening to this anymore. Come on. I got to get my family out of here. Let's go.

DEAN
Nobody's going anywhere until we kill this thing.

SAM
Sir, please. This is what we do. Just...trust us.

DANNY
You hunt ghosts?

DEAN
That's right.

DANNY
Like Scooby-Doo?

DEAN
Better.

SAM
You saw her outside, right? Okay. Does she look like either one of the girls?

KATE
Her. She was paler and a lot dirtier, but that was her.

DANNY
That's the girl in the walls.

SAM
So it's the daughter?

SUSAN
That girl in the picture—She-She's dead?

SAM
She killed herself inside this house.

DEAN
So, what. The maid got her story wrong? Rebecca wasn't cremated?

SAM
Unless her spirit's just attached to something inside the house.

DEAN
She hung herself in the attic, right?

SAM
You want to babysit? I'll check it out.

TED
Look—I don't care who hung themselves where. Maybe something is going on here, but—

DEAN
It's a spirit, man.

TED
No, it's just some backwoods hillbilly bitch, and I'm not about to sit around here waiting for her to go all Deliverance on my ass.

DEAN
Well, nobody's leaving the house.

TED
Stop me.

DEAN
Listen, man. I've got a gun. You don't get your ass back in that circle, you're gonna have yourself a third hole.

SAM
Dude, you don't have a gun.

DEAN
And? I'm not letting that bastard or anyone else die tonight.

SAM
You cool?

DEAN
Go.

SAM leaves.

TED
Hey. Fonzie. Question for you. This indestructible force field made out of salt... Have to be kosher stuff, or what?

SUSAN
Knock it off, Ted.

A sound.

SUSAN
Sh..

KATE
What was that?

They look around. The GIRL opens a door and comes in.

KATE
Mom.

DEAN
All right, everybody stay calm. She's a ghost. She can't come in the circle.

The GIRL continues to approach. She stops at the edge of the salt, reveals she's holding a knife, and steps over the line.

KATE
I thought you said ghosts couldn't cross the circle.

DEAN
They can't. She's not a ghost.

TED
Shoot her! Shoot her!

DEAN
Yeah, about that... Go, go, go! Move!

DEAN fights her while she screams and the others run.

SAM
Hey!

SAM shines a light in her face. It hurts her eyes; she runs.

EXT. FARM – NIGHT

BRIAN
Hey. You okay?

DEAN
Where is everybody?

BRIAN
Hiding.

DEAN
All right, go get them. Go. Go get them.

DEAN
So, it's not a ghost.

SAM
So, it's just a girl?

DEAN
It's not just a girl. It's psycho Nell. I'm telling you, man—humans.

SAM
So who is she, then?

DEAN
I don't know. Maybe it's the daughter, Rebecca. Maybe she didn't hang herself.

SAM
Dude, no. She'd have to be like fifty years old by now.

DEAN
Well, I don't know. What'd you find in the attic?

SAM
Some old junk. I found Rebecca's diary. That's about it.

DEAN
I wish you'd found a howitzer. Listen, we got to get this family safe. I mean, it's just a human, so they can make a run for it. We just got to hold her off.

SUSAN
We're okay.

BRIAN
Danny! Ted! We got to go!

TED
I'm good!

SUSAN
Danny! Come on!

BRIAN
Danny, buddy, we got to go!

TED
Told you it was some crazy bitch.

DEAN
Yes, you did.

SAM
Head to town. We'll take it from here, okay?

SUSAN
Danny, come on, baby! We're leaving!

BRIAN
Danny, we got to go!

SUSAN
Brian, where—Where is he?

BRIAN
Danny!

ACT THREE
EXT. FARM – NIGHT

SUSAN
Danny!

BRIAN
Suse, Suse, Suse. We will find Danny, I promise you.

SUSAN
No.

BRIAN
No. Take Kate and go now. Now, while you still have a chance.

SUSAN
Not without Danny.

BRIAN
We will find him.

KATE
I am not going out there with Mom alone.

DEAN
She's right. Until we find your son, the safest place for you right now is in the shed.

KATE
I am not going in there either.

DEAN
Yes, you are. It is the best defense. The windows are boarded up. It's got one door. It's our best shot right now. Trust me.

BRIAN
Suse. Kate. Go. Go.

SAM
All right, you and me will take the outside. You two take the house. Let's go.

INT. HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN and TED poke around the room. TED finds a butcher knife. DEAN investigates the walls.

TED
What are you doing?

DEAN
She's human. She had to come from somewhere.

DEAN finds a board that isn't securely attached to the rest. They pull it open. TED flinches.

TED
You smell that?

DEAN
Every day.

DEAN takes the knife and shines a flashlight around inside the walls, then goes in.

DEAN
Come on.

TED comes up behind DEAN. They go further in. DEAN finds a hole in the floor and looks through.

TED
You're not going down there.

DEAN
Well, do you want to?

TED says nothing. DEAN starts down.

DEAN
Please nobody grab my leg. Please nobody grab my leg.

DEAN shines the light around the room. A rat corpse is inches from his face; he startles. He sees BUSTER, torn to shreds.

DEAN
Dog. It's what's for dinner. Danny?

TED
Find anything?

DEAN
Yeah, her kitchen.

TED
Her what?

DEAN looks around more; there is artwork on one wall, two stick figures drawn in probably-blood.

TED turns around and comes face to face with the girl. She stabs him.

DEAN hurries back; TED's head comes through the hole.

INT. SHED – NIGHT

BRIAN
Look, why are we just standing here? Let's go in. Let's check the house.

SAM
We have to wait for those guys to get back, okay?

A knocking sound.

DEAN
Sam, it's me.

SAM
Help me out.

They move what's holding the door shut and open the shed door. DEAN comes in.

SUSAN
Did you get Danny?

DEAN
No.

SUSAN
No? Well, where's Ted?

DEAN
He's outside.

SUSAN
Well, why doesn't he come inside?

DEAN
Because I had to carry him out. I'm sorry.

SUSAN
You're...what does that mean? What does that mean, you're sorry?

BRIAN
Are you saying that he's dead?

SUSAN
No. No, he's not saying that he's dead. You're not saying that, are you?

DEAN
We were in the walls and she attacked.

SUSAN
Oh my god.

DEAN
And I couldn't get to him in time.

KATE
Uncle Ted is dead?

DEAN
I shouldn't have left him alone. I'm very sorry.

DEAN goes back outside.

SAM reads REBECCA's diary.

BRIAN
We'll find him, Suse. We will.

SUSAN
Where else is there to look? Danny's dead, isn't he?

BRIAN
No, Suse.

SUSAN
He is. Why not? She killed my brother. Now she killed my son.

BRIAN
No, Danny is alive.

SUSAN
No, no, he isn't.

BRIAN
Yes, he is. Do you remember what he said about the girl who lived in the walls? She said he could stay.

SUSAN
No. No. I just don't understand why this happens to us. I mean, we're good people. We're a good family.

BRIAN
What happened to Andy happened, okay? I cannot change that. But I will find Danny, I promise you. And when I do, we are gonna be fine. You and me, the kids, we're gonna be fine.

SUSAN
Okay.

SAM, who has been pretending to read, returns to actually reading.

EXT. FARM – NIGHT

BRIAN stares up at the house.

DEAN
Andy your son?

BRIAN
Oldest. He got himself killed in a car accident last year.

DEAN
I'm sorry.

BRIAN
It nearly tore Suse and I apart. Still could, I imagine. That's why we moved here. Fresh air, fresh start. Not even my line. Marriage counselor. 'Course, she might be right. After all, what could possibly go wrong in the country?

DEAN
I'm getting your son back. If it's the last godforsaken thing I do.

BRIAN
Why do you care so much?

SAM
Dean.

SAM appears and holds up REBECCA's diary.

SAM
We gotta talk.

INT. HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN
What is that?

SAM
Rebecca's diary. I just finished reading it.

DEAN
And?

SAM
That girl back there? Pretty sure she was Rebecca's daughter.

DEAN
Rebecca had a kid?

SAM
It's all she talks about. Being pregnant, being ashamed of being pregnant.

DEAN
Jeez, rent Juno and get over it. Wait, why kill herself after the baby?

SAM
Maybe because her dad called her a dirty little whore and said he was gonna lock the baby up.

DEAN
Why would he say that?

SAM says nothing.

DEAN
Oh, gross.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
So the daddy was the babydaddy too?

SAM
Dude was a monster, Dean.

DEAN
Wow, a story ripped from an Austrian headline. Humans, man. So she's been locked up her whole life?

SAM
You saw her eyes. Has she ever seen light? She's barely human.

DEAN
Okay, so, what, then, she's been caged up like an animal and she busts out and ganks dear old Dad? Slash Granddad?

SAM
I guess.

DEAN
Well, can't say I blame her.

SAM
I'm sure her life was hell, Dean. It doesn't mean she gets a free pass for murder.

DEAN
Like you know what hell's like.

SAM
I didn't...

DEAN
Forget it.

SAM
So where do we find her?

DEAN
Kid's gotta eat, right?

SAM
What?

DEAN
He kept her hidden, locked up, but he had to feed her, didn't he?

SAM
I guess.

DEAN
I think I know where.

INT. BASEMENT – NIGHT

DANNY is bound and gagged on the floor. He wakes up and struggles. He looks around and tries to scream. He sees the girl come through a hole in the wall. She smiles and holds up a live rat. He tries to scream some more. She looks at him, confused, and breaks the rat's neck and bites in. He keeps trying to scream.

ACT FOUR
INT. DUMBWAITER SHAFT

DEAN and SAM bust a hole in the kitchen wall, letting light into the shaft.

SAM
Could've kept her hidden here for years. Kept her fed, nobody would ever know.

BRIAN flinches away from the open shaft.

BRIAN
Danny! Danny!

DEAN shines a light down the shaft.

DEAN
Watch out, I'm going down.

BRIAN
No. That's my son.

DEAN
I know it is, but I said that I would get him. I will. Let me.

DEAN looks down and up the shaft and scoots through the hole, then starts to climb down the side.

SAM
Hey, you got curtains? We need rope.

BRIAN goes looking while SAM holds the light on DEAN.

INT. BASEMENT – NIGHT

DEAN hits the bottom of the shaft and looks around. There's a rosary on the floor with a large wooden cross.

INT. SHED – NIGHT

SUSAN
It's okay. Shh. It's okay.

One of the boarded-up windows bursts in. SUSAN and KATE scream.

INT. BASEMENT – NIGHT

DEAN finds one of his guns. He picks it up and checks it.

DEAN
Bitch is a klepto.

DEAN finds another gun and checks it too.

DEAN
Come on. Danny. Danny.

The sounds of DANNY trying to scream.

DEAN
Danny?

DEAN finds a hole in the brick wall. He shines the light through and sees DANNY, still bound and gagged. He grabs a butcher knife from nearby (possibly he was still carrying it) and cuts DANNY's bonds. DANNY scrambles through the hole.

DEAN
Your dad's upstairs. Come on. Watch your head, watch your head.

DANNY
Hurry, he's coming back.

DEAN
He?

DANNY
Her brother.

An inarticulate yell. A BOY tackles DEAN, who drops the light.

INT. SHED – NIGHT

SUSAN holds a rake. They watch the open window nervously. A knife comes through the wall right behind them. They scream.

KATE
Oh my god!

INT. BASEMENT – NIGHT

DEAN and the BOY struggle while DANNY watches.

INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT

SAM drops one end of a rope of knotted curtains down the shaft. DANNY appears at the bottom.

SAM
Danny!

INT. BASEMENT – NIGHT

DEAN and the BOY fight. DEAN loses a gun.

INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT

DANNY ties himself into the rope.

DANNY
Okay!

SAM
Pull.

BRIAN
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy. Don't look back, Danny. Just come on, come.

They hoist DANNY up the shaft.

INT. SHED – NIGHT

SUSAN and KATE look around. A box against the wall moves.

KATE
Mom.

SUSAN shoves KATE behind her and tries to hold the wall with the rake under the bottom.

KATE
Mom!

INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT

DANNY is out of the shaft.

BRIAN
Come on. You okay? It's okay.

SAM
Get him out of here. You gotta go.

BRIAN and DANNY leave. SAM shines a light down the shaft.

SAM
Dean?

INT. BASEMENT – NIGHT

The BOY stabs at DEAN, who holds him off with the light, then grabs his gun and shoots. The BOY falls. SAM comes in through the hole.

INT. SHED – NIGHT

The GIRL breaks down the wall. SUSAN and the rake are caught underneath. The GIRL holds up a knife, ready to stab, but is yanked out by the ankle.

KATE
Mom! Come on, Mom!

The GIRL screams outside. Sounds of stabbing. Pounding on the door. SUSAN and KATE scream.

BRIAN
Suse!

SUSAN and KATE rush to the door. SUSAN opens it. BRIAN is outside, holding a bloody knife.

EXT. FARM – NIGHT

KATE cries. SUSAN holds DANNY. SAM and DEAN come out the front door and see the GIRL's body.

ACT FIVE
EXT. FARM – DAY

DEAN jacks down the Impala after apparently replacing the tires. SAM pulls DEAN's duffel out of the repacked trunk and throws it in the back of the car. BRIAN and SUSAN walk over.

DEAN
Thanks for the head start.

BRIAN
Why doesn't it surprise me you guys don't like the police?

SAM
It's sort of a mutual-appreciation thing, really.

BRIAN shakes DEAN's hand.

BRIAN
Well, thank you.

SUSAN
Thank you.

DEAN
You okay?

SUSAN
No, we're the opposite of okay, but we're together.

BRIAN takes SUSAN's hand.

SUSAN
Thanks.

DEAN nods.

EXT. OVERPASS – DAY

SAM and DEAN get out of the car. SAM comes around to DEAN's side with burgers. DEAN unwraps his, looks at it, and wraps it back up.

SAM
You okay?

DEAN
You know, I felt for those sons of bitches back there. Lifelong torture turns you into something like that.

SAM
You were in hell, Dean. Look, maybe you did what you did there, but you're not them. They were barely human.

DEAN
Yeah, you're right. I wasn't like them. I was worse. They were animals, Sam, defending territory. Me? I did it for the sheer pleasure.

SAM
What?

DEAN
I enjoyed it, Sam. They took me off the rack, and I tortured souls, and I liked it. All those years, all that pain. Finally getting to deal some out yourself. I didn't care who they put in front of me. Because that pain I felt, it just slipped away. No matter how many people I save, I can't change that. I can't fill this hole. Not ever.
