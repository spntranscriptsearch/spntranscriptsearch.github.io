NOW
INT. BUILDING – DAY


SAMANDIRIEL is bound to a chair in a room with symbols painted on the windows. His face and his Weiner Hut uniform are covered with blood, and a metal pick protrudes from his forehead. We hear footsteps. SAMANDIRIEL grimaces as he expels the pick from his forehead using his angel powers.


SAMANDIRIEL
Naomi. Naomi, Crowley has me.


The door opens and a DEMON wearing a white doctor’s coat and a bow tie enters. He walks up behind SAMANDIRIEL and leans down over him.


DEMON
Ah, ah, ah. Been on angel radio, have we?


SAMANDIRIEL
No, uh...


DEMON
Don't lie to me, Alfie.


The DEMON moves to stand in front of SAMANDIRIEL.


SAMANDIRIEL
I'm not lying. Please, I wouldn't lie to you.


DEMON
Oh, Alfie, after all these weeks together. I mean, how – how I wish that were so. [He picks up the metal pick from the floor.] Now we're going to have to turn off that signal... again.


SAMANDIRIEL
No. No! No!


SAMANDIRIEL screams as the DEMON pushes the pick back into his forehead.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. MOTEL – NIGHT

Kermit, Texas


We see a close-up of the door of Room 118.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


SAM is sitting on a couch drinking a bottle of beer. He opens the door and sees DEAN. SAM partly closes the door, looking angry, then opens it fully again. DEAN walks past him into the room.


DEAN
Who did you expect?


SAM
Long drive.


DEAN
Well, I wouldn't have had to make it if you hadn't have hung up on me.


SAM
Yeah, well, I heard all I needed to hear.


DEAN
No, you heard what you wanted to hear. I told you Benny wasn't killing. Hell, I watched him end the fangbanger that was.


SAM
How about Martin? How did he end that?


DEAN
Stupid – just like I said it would. Crazy son of a bitch didn't give Benny a choice. It was self-defense.


SAM
Seriously, Dean? That's the story you're going with? That the vampire was the real victim here?


DEAN
Hey, like it or not, that's the truth, okay? There was a time when that actually meant something.


SAM
Yeah, yeah. No kidding.


DEAN
What does that mean?


SAM
You think this is just about Benny?


DEAN
What the hell are you talking about?


SAM
What the hell do you think I'm talking about?


DEAN
Amelia? Oh, come on, man. I sent you that text 'cause I needed you to – to –


SAM
You needed me to what? To tear ass to Texas? To be afraid that what happened to Jessica, what happened to... everybody that we care about might have happened to her?


DEAN
You were gonna kill Benny. What was I supposed to do?


SAM
Is that what we are? You save a vampire by making me believe that the woman I love might be dead?


DEAN
What do you want to hear, Sam? That I was wrong? Fine. I was wrong. Okay? But if you'd have just heard me out, if you'd have trusted me, all of this could have been avoided.


SAM
You didn't want me to trust you. You wanted me to trust Benny, and I can't do that.


DEAN
Right. Okay, well, then, what the hell do we do now?


SAM
That depends. It depends on you. On whether or not you're done with him.


DEAN
Well, honestly, I don't know.


DEAN and SAM look at each other for a long moment.


DEAN
Glad I made the drive.


DEAN walks past SAM and out of the room.


EXT. PLAYGROUND – DAY


Children play on the playground equipment. A WOMAN sits on a bench, holding a crying baby.


WOMAN
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.


CASTIEL appears.


CASTIEL
She's been crying for two days. [The WOMAN nods.] The doctors missed something. It's called an inguinal hernia – very hard to detect.


CASTIEL touches the baby on the forehead and the crying stops. There is the sound of wings and CASTIEL disappears as the WOMAN is leaning over the baby.


INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE IN HEAVEN


NAOMI
Castiel, we have a situation. Samandiriel has been captured.


CASTIEL
I thought Samandiriel was dead.


NAOMI
He's been missing, and now we know – Crowley has him.


CASTIEL
Where?


NAOMI
His distress call cut out before I could pinpoint his exact location, but you will find him and you will bring him home.


CASTIEL
Crowley will have warded against angels this time. I'll need help getting in.


NAOMI
Take whatever you need. But you will be certain, Castiel, it was your idea to rescue Samandiriel, not mine, not Heaven's. Do you understand?


INT. RUFUS’ CABIN – DAY


DEAN is asleep on the couch, holding a bottle of beer and snoring. CASTIEL is standing in front of the couch. DEAN opens his eyes and jumps, spilling his beer.


DEAN
Damn it, Cas! How many times I got to tell you – it's just creepy!


CASTIEL
Dean, I need your help. The angel Samandiriel...


DEAN
Sam–


CASTIEL
He's been taken.


DEAN
You mean Alfie, the wiener-on-a-stick kid?


CASTIEL
Yes. I, uh – I heard his distress call this morning.


DEAN
On what, angel radio? I thought you shut that down.


CASTIEL
Well, my penance, it's going well, and I thought it was time to turn it back on. I've, uh... been helping people, Dean.


DEAN
Well, good for you. All right. So, who snatched Heaven's most adorable angel?


CASTIEL
Crowley.


DEAN
I'm listening.


CASTIEL
Samandiriel is being held in the general vicinity of Hastings, Nebraska.


DEAN
The general vicinity? That's all you got?


CASTIEL
Yes, which is why I need your help. It seems this is gonna involve... talking to people.


DEAN
Come on, Cas, I thought you were a hunter now.


CASTIEL
Well... I thought so, too, but... It seems I – I lack a certain –


DEAN
Skill?


DEAN opens his laptop and there is a loud gonging noise from the website on the screen, “Busty Asian Beauties.” He quickly closes the laptop again.


DEAN
You saw nothing.


DEAN opens the laptop again and the gonging sound plays again. He holds up a hand to cover the screen as he minimizes the browser.


DEAN
All right. What am I looking for?


CASTIEL
Well, when you torture an angel, it screams...


DEAN types “Nebraska News, Hastings” into a search engine.


CASTIEL
...and that kind of pain, it creates a ripple effect of strange incidents. Where's Sam?


DEAN
Sam's gone. It's all right. We'll, uh, find Alfie ourselves.


The headline on the “Lincoln Globe” website on the laptop reads “Tornados, Strong Winds Cause Damage Across Nebraska.”


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


A nature program plays on a small, old television. SAM sits on the couch holding the TV remote.


NARRATOR ON TELEVISION
This charming little dung beetle makes his living upon the sands of Egypt. Here, billions of tiny particles, the remnants of ancient seas...


There is a knock on the door.


NARRATOR ON TELEVISION
...are pushed ever higher by the relentless winds of the Sahara. This is where the dung beetle makes its living. The ancient Egyptians...


SAM opens the door.


AMELIA
Look, last night at the bar, I just wanted to make sure it was you. You know... [she enters the room] ...peeping in my window.


SAM
Peeping. You make it sound so, uh...


AMELIA
Stalker-ish?


NARRATOR ON TELEVISION
Therefore, the scarab...


SAM turns off the television.


SAM
Um...


AMELIA
Anyway, I ran out because he was leaving. He travels a lot since he's been back.


SAM
Right, n-no, I – I get it. You had someplace...


AMELIA
I had to be, yeah. Are we gonna have a whole conversation with me finishing your sentences? So, why are you here?


SAM
It's not what it looks like. I – I thought you were in trouble – that you had – It doesn't matter. You're okay.


AMELIA
I was okay. You know, settled in... content. But here you are. What am I supposed to do with that?


SAM
Give me five seconds, and I'll be gone. I didn't come here to make trouble for you. I – I came because...


AMELIA
You cared? [She walks closer to SAM.] See that? I just did it again – finished your sentence.


SAM
Yeah, I care.


AMELIA
I care, too.


They kiss.


INT. BUILDING – DAY


SAMANDIRIEL is still bound to the chair. The DEMON in the white coat is adjusting a metal contraption on SAMANDIRIEL’s head.


SAMANDIRIEL
I told you it was an accident.


DEMON
Yes, of course. But now there shall be no more accidents, no more angel radio.


SAMANDIRIEL
Stop this, please. It's been...


DEMON
...weeks, yes. We're almost there, though. I'm certain of it.


SAMANDIRIEL
I'm begging you!


DEMON
When we demons possess a human, we invade all of them, their – uh – their muscles, their bones, their brains. I can't help but wonder if it isn't the same for angels.


SAMANDIRIEL
No.


The DEMON screws the metal pick into the contraption on SAMANDIRIEL’s head. SAMANDIRIEL screams. A glass beaker of what appears to be blood shatters. The DEMON smiles and continues to screw in the pick. SAMANDIRIEL screams again. He then seems to go into a trance as a tear runs from his eye.


SAMANDIRIEL
Vah-teh-kah-rah. Vah-teh-kah-rah.


EXT. STREET – DAY


A MAN wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase walks down the street.


SAMANDIRIEL (V-O)
Vah-teh-kah-rah.


The MAN pauses.


INT. BUILDING – DAY


SAMANDIRIEL
Sal-voch-tay.


EXT. STREET – DAY


The MAN looks at a bush in the front yard of a house. The scene alternates between the MAN outside and SAMANDIRIEL in the DEMON’s torture room.


SAMANDIRIEL
Vah-teh-kah-rah. Sal-voch-tay. Sal-voch-tay. Sal-voch-tay.


The MAN leans down to investigate the bush. It bursts into flames and he steps back in surprise.


SAMANDIRIEL
Sal-voch-tay!


Huge flames rise from the bush, sending the MAN flying backwards into a fence. He falls to the ground and lies unmoving in a flower bed, his face and hands burned.


ACT TWO
EXT. STREET – DAY

Geneva, Nebraska


The IMPALA, driven by DEAN and with CASTIEL in the passenger seat, takes a corner and drives along a street.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


The MAN who was burned by the flames from the bush lies in a hospital bed. His face is badly burned and partly bandaged. DEAN knocks on the frame of the open door, and he and CASTIEL enter. DEAN is wearing a “Press” ID badge.


DEAN
Mr. Hinckley? Hi. Uh, we're from the, uh, Geneva Gazette. I wanted to ask you a few questions about your ambush. [He laughs briefly.]


MR HINCKLEY
Yeah, well... I'd laugh, too, if it didn't feel like the sun just ate my face.


CASTIEL
It's a metaphor.


DEAN
Sorry. Uh, now, in the police report, it said that the, uh – the bush, it talked to you, yeah?


MR HINCKLEY
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but, yeah.


CASTIEL
And what did it say?


MR HINCKLEY
No clue. Sounded like Klingon to me.


DEAN
Gonna need exact words.


MR HINCKLEY
Are you serious?


CASTIEL
That's his serious face, yes.


DEAN
As much as you can remember, Mr. Hinckley.


MR HINCKLEY
Sounded something like... sol-voch. Yeah. Sol-voch-tay.


CUT TO:


CASTIEL and DEAN leave MR HINKLEY’s room and walk down the hallway.


DEAN
Well, what do you think? Mean anything to you?


CASTIEL
Yes. It's Enochian. It means "obey."


DEAN
Obey? Obey what?


CASTIEL
I don't know. But the amount of pain an angel must be in not just to manifest through shrubbery but to burn – Dean... we have to find him before it's too late.


DEAN
Okay. Okay, well, look, a sign like that – Alfie can't be too far, right? So we'll just start at the bush and work our way out.


CASTIEL
And look for what exactly? Crowley could have him anywhere.


DEAN
Well, if I know Crowley, the place will be swarming with demons, so we'll just drive till we see ugly.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


AMELIA is standing in the doorway to the bathroom, wearing only SAM’s shirt.


AMELIA
It's official – I hate motels. Say something.


SAM is shirtless in bed.


SAM
What would you like me to say? That was great? That was... a mistake?


AMELIA
I don't know. Both, I guess.


SAM
I understand.


AMELIA
Do you? Do you understand I have a life here? A good man that loves me... [she sits on the edge of the bed facing SAM] ...a man I don't want to hurt?


SAM
I know.


AMELIA
And do you know you're the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning and the last thing before I go to sleep? It's tough to let something like that go.


SAM
Yeah.


AMELIA
Especially if you keep showing up here.


SAM
Are you saying you want me to leave?


AMELIA
I'm telling you that if you stay, against everything I believe in, I would be with you. But if you leave... don't come back. I can't have you with one foot in my life and one foot out there doing... whatever it is you do. That life of yours I have no idea about.


SAM
You don't want to know about it. Believe me. It's a big step.


AMELIA
For me or you?


SAM
Both. I... need to think about this. You need to think about this. Words will never cover what you mean to me – what you'll always mean to me, but we should...


AMELIA
Think about this. Okay. How about two days from now, around 7:30? I'll be off work then. One of us will be here, and we'll know. Neither of us will be here... and we'll know. Or both of us will be here... and we'll know.


EXT. – DAY


Three shabbily-dressed men stand around a fire burning in a 44-gallon drum. The IMPALA pulls up on the other side of a fence.


INT. IMPALA – DAY


DEAN
Wow, will you look at that? Our ninth abandoned factory. Ain't that America? Hey, what do you say, this doesn't pan out, we head back to that beer-and-bacon happy hour about a mile back, huh?


CASTIEL
Wait a minute, Dean. Those derelicts, they're demons. I can see their true faces.


DEAN looks through binoculars at the men standing around the drum and sees another man on a balcony above them.


DEAN
Crowley's got that many hell monkeys outside, he's got to have at least double inside.


CASTIEL
And angel warding. I can feel it.


DEAN
Well, you, me, and a demon knife ain't gonna cut it.


CASTIEL
Okay. I'll get Sam.


DEAN
No. We don't need Sam.


CASTIEL
But you just said –


DEAN
Look, if Sam wanted in, he'd be here, okay? I got a better idea.


EXT. WHARF – DAY


A boat named “Fizzles’ Folly” is moored next to a dock.


INT. GARTH’S BOAT – DAY


Pages of symbols are stuck to a wall and other surfaces. KEVIN sits at a table with half of The Word of God demon tablet and a notebook.


DEAN
Slow read?


KEVIN
Slowest.


DEAN
Where's Garth?


KEVIN
Supply run? I don't know. Sort of lost track of when he comes and goes. You guys need help with something? I'm working here.


CASTIEL
You look horrible.


KEVIN
Yeah. Thanks.


DEAN
He's right. Are you okay, Kevin?


KEVIN
Fine. I'm just... in the middle of this.


DEAN
And? Any luck?


KEVIN
Interpreting half a demon tablet? No. I got nothing.


DEAN
All right, well, buck up, 'cause, uh, we need some more of that demon TNT ASAP.


KEVIN
You used it all?


DEAN
Yeah, so let's whip up another batch.


KEVIN
Sure. West Bank witch hazel, skull of Egyptian calf, the tail of some random-ass newt that may or may not be extinct –


DEAN
All right, all right, I get it – ingredients are hard to come by, huh?


KEVIN
That's just the first three ingredients.


CASTIEL
Give me the list. I'll get what we need.


DEAN
[smiles] Huh.


KEVIN starts making a list.


INT. BUILDING – DAY


SAMANDIRIEL is still bound to the chair and wearing the metal contraption on his head. CROWLEY enters and closes the door behind him.


CROWLEY
What on earth could you possibly need now, Viggo? I've given you every torture instrument known to man – short of a Neil Diamond album.


VIGGO
I've found something, sir. I need a translator.


CROWLEY
You're looking at him. Show me.


VIGGO twists the metal pick in SAMANDIRIEL’s forehead. CROWLEY puts on an apron.


SAMANDIRIEL
Zoh-bah-leh-ta.


CROWLEY
What have we here?


VIGGO
I think it's Enochian.


CROWLEY
Of course it's Enochian, you pigeon. The question is, why is he speaking Enochian? What have you drilled into here, Viggo, huh?


CROWLEY twists the metal pick.


SAMANDIRIEL
Zoh-bah-leh-ta. Sah-teh-voch-leh.


CROWLEY
Bollocks.


VIGGO
What is it, sir?


CROWLEY
Well, what our feathered friend was uttering essentially was, “You, celestial being, have been created to be an angel of the Lord.” You've got into his operating system – his factory settings.


VIGGO
From who? God?


CROWLEY
Who the hell cares where it comes from? Let's find out what makes this flying monkey tick.


CROWLEY twists the metal pick again. SAMANDIRIEL screams.


SAMANDIRIEL
Sah-teh-voch-leh.


CROWLEY twists the metal pick again and SAMANDIRIEL screams.


INT. GARTH’S BOAT – DAY


KEVIN is still working on the tablet. DEAN paces and claps his hands. KEVIN puts on headphones. DEAN looks at his watch.


DEAN
I mean, come on. How long's it take to get a calf skull from Egypt? Kevin. Kevin. [He snaps his fingers next to KEVIN’s ear and then leans down close to him.] Your mom's hot. I'm serious, your mom is one sexy –


DEAN’s phone rings.


DEAN (on phone)
Hey, I thought I told you to go underground.


EXT. PARK – DAY


A family is eating at a picnic table. BENNY stands under some trees nearby.


BENNY (on phone)
Hey. I am so far underground, I'm breathing through a straw, brother. Uh, look... what happened with your friend Martin back there, it wasn't supposed to go down that way.


INT. GARTH’S BOAT – DAY


DEAN (on phone)
I know. Your granddaughter told me.


The scene alternates between DEAN on GARTH’s boat and BENNY in the park.


BENNY (on phone)
Dean, you did this old dog a real solid, and, uh... the way you stood up for me –


DEAN (on phone)
Well, shoe on the other foot, you would have done the same.


BENNY (on phone)
Yeah. I hate to ask for much else, but I don't suppose there's any chance you're anywhere near the Catskills?


DEAN (on phone)
Working a case on the other side of the country. Why? What's up?


BENNY (on phone)
Yeah, just hitting a little rough patch, I guess. You know, doing this whole solo thing.


DEAN (on phone)
Benny... one day at a time, man.


BENNY (on phone)
You know what? Uh... A cup of coffee sure would do me good.


DEAN (on phone)
All right, as soon as I'm done with this case, I'll, uh... I'll be there, okay?


BENNY (on phone)
Yeah. All right, brother. Thank you.


DEAN hangs up. He walks over to KEVIN and touches his headphones.


DEAN
Hey. Where is your mom?


KEVIN
Somewhere safe.


DEAN
You kicked your mom to the curb?


KEVIN
She was too distracting. I couldn't focus. The angels said I had to go to the desert to learn the word of God, all right? So... this is my desert.


DEAN
Yeah, but your mom's your mom.


KEVIN
I can't enjoy a world I need to save, Dean. I can enjoy it when this is all over with. For right now... there's nothing more important than this.


EXT. DIFFERENT PARK – DAY


A man holds an umbrella over a woman as they walk along. SAM sits on a bench. CASTIEL appears next to SAM, who jumps.


CASTIEL
Watching humanity – it never gets old, does it?


INT. GARTH’S BOAT – DAY


DEAN tips the crumbs from a bag of snack food into his mouth and throws away the bag. There is the sound of wings.


CASTIEL
I got what we need.


DEAN
[turning] Well, it's about time.


SAM is standing next to CASTIEL.


DEAN
What's he doing here?


SAM
Don't worry, Dean. Once we save Alfie, I'm out.


DEAN
Oh, once "we" save Alfie. Don't hurt yourself, Sam. Cas and I can handle it.


SAM
Not according to Cas.


DEAN
I told you we didn't need him.


CASTIEL
We need everything, Dean. And I need both of you, as you say, to stow your crap. Can you do that?


DEAN and SAM look at each other.


ACT THREE
EXT. FACTORY – NIGHT


The IMPALA pulls up and parks. DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL get out. SAM was in his usual spot in the front passenger seat.


CASTIEL
So, there are four main points of warding – north, south, east, and west – and four Enochian symbols, like this... [he draws a symbol on SAM’s palm] ...that you need to destroy before I can enter.


DEAN
Okay, so, what? We go in, take care of the hell mooks, and you extract the angel?


CASTIEL
Yes. After killing so many, I need to save at least this one.


SAM
Sounds like a plan.


DEAN
Okay. [He takes out his demon-killing knife.] Let's do this.


CASTIEL
Wait. Here. [He gives his angel blade to SAM.] This doesn't just work on angels. It kills demons, too.


SAM
Thanks, Cas.


CUT TO:


A DEMON walks towards another DEMON who is standing next to a fire burning in a 44-gallon drum. Someone whistles and the first DEMON turns around and walks back to investigate. He reaches the corner of the building and sees DEAN standing on a short flight of stairs. DEAN waves. The DEMON’s eyes turn black and he moves towards DEAN, but SAM stabs the DEMON from behind with CASTIEL’s blade. Bright light flashes in the DEMON’s eyes as he dies.


DEAN
Well, not my most original work, but...


SAM takes keys from the DEMON’s body and tosses them to DEAN, who uses them to unlock a door to the building.


INT. FACTORY – NIGHT


DEAN and SAM walk through the factory. Symbols are painted on the walls. SAM uses spray paint to draw an “X” across a symbol like the one CASTIEL drew on SAM’s hand. DEAN then goes one way and SAM another.


CUT TO:


SAMANDIRIEL, who is still bound to the chair, screams. CROWLEY tightens one of the screws on the metal contraption on SAMANDIRIEL’s head.


SAMANDIRIEL
Voh-meh-pah-rah-less. Voh-meh-pah-rah-less.


VIGGO
What is it?


CROWLEY
That was tablet talk. Protecting the Word of God seems to be hardwired into these dingbats.


CROWLEY turns one of the screws and SAMANDIRIEL screams again.


CUT TO:


A DEMON walks down a hallway in the factory. SAMANDIRIEL’s screams can be heard. After the DEMON has passed by, DEAN steps out into the same hallway and uses spray paint to draw an “X” over the Enochian symbol.


CUT TO:


SAM walks through the factory. A DEMON sees him.


CUT TO:


DEAN walks through the factory. SAM walks in the opposite direction. SAM spray-paints over another Enochian symbol. The DEMON who was watching him grabs him from behind. SAM throws the DEMON to the floor and stabs it with CASTIEL’s blade. Bright light flashes inside its head as it dies. Another DEMON leaps on SAM from behind. DEAN grabs it and kills it with his demon-killing knife.


SAM
Thanks.


DEAN
Come on.


CUT TO:


CROWLEY tightens one of the screws on the metal contraption on SAMANDIRIEL’s head. SAMANDIRIEL groans loudly before going back into his trance.


SAMANDIRIEL
Zod-leh-fah.


CROWLEY
Demon tablet. Tell me one I don't know, huh?


CROWLEY turns one of the screws and SAMANDIRIEL screams.


CUT TO:


DEAN and SAM walk through the factory. SAMADIRIEL’s screams can be heard.


DEAN
Alfie.


They hear footsteps behind them and turn. Two DEMONS also come towards them from the front. DEAN spots two more coming from another direction. SAM ignites one of their demon bombs as DEMONS run towards them. He tosses it down the hallway towards the DEMONS coming in one direction as DEAN tosses one of his own at the other DEMONS. SAM and DEAN take shelter behind a wall. The bombs explode.


CUT TO:


VIGGO looks up at the sound of the explosion.


CUT TO:


The DEMONS are repelled backwards by the bomb, disintegrating as they go.


CUT TO:


VIGGO looks around as SAMANDIRIEL groans and screams.


CUT TO:


SAM and DEAN hear SAMANDIRIEL’s screams. SAM looks at the marks the DEMONS’ bodies left on the wall.


CUT TO:


VIGGO
M-M-Mr. Crowley, not that this isn't important, but perhaps we should be making preparations to leave. We – we seem to be under attack.


CROWLEY
Did you say something?


CROWLEY tightens one of the screws on the metal contraption on SAMANDIRIEL’s head and SAMANDIRIEL screams.


CUT TO:


DEAN and SAM walk down a hallway to the sound of SAMANDIRIEL’s screams. DEAN spray-paints over an Enochian symbol on a door.


DEAN
All right, anytime now, Cas.


CASTIEL appears, breathing heavily.


SAM
Cas! Hey! You okay?


CASTIEL
It must be the sigils. I'm not at full power.


DEAN
Sam, help me muss this crud.


CASTIEL
No, wait! There's no time. Samandiriel won't last much longer.


DEAN tries the lock on the door.


SAM
Cas. Here, take this. [He gives CASTIEL the angel blade.]


CASTIEL covers his ears and sees flashes of an instrument being held close to his eye. DEAN tries to open the door.


SAM
Dean, hurry up. Come on!


CUT TO:


CROWLEY tightens one of the screws on the metal contraption on SAMANDIRIEL’s head and SAMANDIRIEL screams.


CUT TO:


CASTIEL steps back towards the wall behind him. DEAN continues trying to open the door.


SAM
Dean.


CASTIEL sinks down into a crouch as he sees flashes of the instrument coming towards his eye and of himself screaming. DEAN slams a hand against the door.


DEAN
All right. Plan "B."


SAM
We have a plan "B"?


DEAN flings himself against the door, which doesn’t budge. SAM follows his lead and does the same. CASTIEL cowers on the floor.


CUT TO:


SAMANDIRIEL sits silent in the chair.


CROWLEY
As you were saying?


SAMANDIRIEL
Bah-nah-sah-ee.


CUT TO:


SAM flings himself against the door again.


DEAN
Cas? Anytime now.


CASTIEL is still cowering on the floor, seeing flashes of NAOMI holding the metal instrument close to his eye. DEAN hurls himself against the door.


CUT TO:


CROWLEY
Yes?


SAMANDIRIEL
Ar-doh-zah-feh.


CROWLEY
Spit it out, you heavenly pile of filth!


CUT TO:

DEAN continues to hurl himself against the door. CASTIEL is still cowering on the floor.


CUT TO:


SAMANDIRIEL
Pah-deh-rah.


CROWLEY
Holy mother of sin.


VIGGO
What? What is it?


CROWLEY
There's an angel tablet.

ACT FOUR
INT. FACTORY – NIGHT


From inside the room where SAMANDIRIEL is being held, we see the door move as DEAN and/or SAM continue to try to break in. VIGGO looks nervous. The door finally gives way and DEAN and SAM enter. CROWLEY has disappeared. VIGGO grabs a knife from his table of torture implements and grapples with DEAN. CASTIEL enters, looking weak, and goes to SAMANDIRIEL. Another DEMON enters and fights with SAM. VIGGO throws DEAN through a glass pane. CASTIEL loosens the screws on the metal contraption on SAMANDIRIEL’s head and removes a metal pick from his skull as SAM and DEAN continue to fight. CASTIEL flashes back to NAOMI holding a metal implement close to his eye and to himself screaming while bound to a chair.


NAOMI (in flashback)
Hold still.


CASTIEL continues to disassemble the metal contraption on SAMANDIRIEL’s head. DEAN straddles VIGGO and raises his demon-killing knife. VIGGO grabs DEAN by the throat. SAM sends the DEMON he is fighting flying into a trolley of torture implements. The DEMON grabs an implement from the trolley and rushes at SAM. CASTIEL removes the metal contraption from SAMANDIRIEL’s head. DEAN knocks VIGGO’s arm away and backhands him across the face. SAM sends his DEMON flying in DEAN’s direction and DEAN stands up and stabs the DEMON in the back, killing it. DEAN returns his attention to VIGGO.


VIGGO
Wait! I know – I know things.


DEAN
Cas! Go!


CASTIEL and SAMANDIRIEL disappear.


VIGGO
Good, good. There's so much you don't know. You need me.


DEAN nods.


DEAN
Yeah.


VIGGO nods.


DEAN
Yeah, I don't think so.


DEAN stabs VIGGO. Bright light flares inside VIGGO’s head as he dies.


EXT. FACTORY – NIGHT


CASTIEL supports SAMANDIRIEL, who is leaning against the IMPALA.


CASTIEL
It's okay. You're safe now. I'm taking you home.


SAMANDIRIEL
No. You can't take me back there, Castiel.


CASTIEL
Why not?


SAMANDIRIEL
You don't understand. I told Crowley things – things he shouldn't have known. He got to our coding, our secrets – secrets I didn't even know we had!


CASTIEL
What secrets?


SAMANDIRIEL
Heaven, Naomi.


CASTIEL
No. W-who's Naomi?


SAMANDIRIEL
Who is – listen to me. Listen to me closely. I've been there. I know! They're controlling us, Castiel!


CASTIEL
What do you mean?


INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE IN HEAVEN


NAOMI is leaning over CASTIEL, who is seated in a chair.


NAOMI
Kill him!


CASTIEL
What does he mean, they're controlling us?


NAOMI
Castiel!


CASTIEL
Who is controlling us? Why did I see your face? Why was I so afraid? What did you do to me?


NAOMI hauls CASTIEL to his feet.


NAOMI
This is a direct order! Kill him!


NAOMI pushes CASTIEL back into his chair. He disappears.


EXT. FACTORY – NIGHT


CASTIEL lets his angel blade slip down his sleeve and uses it to stab SAMANDIRIEL. Blinding white light emanates from SAMANDIRIEL as he dies.


INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE IN HEAVEN


CASTIEL
What did I just do?


NAOMI
You killed a traitor.


CASTIEL
Samandiriel... was good. And I was trying to atone for –


NAOMI
Samandiriel was broken. He revealed the existence of what I would die to protect – what any of us would die to protect. The angel tablet, Castiel. Crowley knows.


CASTIEL
I just murdered one of our own to protect a tablet?


NAOMI
If the demon tablet can seal demons in Hell, what do you think the angel tablet could do to us? You're a hero, Castiel. You've done Heaven a great service.


CASTIEL
And that's what I tell Sam and Dean?


EXT. FACTORY – NIGHT


CASTIEL is cradling SAMANDIRIEL’s body. SAM and DEAN run up.


SAM
Cas! What the hell happened?


INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE IN HEAVEN


NAOMI
You tell the Winchesters that Samandiriel had been compromised.


EXT. FACTORY – NIGHT


CASTIEL
He was compromised.


INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE IN HEAVEN


NAOMI
He came at you, and you acted in self-defense.


EXT. FACTORY – NIGHT


CASTIEL
[standing up] He came at me. I killed him in self-defense.


INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE IN HEAVEN


NAOMI
Say you must return his body to Heaven, and then bring him to me.


EXT. FACTORY – NIGHT


DEAN
Cas, you okay?


Blood trickles from the corner of one of CASTIEL’s eyes. CASTIEL wipes at it.


CASTIEL
My vessel must have been damaged in the melee. I have to go. Samandiriel's remains belong in Heaven.


INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE IN HEAVEN


NAOMI
I need to see just how far Crowley dug into him. Do you understand?


CASTIEL
Yes, I understand.


EXT. FACTORY – NIGHT


CASTIEL crouches down by SAMANDIRIEL’s body and puts an arm around his shoulders.


DEAN
Cas, wait.


CASTIEL
Thank you both... for everything you've done.


There is the sound of wings, and CASTIEL and SAMANDIRIEL disappear.


DEAN
Cas!


ACT FIVE
INT. RUFUS’ CABIN – DAY


SAM spray-paints the Enochian angel-warding symbol on the door.


SAM
Okay. That should do it. Cas can't see or hear us now.


DEAN
Okay, what the hell?


SAM
I know.


DEAN
I told you something was off with him since he got back from Purgatory.


SAM
So, what, you think someone's messing with him or something?


DEAN
Who?


SAM
Angels?


DEAN
Why would the angels have him kill another angel?


SAM shrugs.


DEAN
You know what, man? I got this. You go.


SAM
What?


DEAN
Don't you have a girl to get back to?


SAM
Yeah. I guess I do. Um... Since when are you on the Amelia bandwagon?


DEAN
I don't know. I'm just tired of all the fighting. [He takes a beer out of the refrigerator.] And, you know, maybe I'm a little bit jealous. I could never separate myself from the job like you could. Hell, maybe it's time for at least one of us to be happy.


SAM
What, you being such a big hugger and all? She does make me happy, and she could be waiting for me if I went back. I'd be a very lucky man if she was. But now... with everything staring down at us, with all that's left to be done... I don't know.


DEAN
Huh.


SAM
Yeah.


DEAN
Well, I do know this – whatever you decide, decide. Both feet in or both feet out. Anything in between is what gets you dead.


SAM
Yeah, I keep hearing that. I'm gonna... take a walk. Clear my head.


SAM leaves. DEAN sighs.


EXT. WATERFRONT – DAY


BENNY sucks from a blood bag. He puts the empty bag back into a cooler in which there is only one remaining full blood bag. BENNY picks up the full blood bag, then puts it back and closes the cooler and the doors on the back of his vehicle. His phone rings and he answers.


BENNY (on phone)
Dean. Thank you mightily, bud. I'm in a hard way here. How close are you?


The scene alternates between BENNY on the waterfront and DEAN in the cabin.


DEAN (on phone)
I'm sorry, man. I, um... I'm not gonna make it.


BENNY (on phone)
You mean now, or...?


DEAN (on phone)
Listen, Benny. Everything you've done for me, I will never forget, but, uh... This is it.


BENNY (on phone)
End of the line?


DEAN (on phone)
End of the line.


BENNY (on phone)
Yeah, well, I never liked these cellphones anyway.


DEAN (on phone)
You, uh... You stay good, all right?


BENNY (on phone)
You too, Dean. And, uh... Thanks for the ride.


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah, man. Adios.


INT. RUFUS’ CABIN – NIGHT


Boxing plays on the television. DEAN sits on the couch watching.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


AMELIA opens the door and looks sadly at the unoccupied room, then closes the door behind her as she leaves.


INT. RUFUS’ CABIN – NIGHT


SAM sets two bottles of beer and a bowl of food down on the coffee table in front of DEAN. DEAN removes the cap from one bottle and sets it down in front of SAM, then opens his own beer. SAM picks up his beer and he and DEAN look at each other. SAM nods. DEAN takes a drink from his beer and SAM follows suit. They eat.
