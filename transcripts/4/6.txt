TEASER
EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

Dean is seen running on the road, hearing growling and barking noises behind him. He turns around a corner, runs into a shopping cart and falls to the ground. He sees a homeless man rummaging through a garbage bin.

DEAN

Run! It'll kill you! (pointing)

Camera pans away from Dean to the homeless man, then to a pink-ribboned Yorkie. Dean starts running while shouting at the same time.

ACT ONE
43 HOURS EARLIER

INT. MORGUE – DAY

Coroner opens a body bag.

CORONER

Agent Tyler, Agent Perry, meet Frank O'Brien.

SAM

He died of a heart attack, right?

CORONER

Three days ago.

SAM

But O'Brien was 44 years old and, according to this ­ a marathon runner.

CORONER

Everybody drops dead sooner or later. It's why I got job security.

DEAN

Yeah, but Frank kicked it here. Now, just yesterday, two perfectly healthy men bit it in Maumee. All heart attacks, you don't think that's strange?

CORONER

Sounds like Maumee's problem to me. Why's the FBI give a damn, anyway?

DEAN

We just want to see the results of Frank's autopsy.

CORONER

What autopsy?

DEAN

The one you're gonna do.

Coroner cuts open the dead body.

CORONER

First dead body?

DEAN

Far from it.

CORONER

Oh, good. Because these suckers can get pretty ripe. Hey, hand me those

rib cutters, would you?

Sam takes a fortifying breath while Dean picks up the cutters and hands it to the Coroner. Coroner cuts the ribs open while Sam keeps himself from squirming.

DEAN

Is that from a wedding ring? I didn't think Frank was married.

CORONER

Ain't my department.

SAM

Any idea how he got these? (picks up Frank’s arm which is full of scratches)

CORONER

You know what? When you drop dead, you actually tend to drop. Body probably got scraped up when it hit the ground. Huh!

SAM

What?

CORONER

I-I can't find any blockages in any of the major arteries.

Coroner breaks off the heart while Dean tries not to vomit.

CORONER

Heart looks pretty damn healthy. (Hands heart to Dean) Hold that a second, would you? (Sam smirks on the side)

Coroner cuts something else in the body.

CORONER

(Hits Sam’s face with blood) Oh, sorry. Spleen juice. (Dean smirks)

INT. SHERIFF’S STATION – DAY

Sam & Dean sitting down in front of Deputy’s desk, waiting. Deputy smiles at Dean. Sheriff opens his office door.

SHERIFF

Hell's bells, Linus, have you seen my.... Who are they? (Sam & Dean stands)

DEPUTY LINUS

Federal agents. I, uh....

SHERIFF

And you kept them waiting?

DEPUTY LINUS

You, you said not to disturb.

SHERIFF

Come on back, fellas.

Sam & Dean walk over to Sheriff’s office but Sheriff stops them.

SHERIFF

Shoes off.

Sam & Dean take their shoes off and walk into Sheriff’s office.

SHERIFF BRITTON

Al Britton. Good to meet you. (shakes Dean & Sam’s hands)

SAM

You too.

Sheriff gestures for Sam & Dean to sit down.

SAM

Thank you.

Sheriff takes out alcohol gel and start slathering his hands. Dean looks at Sam with a weird look on his face.

SHERIFF BRITTON

Okay. So, what can I do for uncle Sam?

SAM

Well, we're looking into the death of Frank O'Brien. We understand some of

your men found his body.

SHERIFF BRITTON

They did. Me and Frank, we were friends. Hell, we were gamecocks.

Dean snickers. Sheriff gives him a stern look. Dean looks abashed.

SHERIFF BRITTON

That's our softball team's name. (Dean nods) They're majestic animals. I knew Frank since high school. To be honest, I just this morning got up the strength to go see him. Frank was...He was a good man.

DEAN

Yeah. Big heart.

SAM

Before he died, did you notice frank acting strange? Maybe scared of something?

SHERIFF BRITTON

Oh hell, yeah. Real jumpy.

SAM

You know what scared him?

SHERIFF BRITTON

No. Wouldn't answer his phone. Finally, I sent some of my boys over to check on him, and well, you know the rest.

Sheriff starts and pours alcohol gel on his hands again. Dean looks at Sam with a what “WTF?” look on his face.

SHERIFF BRITTON

(Slathering gel on his hands) So, why the Feds give a crap? You don't really think there's a case here?

DEAN

(Looks at Sam) No, no. It's probably nothing. Just a heart attack.

EXT. SAM & DEAN WALKING - DAY

DEAN

No way that was a heart attack.

SAM

Definitely no way. Three victims, all with those same red scratches. All went from jittery to terrified to dead within 48 hours.

DEAN

Something scared them to death?

SAM

All right, so what can do that?

DEAN

What can't? Ghosts, vampires, chupacabra? It could be a hundred things.

SAM

Yeah. So, we make a list and start crossing things off.

DEAN

Alright, who's the last person to see Frank O'Brien alive?

SAM

Uh, his neighbour, Mark Hutchins.

DEAN

(Seeing something ahead) Hang on, hang on.

SAM

What?

DEAN

(Facing Sam) I don't like the looks of those teenagers down there. (Sam looks around, sees teenagers talking near the Impala)

DEAN

Let's walk this way. (Crosses street while Sam stands with a perplexed look on his face)

INT. NEIGHBOUR’S HOUSE - DAY

MARK HUTCHINS

Tyler and Perry. Just like Aerosmith.

Dean is looking around the room.

SAM

Yeah, small world. So, the last time you saw Frank O'Brien? (Dean sees a big lizard and suddenly faces forward, swallowing)

MARK HUTCHINS

Monday, he was watching me from his window. I waved at him, but he just closed the curtains.

SAM

Hmm. did you speak to him recently? Did he seem different? Uh, scared?

MARK HUTCHINS

Oh, totally. He was freaking out.

Sam looks at Dean. Dean looks freaked out too.

DEAN

Do you know, uh..do you know what scared him?

MARK HUTCHINS

Well, yeah, witches.

SAM

Witches? (Sam & Dean look at each other) Like...?

MARK HUTCHINS

Well, "Wizard of Oz" was on tv the other night, right? And he said that green bitch was totally out to get him.

SAM

Anything else scare him?

MARK HUTCHINS

Everything else scared him. Al-Qaeda, ferrets, artificial sweetener. Those pez dispensers with their dead little eyes. Lots of stuff. (Dean looks around again at the animals inside the aquariums)

SAM

So, tell me. What was Frank like?

MARK HUTCHINS

I mean, he's dead, you know? I-I don't want to hammer him but, he got better.

SAM

He got better?

MARK HUTCHINS

Well, in high school he was, he was a dick.

SAM

A dick?

MARK HUTCHINS

Like a bully. I mean, he probably taped half the town's butt cheeks together,

Dean snickers.

MARK HUTCHINS

Mine included.

DEAN

So he pissed a lot of people off. You think anyone would have wanted to get revenge?

MARK HUTCHINS

Well, I don't...Frank had a heart attack, right?

SAM

Just answer the question, sir.

MARK HUTCHINS

No, I don't think so. Like I said, he got better. And after what happened to his wife.

DEAN

His wife? So he was married.

MARK HUTCHINS

She died about 20 years ago. Frank was really broken up about it.

Dean starts staring at the snake around Mark’s neck. Mark notices.

MARK HUTCHINS

Don't be scared of Donny. He's a sweetheart. It's Marie you got to look out for. (Nods to couch) She smells fear.

Albino snake creeps up from behind the couch. Dean sees it and gasps. Stays very still while it crawls down his lap.

EXT. IMPALA – NIGHT

Dean is sitting in the car reading while scratching on his left arm. Sam opens passenger door and climbs in.

SAM

Hey. Any luck at the county clerk's office?

DEAN

I'm not sure I'd call it luck. Frank's wife, Jessie, was a manic-depressive. She went off her meds back in '88 and vanished. They found her two weeks later, three towns over. Strung up in her motel room, suicide.

SAM

Any chance Frank helped her along to the other side?

DEAN

No, Frank was working the swing shift when she disappeared. Airtight alibi. (Turns on car)

Driving in the middle of town.

DEAN

How was Frank's pad?

SAM

Clean. Searched it top to bottom. No EMF, no hex bags, no sulfur.

DEAN

So probably no ghosts, no witches, no demons.

SAM

Pfh...

DEAN

3 down and 97 to go.

SAM

Yeah. (Sees speed Dean is driving in) Dude, you're going 20.

DEAN

And?

SAM

That's the speed limit.

DEAN

What? Safety's a crime now?

Drives through intersection, past their hotel.

SAM

Dude, where are you going? That was our hotel.

DEAN

Sam, I'm not gonna make a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. I'm not suicidal.

Sam gives Dean a confused look.

DEAN

Did I just say that? That was kind of weird.

EMF goes off in the background.

SAM

Do you hear something? (Takes out EMF meter, moves it from and to Dean where it makes a sound)

DEAN

Am I haunted? Am I haunted?!

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXT. IN FRONT OF HOTEL – DAY

Sam is on the phone talking to Bobby. Hears music from the Impala and walks towards it. See Dean lying on the front seat doing air drums to Eye of the Tiger. Bangs on the roof of the car and scares Dean.

DEAN

Dude. Look at this. (Shows scratches on arm)

SAM

I just talked to Bobby.

DEAN

And? (Smells box of donuts and throws into car)

SAM

(Looking perplexed at Dean ignoring the donuts) Um, well, you're not gonna like it.

DEAN

What?

SAM

It's ghost sickness.

DEAN

Ghost sickness?

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

God, no.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

I don't even know what that is.

SAM

Okay. Some cultures believe that certain spirits can infect the living with a disease, which is why they stopped displaying bodies in houses and started taking them off to funeral homes.

DEAN

Okay, get to the good stuff.

SAM

Symptoms are you get anxious...

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Then scared, then really scared, then your heart gives out. Sound familiar?

DEAN

Yeah, but Sam, we haven't seen a ghost in weeks.

SAM

Well, I doubt you caught it from a ghost. Look, once a spirit infects that first person, Ghost sickness can spread like any sickness through a cough, a handshake, whatever. It's like the flu. Now, Frank O'Brien was the first to die, which means he was probably the first infected. Patient zero.

DEAN

Our very own outbreak monkey.

SAM

Right. Get this, Frank was in Maumee over the weekend. Softball tournament. Which is where he must have infected the other two victims.

DEAN

Were they gamecocks?

SAM

Cornjerkers.

DEAN

So, ghosts infected Frank. He passed it on to the other guys and I got it from his corpse?

SAM

Right.

DEAN

So now what, I have 48 hours before I go insane and my heart stops?

SAM

More like 24.

DEAN

Super.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Well, why me? Why not you? I mean, you got hit with the spleen juice.

SAM

Yeah, um, you see Bobby and I have a theory about that too. Turns out all three victims shared a certain, uh, personality type. Frank was a bully. The other two victims, one was a vice principal, the other was a bouncer.

DEAN

Okay.

SAM

Basically, they were all dicks.

DEAN

So you're saying I'm a dick?

SAM

No, no, no. It's not just that. All three victims used fear as a weapon, and now this disease is just returning the favor.

DEAN

I don't scare people.

SAM

Dean, all we do is scare people.

DEAN

Okay, well then, you're a dick too.

SAM

Apparently, I'm not.

DEAN

Whatever. How do we stop it?

SAM

We gank the ghost that started all this. We do that, the disease should clear up.

DEAN

You thinking Frank's wife?

SAM

Who knows why she killed herself, you know? Hey, what are you doing waiting out here, anyway?

DEAN

(Looks up at the hotel) Our room's on the fourth floor.

Sam looks and shakes head.

DEAN

It's...it’s high.

SAM

I'll see if I can move us down to the first.

DEAN

Thanks.

SAM

Sure.

Dean climbs into the Impala and looks at donuts.

INT. HOTEL ROOM – DAY

Dean sits at table with book in front of him. Stares at wall clock ticking loudly in the background. Goes back to reading and starts coughing when he sees disturbing images. Sees words that seem to be talking to him and starts to panic. Irritatingly looks back at the clock.

Scene fades to black with sound of something breaking in the background.

Sam comes into room, sees broken clock on floor. Dean is on the sofa drinking beer.

SAM

Everything all right?

DEAN

Oh,yeah. Just peachy. Find anything?

SAM

Yeah, Jessie O'Brien's body was cremated, so I'm pretty sure she is not our ghost. Hey, quit picking at that. How you feeling?

DEAN

Awesome. It's nice to have my head on the chopping block again. I almost forgot what that feels like.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

It's freaking delightful.

SAM

We'll keep looking.

Dean starts to cough.

SAM

You okay? Hey!

Dean starts to choke.

SAM

Dean.

Dean is gagging over the sink where he spits out a wood chip.

SAM

We've been completely ignoring the biggest clue we have, you.

DEAN

I don't want to be a clue.

SAM

The abrasions, this, the disease, it's trying to tell us something.

DEAN

Tell us what, wood chips?

SAM

Exactly.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE LUMBER MILL – DAY

Dean looks at the mill apprehensively.

DEAN

I'm not going in there.

SAM

I need backup, and you're all I've got. You're going in, Dean.

DEAN

(Takes a drink of whiskey) Let's do this. It is a little spooky, isn't it?

Sam hands Dean a gun.

DEAN

Oh, I'm not carrying that. It could go off. I'll man the flashlight.

SAM

You do that.

INT. INSIDE THE LUMBER MILL - DAY

EMF goes off in the background.

DEAN

EMF's not gonna work with me around, is it?

SAM

You don't say. Come on.

SAM

Wait...(startles Dean). "To Frank. Love, Jessie." Frank O'Brien's ring.

DEAN

What the hell was Frank doing here?

SAM

No idea.

Walks into a room full of lockers where they hear rustling. Sam opens a locker and Dean screams after being startled by a cat.

DEAN

That was scary! (Sam walks away) Wait.

SAM

(Looking at an ID card) Luther Garland.

DEAN

(Sees drawing on table) Hey, this is uh...this is Frank's wife.

SAM

Plot thickens.

DEAN

Yeah, but into what?

Dean tears off the drawing and machines turn on. Looking around he sees something in the corner. Sam looks at Dean and sees him looking behind him, he turns around and sees the same thing.

SAM

Hey! (Turns around and sees Dean running out the mill)

Sam shoots the apparition and goes after Dean who is hiding behind the Impala taking another drink.

SAM

Guess we got the right place.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. SHERIFF’S STATION – DAY

DEPUTY LINUS

(Hands folder to Sam) This is the Garland file. (Sees Dean swaying) Is he...drunk?

SAM

No. Deputy, according to this, Luther Garland's cause of death was physical trauma. What does that mean?

DEPUTY LINUS

The guy died 20 years ago, before my time. Sorry.

SAM

Then can we talk to the sheriff?

DEPUTY LINUS

Um, he's out sick today.

SAM

Well, if you see him, will you have him call us? We're staying at the Bluebird. Mind if I take this?

DEAN

Know what? You're awesome.

DEPUTY LINUS

Thanks. Um, y-you too, I guess.

SHERIFF BRITTON (Over the intercom)

Who was that?

DEPUTY LINUS

It’s uh, those FBI guys.

SHERIFF BRITTON

What did they want?

DEPUTY LINUS

A file, Luther Garland's. Sheriff?

Inside Sheriff Britton’s office.

(VOICE OVER)

SHERIFF BRITTON

They know. They know. They know what you did, and they're gonna make you pay.

INT. PEACEFUL PINES ASSISTED LIVING – NIGHT

Sam & Dean are walking inside. Dean is startled by a resident that they bump into in the hallway.

DEAN

This isn't gonna work. Come on, these badges are fake. What if we get busted?

We could go to jail.

SAM

Dean, shh! Calm down. Deep breath, okay? (Dean takes a deep breath.) There. You feel better? (Dean shakes his head no.) Just come on. Don't scratch.

SAM

Mr. Garland. Hi uh, I'm Agent Tyler. This is Agent Perry, FBI. We'd like to ask you a few questions about your brother Luther.

MR. GARLAND

Let me see some I.D.

SAM

Certainly.

DEAN

Those are real, obviously. I mean, who would pretend to be an FBI agent, huh? That's just nutty.

MR. GARLAND

What do you want to know?

SAM

Uh, well...according to this, your brother Luther died of physical trauma. (Mr. Garland scoffs)

SAM

You don't agree.

MR. GARLAND

No, I don't.

SAM

Well, then, what would you call it?

MR. GARLAND

Don't matter what an old man thinks.

SAM

Mr. Garland. We're just trying to get the truth on your brother. Please.

MR. GARLAND

Everybody was scared of Luther. They called him a monster. (FLASHBACK) He was too big, too mean-looking. Just too different. Didn't matter he was the kindest man I ever knew. Didn't matter he'd never hurt no one. (END FLASHBACK) A lot of people failed Luther. I was one of them. I was a widower with three young 'uns. And I told myself there was nothing I could do.

SAM

Mr. Garland, um...do you recognize this woman?

MR. GARLAND

It's Jessie O'Brien. Her man, Frank, killed Luther.

SAM

How do you know that?

MR. GARLAND

Everybody knows. They just don't talk about it. (FLASHBACK) Jessie was a

receptionist at the mill. She was always real nice to Luther, and he had a crush on her. (END FLASHBACK) But Frank didn't like it. And when Jessie went missing, Frank was sure that Luther had done something to her. Turns out the old gal killed herself, but Frank didn't know that. (FLASHBACK OF LUTHER BEING DRAGGED) They found Luther with a chain wrapped around his neck. He was dragged up and down the stretch outside that plant till he was past dead.

DEAN

And O'Brien was never arrested?

MR. GARLAND

I screamed to every cop in town. They didn't want to look into Frank. He was a pillar of the community. My brother was just the town freak.

SAM

You must have hated Frank O'Brien.

MR. GARLAND

I did for a long time, but life's too short for hate, son. And frank wasn't thinking straight. His wife had vanished, he was terrified. A damn shame he had to put Luther through the same, but...that's fear. It spreads and spreads.

EXT. PEACEFUL PINES - NIGHT

DEAN

Now we know what these are, road rash. And I'm guessing Luther

swallowed some wood chips when he was being dragged down that road.

SAM

Makes sense. You're experiencing his death in slow motion.

DEAN

Yeah well, not slow enough, huh? Say we burn some bones and get me healthy.

SAM

Dean, it won't be that easy.

DEAN

No, no, it'll be that easy. Why wouldn't it be that easy?

SAM

Luther was road-hauled. His body was ripped to pieces. He was probably scattered all over that road. There's no way we're gonna find all the remains.

DEAN

You're kidding me.

SAM

Look, we'll just have to figure something else out.

DEAN

You know what? Screw this.

SAM

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dean.

DEAN

Come on. No, I mean, come on, Sam. What are we doing?!

SAM

We're hunting a ghost.

DEAN

A ghost, exactly! Who does that?

SAM

Us.

DEAN

Us? Right. And that Sam, that is exactly why our lives suck. I mean, come on, we hunt monsters! What the hell?! I mean, normal people, they see a monster, and they run. But not us, no, no, no, we -- we search out things that want to kill us. Yeah? Huh? Or eat us! You know who does that? Crazy people! We...are insane! You know, and then there's the bad diner food and then the skeevy motel rooms and then the truck-stop waitress with the bizarre rash. I mean, who wants this life, Sam? Huh? Seriously? Do you actually like being stuck in a car with me eight hours a day, every single day? I don't think so! I mean, I drive too fast. And I listen to the same five albums over and over and over again, a-and I sing along. I'm annoying, I know that. And you --you're gassy! You eat half a burrito, and you get toxic! I mean, you know what? (tosses Sam the keys) You can forget it.

SAM

Whoa, Dean. where are you going?

DEAN

Stay away from me Sam, okay? Cause I am done with it. I'm done with the monsters and -- and -- and the hellhounds and the ghost sickness and the damn apocalypse. I'm out. I'm done. Quit.

Deans is walking when he hears growling behind him.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

SAM

I looked everywhere for you, Dean. How the hell did you get here?

DEAN

Ran. What do we do now? I got less than four hours on the clock. I'm gonna die, Sammy.

SAM

Yeah, you are. (Dean looks puzzled) You're going back.

DEAN

Back?

SAM

Downstairs Dean, hell. It's about damn time, too. Truth is, (Sam turns to Dean with yellow-eyes) You've been a real pain in my ass. (Throws Dean against wall with a hand gesture)

DEAN

No! You get out of my brother, you evil son of a bitch!

YELLOW-EYED SAM

No one's possessing me, Dean. This is what I'm going to become. This is what I want to become. There's nothing you can do about it. (Starts to choke Dean)

SAM

Hey, hey, hey, Dean. Hey, Dean. Dean. Dean.

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
EXT. OUTSIDE LUMBER MILL – DAY

Sam is sitting on the Impala as a car drives up.

BOBBY

Howdy, Sam.

SAM

Hey, Bobby. Thanks for coming so quick.

BOBBY

Where's Dean?

SAM

Uh, home sick.

Scene shifts to Dean sitting inside the hotel watching TV.

DEAN

(Sees Pokey being lassoed and dragged) Oh, this isn't helping.

Back to the lumber mill.

BOBBY

So, have his hallucinations started yet?

SAM

Yeah, a few hours ago.

BOBBY

How we doing on time?

SAM

We saw the coroner about 8:00 a.m. Monday morning, so, uh...just under two hours. What about you? You find anything?

BOBBY

This uh, encyclopaedia of spirits dates to the Edo period. (Gives Sam a book with Japanese text)

SAM

You can read Japanese?

BOBBY

(Answers in Japanese)

SAM

Guess so, show-off.

BOBBY

Anyway, this book lists a kind of ghost that could be our guy. It uh, infects people with fear. It's called a Buru Buru.

SAM

It say how to kill it?

BOBBY

Same as usual. Burn the remains.

SAM

Wonderful. Uh...is there a Plan "B"?

BOBBY

Well, the Buru Buru is born of fear. Hell, it is fear. And the lore says we

can kill it with fear.

SAM

So we have to scare a ghost to death?

BOBBY

Pretty much.

SAM

How the hell we gonna do that?

Back at the hotel room, Dean’s cellphone rings.

DEAN

Hey.

SAM

Hey! So, uh, just ride out the trip, okay? You're -- you're gonna be fine. We got a plan.

DEAN

What is it?

SAM (Voice on phone)

Uh, just a good plan, all right? Hang in there.

Back at the mill.

BOBBY

This is a terrible plan.

SAM

Yeah, tell me about it.

BOBBY

I know I said, "scare the ghost to death" but this?

SAM

Hey, you got a better idea, I'm listening.

Sam enters the mill when a hand comes up behind a glass window that shows Luther’s reflection.

Meanwhile, back at the hotel, Dean starts to hear barking. The door rattles then breaks off its hinges.

DEAN

Sheriff? (Sees gun in Sheriff’s hand) What are you doing?

SHERIFF BRITTON

Why are you looking into Luther Garland's death?

DEAN

(Sees blood on Sheriff’s right arm) Hey, hey, you're -- you're sick. You're sick. You're sick, all right? Just -- just like me, okay? You got to relax.

SHERIFF BRITTON

(Hits Dean) Frank O'Brien was my friend. So he made a mistake. So I didn't bust him. So what? And you're gonna bring me down over that?! No, sir. (Points gun at Dean but Dean swats it away)

Fight ensues.

SHERIFF BRITTON (VOICE OVER)

They know what you did.

SHERIFF BRITTON

(Starts to hyperventilate) Get away from me!

DEAN

Al, you got to calm down!

SHERIFF BRITTON

Step back! (Is having a heart attack)

SHERIFF BRITTON (VOICE OVER)

They know...

At the lumber mill.

BOBBY (OVER THE WALKIE TALKIE)

Any luck?

SAM

I don't know what's wrong, Bobby. Last time he came right at us. It's almost like he's, uh...like he's scared. (Puts down shotgun)

BOBBY

So now what?

SAM

I guess I got to make him angry. Hey, Luther! (Start to tear up drawings. Machines turn on) Come on, Luther! Where the hell are you? What are you waiting for? (Turns around and sees Luther)

INT. HOTEL

Dean is sitting on the bed scratching his arms. Hears again what Sam said during his hallucination earlier.

SAM (VOICE OVER)

You're going back. It’s about damn time too. Hahahaha.

Hears barking. Looks down on his watch and sees something on the floor. Picks it up and sees it’s the Bible.

LITTLE GIRL

Hi, Dean.

DEAN

Huh, no! No!

LITTLE GIRL

Yes! It's me, Lilith. (Embraces Dean) Oh, I missed you so much. It's time to go back now.

DEAN

(Moves away from Lilith) You – you are not real!

LILITH

What's the matter, Dean? Don't you remember all the fun you had down there? You do remember. 4 months is like 40 years in hell. Like doggy years. And you remember every second.

DEAN

(Clutches his chest) You are not real.

LILITH

It doesn't matter. You're still gonna die. You're still gonna burn.

DEAN

Why me? Why'd I get infected?

LILITH

Silly goose. You know why, Dean. Listen to your heart.

DEAN

Whu...?

LILITH

Baboom, baboom, baboom, baboom.

Back at the mill, Sam is fighting Luther’s spirit. Scene shifts to hotel room with Lilith taunting Dean. Back again to the mill where Sam manages to wrap the chain around Luther’s neck.

SAM

Bobby, punch it!

Bobby floors the Impala and pulls Luther’s spirit across the road until he disappears. At the same time Dean recovers in the hotel room.

END ACT FOUR

EPILOGUE
EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY

DEAN

So you guys road-hauled a ghost with a chain?

SAM

Iron chain etched with spell work.

DEAN

Hmm, that's a new one.

SAM

It was what he was most afraid of. It was pretty brutal, though.

DEAN

On the upside, I'm still alive, so uh, go team!

SAM

Yeah. How you feeling, by the way?

DEAN

Fine.

BOBBY

You sure, Dean? 'Cause this line of work can get awful scary.

DEAN

I'm fine. You want to go hunting? I'll hunt. I'll kill anything.

BOBBY

Awwww, he's adorable. I got to get out of here. You boys drive safe.

SAM

You too, Bobby. Hey, thanks.

Bobby drives off.

SAM

So uh...so, what did you see? Near the end, I mean.

DEAN

Oh, besides a cop beating my ass?

SAM

Seriously.

Dean looks at Sam and sees a yellow flash in his eyes.

DEAN

Howler monkeys. Whole roomful of them. Those things creep the hell out of me.

SAM

Right.

DEAN

No, just the usual stuff, Sammy. Nothing I can’t handle.
