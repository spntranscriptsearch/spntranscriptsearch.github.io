Teaser
A dark, smoky alleyway [We see a hooded figure with a sword sticking out of their backpack enter the alleyway and duck behind a dumpster. Then two men enter looking for the hooded person. We see it’s Charlie when she slides off her hood. One of the men takes out a special compass. After it points to the direction, he puts it away, takes out his gun and points in the direction to the other man who already has his gun out. They go further into the alley and one man begins to look into the dumpsters. When he lifts the 2nd dumpster lid, Charlie stands up and stabs him in the neck with her sword. She jumps out of the dumpster and kicks him out of the way and slashes the gun hand of the first man (Jacob Styne) causing him to drop his gun. He laughs. Charlie points the sword at his chest.]
CHARLIE

Who the hell are you? And why are you following me?

JACOB

I ain’t following you. I’m following what you got in your bag there. That don’t belong to you, girl. Belongs to my family.

CHARLIE

Yeah? Well, sorry Gambit. Finders keepers.

JACOB

It’s beyond your understanding. Hell, you can’t even read it.

CHARLIE

Are you always so condescending when someone’s pointing a blade at you?

JACOB

Now you look here. You can cut me down, but my people will never stop. [He raises his hands.] And you can tiptoe through the tulips like you did in Russia, or you can stow away on the back of a train like you did in Alaska, but soon enough my kin will find you. [Charlie notices his tattoo on his wrist.] This ends with you being dead. [Jacob grabs the sword away from Charlie. As she runs away, he picks up his gun and shoots at her back.]

CHARLIE

Aah! [She’s hit in the back but climbs through a hole in the fence and runs.]

JACOB

[He runs to the fence and keeps shooting.] You can’t run forever little girl.

SUPERNATURAL TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
[Interior of Castiel’s car. Castiel is driving and Metatron is sitting in the passenger seat.]

RADIO VOICE

Our flashback playback continues with a song that climbed all the way to number four on the charts. Here’s Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic.” [Castiel turns off the radio.]

METATRON

Really? That song is a classic. Yeah I hear you. I do. And you’re right. Inclement weather on the day of your nuptials and the wrong cutlery at inopportune times is hardly ironic. But it sure is catchy. Yeah, fair point. Can’t argue taste. But since I became human, it’s just so….strange. All these feelings, you know? I mean, I can feel music. Like that last song, “Sussudio.” I don’t even know what it’s about and I love it. I always enjoyed lyrics, words, stories. Gives me goose bumps. And Goosebumps – don’t even get me started on those. Creepy! And yet….arousing. [Castiel pulls out his cell phone and makes a call.]

[Interior of the Men of Letter’s Library. Sam is at a laptop and answers his cell phone]

SAM

Cas?

CASTIEL [in his car]

Can I just kill him now?

METATRON

You know I can hear you, right?

SAM

No, we need him alive for now. Look, after he gives you your Grace back, you can do whatever you want with him.

CASTIEL

Well, I’d like to kill him slowly.

METATRON

I am like two feet from you.

CASTIEL

Anything on the Mark of Cain?

METATRON

Every word – crystal clear.

SAM

No. I mean, I’ve been digging for something, for anything, but… I don’t know Cas.

CASTIEL

There is an answer out there. We will find a cure for Dean.

METATRON

I don’t know why you’d want to cure that little firecracker now. He’s finally interest…[Castiel punches Metatron in the face] Ooh!

CASTIEL

Well, just keep digging.

SAM

[Sam looks up and Dean is entering the library.] Yeah, uh, no one here by that name. Sorry. [Sam hangs up.]

CASTIEL

Sam?

METATRON

Lose reception? Or did he hang up on you? [Castiel turns and looks at Metatron. Metatron begins laughing.] He hung up on you, didn’t he? [Castiel punches Metatron in the face again.] Ooh!

[Interior Men of Letters Library]

SAM

So, I’ve been checking through everything again, double-checking and triple-checking, and…

DEAN

The Mark is a curse.

SAM

Yeah, tell me about it.

DEAN

No, Sam, it’s a… it’s an actual curse.

SAM

What are you talking about?

DEAN

Crowley told me. Or rather, Rowena told him after she tried and failed to kill me.

SAM

What the hell happened?

DEAN

The Mark protected me. Rowena doesn’t really have a beef with me. She was pissed at Crowley because she thinks he’s going soft.

SAM

She’s not wrong.

DEAN

Yeah, well, after he and Mommy Dearest got into a fight…

SAM

Mommy Dearest?

DEAN

Rowena is Crowley’s mother. (SAM looks surprised.) More about that later. So, then he came and told me what she had said. The Mark is an actual curse. So, anyway, I’m sorry. I probably should’ve told you that.

SAM

Yeah.

Dean

Yeah. [Sam’s cell phone rings. Dean takes the phone and answers.] Winchester Accounting. How may I help you?

CHARLIE’S VOICE ON CELLPHONE

Dean?

DEAN

Charlie? What’s going on? Where are you?

[Charlie is in a phone booth.]

CHARLIE

Uh, uh, I’m exhausted and….and I’m bleeding. And I’m in a phone booth. A phone booth. I didn’t know these things existed outside of Bill and Ted’s…

DEAN

[He turns the phone on speaker.] Okay. Hey, hey. Take a deep breath, kiddo. Uh, we’re both sitting here. Tell me what happened. Why are you bleeding?

CHARLIE

I, uh – I got shot. Did you know dental floss works great on stitches? I only passed out twice, and I’m pretty sure my wound is now minty fresh.

SAM

Charlie, you probably need to go to a hospital.

CHARLIE

No, no, I-I’m fine. I just got to get someplace safe. These guys are still after me.

SAM

What guys? Who?

CHARLIE

Some southern fried d-bags. They’ve been after me since I dug up “The Book of the Damned.”

SAM

You found it? Where?

CHARLIE

After some near misses and some broken into museums, I found historical documents that led to a monastery in Spain. It burned down years ago, left for dead, but, uh, I had this hunch about it. Turned out I was right.

DEAN

Okay, Charlie, what does it say about the Mark?

CHARLIE

I have no fracking idea. The language it’s written in, I’ve never seen anything like it. I, uh, I found some research notes in the monastery crypt, though, by the Friar that buried it. “The Book of the Damned” is a spell book for creating or undoing any kind of damnation there is. We translate this thing, I think we can get the Mark of Cain off you, Dean.

DEAN

Charlie, you’re a genius.

CHARLIE

A genius fugitive. I – these dudes following me, they are well trained. One of them keeps talking about his family.

DEAN

Family? Did you get a name?

CHARLIE

No clue. I-I-I spotted a tattoo on one of them. Might be a family crest. It seemed occulty. Soon as the book was out of the ground, they were all over me. I, uh….I don’t know how much more running I got left in me. T-they’re tracking the book somehow.

SAM

Alright, then we need to get you off the grid, Charlie. Where are you right now?

CHARLIE

Uh, just south of Des Moines.

DEAN

Uh, okay, you know what? Our -- our friend, Bobby, has a whole bunch of cabins scattered all around, places for hunters to crash. You know, it’s not much, but there’s some gear and lore books, stuff to keep you busy til we get there.

CHARLIE

Okay, bring snacks. And every Men of Letters decoder ring there is. This book is old and scary, and I’ve never seen anything like it.

ACT TWO
[Sam is packing files in a file box in the Library. Dean walks in carrying a box.]

Hey, check it out. I found this in the storage room. It’s lead-lined and warded. If those guys are tracking this book, pretty sure this bad boy will take it off the radar. You ready?

[The Impala is driving down a road at night. “The Boys are Back in Town” by Thin Lizzy is playing. It cuts to the interior of the Impala.]

DEAN

What?

SAM

Nothing. [He shuts off the radio.] Nothing, I just haven’t seen you like this in a while, that’s all.

DEAN

It’s a good song, man. Shut up.

SAM

Yeah, it’s….

DEAN

Look, man, it has been one crap sandwich after another for the past few weeks, okay? You heard Charlie. We got a shot at fixing this thing, so if that don’t put gas in your tank, well…

SAM

If by “shot” you mean a spell in a book that we can’t read that’s currently being tracked…

DEAN

We’re due for a win, okay? Overdue. I’ll tell you another thing, if this actually does work, we’re gonna take some time off.

SAM

What, like a vacation?

DEAN

Mm-hmm. And I’m not talking just like a weekend in Vegas or sitting in some crap motel watching pay-per-porn. No, I’m talking about a beach. Drinking cervezas, go for a swim, mingle with the local wildlife. When was the last time either one of us was on a beach?

SAM

Never.

DEAN

Sand between our toes, Sammy. Sand between our toes. [Dean turns the radio back on and “Boys are Back in Town” is still playing. We then see the Impala heading down the road]

[Interior of a diner. Castiel and Metatron are at a table. Metatron is eating waffles with whipped cream, strawberries, and blueberries on top.]

METATRON

Mmmmmm! O…M…Me! Oh. Food. Glorious Food. Mmm. All the countless descriptions in so many books, but those are just words. Oh, the taste, the – the actual taste…. I had no idea. Oh. And the process. Goes in here [he points to his mouth]…comes out here [points toward his rear]. Sorcery. I mean, you used to be human. Don’t you miss all this?

CASTIEL

No. I don’t miss digestion. I don’t miss indigestion.

METATRON

No, no, no. Not that. I mean, don’t you miss the feeling of all this? Like the taste of these waffles. The sound of a child’s laughter. Look at us. We’re a couple of angels who’ve touched not only the divine, but the mundane. You and I have a lot in common.

CASTIEL

Don’t.

METATRON

What? I thought we were having a moment. Can’t we be besties?

CASTIEL

No. Because you killed my friend.

METATRON

Oh pfhht. Dean is fine, mostly. Can’t you get past that?

CASTIEL

Never. Now we’ve hit three of your so-called safe houses, and all of them are empty. So either you’ve lost my Grace or you’re stalling.

METATRON

Can you blame me? The minute I hand over your Grace, I’m dead.

CASTIEL

You have made your bed, Metatron, and nothing is going to get you out of it. [Loud digestive noises are coming from Metatron.] What are you doing?

METATRON

I think I need to use the little boys’ room. [He holds up his handcuffed hands in front of him.] Little help. [Castiel helps him get up and leads him to the bathroom. A man who looks like a trucker is sitting at the counter. He watches them go past, then opens his denim jacket to reveal an angel blade.]

[The Impala pulls up in front of a cabin by a lake. Sam and Dean enter the Cabin.]

DEAN

Charlie?

CHARLIE

[She was sleeping at a table and bolts up with a post-it note on her face.] Merry Christmas!

DEAN

Hey

CHARLIE

Were you followed?

DEAN

No, no.

SAM

How are you feeling?

CHARLIE

Um….I may have just passed out, but better.

DEAN

Where’s the book?

CHARLIE

Okay, here’s what I’ve learned so far. About 700 years ago, a nun locked herself away after having visions of darkness. After a few decades squirrelled away by herself, she emerged with this. [Charlie pulls the book out of her backpack.] Each page is made out of slices of her own skin written in her blood. I told you, it’s eekish. [She hands the book to Sam. He begins flipping the pages and Dean seems to be strangely affected by it.] According to the notes I found, it’s been owned and used by cults, covens, and the Vatican had it for a while. There’s a spell inside that thing for everything. Talking some black mass, dark magic, end-of-times nastiness. As far as what language it’s written in, I’m thinking it’s some kind of…uh…

SAM

Dean? Dean!

DEAN

[He’s across the room and looks up from the book suddenly in his hands.] What? [Sam and Charlie exchange concerned glances.] I don’t think it’s a good idea that I touch this. [Dean closes the book and hands it back to Charlie.] I’ll go get the rest of our crap.

SAM

Right. [Dean exits the cabin.]

CHARLIE

What the hell was that?

SAM

He’s not getting better. He’s trying to cover, but… We need to find that cure, fast. [Sam takes the book from Charlie.]

[Exterior of the Diner. Castiel and Metatron exit the Diner.]

METATRON

Sorry about the mess. I guess I’m lactose intolerant.

CASTIEL

Let’s never speak of it again. [The man from the Diner is leaning on Castiel’s car.]

ANGRY CUPID

Metatron and Castiel. This really must be my lucky day. Two birds, one blade. [He pulls his angel blade out from his denim jacket. Castiel pulls his angel blade out from his trench coat.]

CASTIEL

Who are you?

ANGRY CUPID

Just a cupid. Just an angry, angry cupid.

CASTIEL

I understand you’re upset.

ANGRY CUPID

You both corrupted Heaven. It’s never gonna be the same! [He tries to strike Castiel with his angel blade. They fight. He goes to stab Metatron with his blade and Castiel knocks him down and he drops his angel blade and they both fall. The Angry Cupid gets Castiel’s blade away from him and is about to stab Castiel. Metatron stabs him in the back with the angel blade he had dropped. Castiel picks up his angel blade and Metatron hands Castiel the Angry Cupid’s blade.]

METATRON

I owed you that one, anyway.

CASTIEL

[This changes nothing. [Castiel gets up and walks toward his car with both angel blades.]

METATRON

You’re welcome.

ACT THREE
[Interior of the cabin.]

CHARLIE

Okay, I got a pretty good look at his tattoo. It’s something like this. [Charlie hands Dean a piece of paper with a drawing of the tattoo. He’s opening the box with the files.]

DEAN

The douche clan. Got it. Well this is everything the Men of Letters had on occult families, so there should be something in here.

CHARLIE

Sam, got anything?

SAM

Maybe. Uh, yeah, it’s all in an obscure Sumerian dialect. Actually found a rough match for it in this book.

CHARLIE

Great.

SAM

I thought so, too. But I’ve been translating, but none of the translated words make any sense. It’s all just gibberish. I mean, maybe it’s in a different dialect?

CHARLIE

No, no, no. You’re right, but I-I-I think….I think this is in code.

SAM

An entire book of unreadable text that’s also in code. Great.

DEAN

And you call yourselves nerds. Come on. You got this.

CHARLIE

He’s right. Let’s get our Alan Turing on. Decript this bitch. [Sam notices Dean staring at the book.]

SAM

You know what, Charlie? Why, uh… Um, why don’t we stick with my notes for a little bit? This book is literally making my eyes hurt. [Sam puts the book in the lockbox.]

[A truck pulls into a gas station parking lot. Jacob and a man get out. Jacob is looking around.]

MAN

What is it?

JACOB

Shh. [Jacob takes out his compass, but it just spins. He closes the compass.] Damn it. She found a way to hide the book. It was here. It was on this road. She was on this road. Send the boys up and down the way. See if anybody saw her.

[Castiel and Metatron are entering a dark library.]

CASTIEL

Oh, come on. You expect me to believe that you hid my Grace in a library?

METATRON

Nobody goes to libraries anymore. It’s the safest place in the world.

CASTIEL

[Castiel turns on the lights.] I can feel my Grace. It’s here but you’ve hidden it somehow. Where is it?

METATRON

Honestly, I have no idea. [Castiel pushes Metatron into a chair and squeezes the wound from the shot on his injured leg.] Aah! Aah!

CASTIEL

Where is it?

METATRON

Oh! Gah! I don’t know, I swear! I had another angel hide it, even from me. [Castiel squeezes the leg even harder.] Aah! You know, in case someone tries to torture the information out of me! Case in point!

CASTIEL

Where is my Grace?

METATRON

I told the angel to hide some clues in some of my favorite books. [He holds up his handcuffed wrists.] Mother, may I? [He limps over to a shelf and pulls out a book. Castiel takes the book and opens it and removes a note.]

CASTIEL

“What is the maddest thing a man can do?” It’s a riddle? What – what’s the answer?

METATRON

Beats me. I’ve only been a man a day. Um, the – the answer to the riddle will lead to another book. And inside that book, you’ll find your Grace. We’re gonna work this out together, okay? Teamwork.

[Interior of the cabin.]

CHARLIE

Okay, even the Bletchley Circle couldn’t crack this thing. I’ve tried every cryptographic algorithm there is. Goose egg. [Dean is looking through the files.]

DEAN

Well maybe that’s not such a bad thing. Those people following you… Hmm? All kinds of wrong. Talking multi-generational, centuries old wrong. The Styne family. Men of Letters’ files have them dated back to the early 1800s. They used spells to create disease, to destabilize markets. Hell, they even helped the Nazis before they came into power, and they profited from all of it.

CHARLIE

So, they’re like the supernatural Du Ponts?

DEAN

Basically. All the spells they used came from a book of “unspeakable evil” which they lost nearly a hundred years ago.

SAM

Okay, so they’re bad. So what. We faced worse.

DEAN

Sam, read the file. The way the book works, is when you use it, there is a negative reaction. I’m talking biblical negative. Dark magic always comes with a price. We know that. We’ve been down that road before.

CHARLIE

Well, let’s at least translate it, see what it says.

DEAN

You guys don’t understand. The book’s been calling out to me ever since I laid eyes on it, okay? Calling out to the Mark. I can hear it like it’s alive. It wants me to use it, but not for good. Look, I wanted it to be the answer too, okay? I really did. But we have got to get rid of that. Burn it, bury it, I don’t give a damn. We’ll just have to find another way to fix the Mark.

SAM

Like what?

DEAN

I don’t know.

CHARLIE

So you’re giving up?

DEAN

No, I’m not giving up. Charlie, I don’t have a death wish. Okay, even if I did, I can’t die, not with this thing on my arm. What I can do is I can fight it as long as I can until….

SAM

Until what? Tell me. Until what, Dean? Until I watch you become a demon again? Until then? I can’t do that. I won’t do that.

DEAN

Well, then you’ll just have to lock me up. Bind me to the bunker like you did last time.

CHARLIE

That doesn’t solve anything.

SAM

Look, just let us translate the book, okay? If there’s a cure, we’ll do it and deal with the consequences later. I can’t lose you.

DEAN

Really?

SAM

Yeah, really.

DEAN

You change your mind on that, cause that’s not what you said last time.

SAM

Oh, come on, man. You know I didn’t mean that.

DEAN

This is my cross to bear, Sam! Mine! And that book is not the answer! Now we got to destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands, and that includes me! I’m gonna go for a drive. Uh, Charlie, we forgot to pick up your snacks.

SAM

Dean, look…

DEAN

We’ll figure out another way. And Sam, I’ll get my vacation. But not today. Not like this. [Dean leaves the cabin.]

CHARLIE

Sam, maybe he’s right.

SAM

No, there’s a way to fix it. There has to be.

[Interior of the library]

METATRON

You know, we really do make a good team. Kind of like a buddy comedy, without the comedy.

CASTIEL

Or the buddies.

METATRON

Oh now, come on. Back at the diner, that was some pretty awesome dynamic-duo action.

CASTIEL

What we did back there was unfortunate. No more of our brothers and sisters should die.

METATRON

Brothers and sisters? Listen to you. Still spitting out the company line like anyone cares. Like we’re actually a family? When what we really are – are a bunch of glowing lights filled with self-loathing or delusions of grandeur. Or both.

CASTIEL

You shut up!

METATRON

No! If I’m gonna die, I want answers. Like, who are you now? Like, you’re obviously not an angel of the Lord. And what about all of this walking the earth like Caine from “Kung Fu” crap? Cleaning up Heaven’s messes. How many more rogue angels are there out there? And, what are you gonna do once you’re done with all that? Go back to Heaven? Please. The angel formerly known as Hannah has restored order up top. Smoothest it’s run since God cut the ribbon on the pearly gates. So tell me, Castiel, truly, what is your mission now?

CASTIEL

You shut up and keep looking. [Castiel walks away.]

METATRON

Well…[Metatron touches books on the shelf with his finger and then gets blood on his finger from his wound. We then see that he’s drawn blood sigils on the books.] Cannot say I didn’t try. [He activates the sigils and walks toward Castiel in the next row. Castiel is coughing and collapses.] Poor Castiel. Swam so far just to drown in shallow waters. Isn’t it ironic? Don’t ya think?

[Interior of Cabin]

CHARLIE

What did Dean mean? When he said you changed your mind?

SAM

So, awhile back, we had a chance to, um…close the gates of Hell. And in order to do that, I would’ve had to die. And, I was okay with that, and I am okay with that, but Dean was not. And so, he uh…

CHARLIE

He saved you.

SAM

Yeah, he saved me.

CHARLIE

And let me guess, in doing so, he did something you didn’t want, and that pissed you off. And you said something that hurt him?

SAM

Yeah, that sounds about right.

CHARLIE

Brothers. You know, I haven’t been a hunter for very long, but it feels like this is the life. Mostly ends in Sophie’s choices, death, or tears. Usually, all of the above, huh? How did this become my life? I mean, I was gonna own my own start-up, marry ScarJo, invent something cool. Now I’m just….I’m just happy to be alive.

SAM

You know, when Dean came to get me at school, I-I told myself… one last job, you know? One more job. And then when – when I, um…. When I lost Jess, I, again, told myself one more job. There’s always one more job, you know? And one more job, and one more job, and then I was gonna go back to law and – and to my life.

CHARLIE

You were the Dread Pirate Roberts of hunting.

SAM

Yeah. I guess I really understand now that….this is my life. I love it. But I can’t do it without my brother. I don’t want to do it without my brother. And if he’s gone, then I don’t….

CHARLIE

I got it. I-I do.

ACT FOUR
[Interior of the library. Castiel is on the ground and Metatron is taking a book from the shelf.]

METATRON

All right…First things first – find what I really came here for. [He takes a note out of the book and reads it.] “What two things do you need to succeed in life?” Ignorance and confidence. [Castiel looks at the note from the first book.]

CASTIEL

They’re quotes.

METATRON

So, uh…did you and samateur hour really think I wouldn’t have a back-up plan? [Metatron locates a book and opens it to reveal a tablet. Castiel is crawling down another aisle looking for a book.] Ah. Hello Demon Tablet. [Castiel grabs at “Don Quixote” by Miguel Cervantes and knocks it off the shelf. The container with his Grace falls out of the book.] The places I’ll go with this. [METATRON limps to the row Castiel is in and sees Castiel has the container with his Grace.] And your Grace. Well, one out of two ain’t bad. [Metatron hurries away.]

CASTIEL

[Opens the container with his Grace.] What’s the maddest thing a man can do? Let himself die. [Castiel inhales his Grace. He stands up and has his full power back.]

[Interior of a “gas & sip.” Behind the counter, Jacob is standing next to the body of the clerk he killed. He’s wiping off his knife.]

JACOB

God just don’t build to last, does he?

[The door rings as Dean enters.]

JACOB

Afternoon, sir.

DEAN

Howdy. [Dean grabs some snacks and puts them on the counter.] There we go.

JACOB

That’ll be it for you?

DEAN

Uh, yeah, that’s it.

JACOB

Okay then, that’ll be $15.75. [Dean takes out a twenty and hands it to him. He sees Jacob’s tattoo on his wrist.] You heading home or you just passing through?

DEAN

Just passing through. [Jacob puts the money in the cash register. Dean looks at the store mirror and sees the dead clerk behind the counter next to Jacob.] Must get awful lonely out here all by yourself.

JACOB

Oh, I get by. [Dean pulls out his gun and points it at Jacob.]

DEAN

Don’t move. Hands where I can see them.

JACOB

Don’t you want your change? [He throws the change in Dean’s face and another man with him grabs Dean from behind.]

JACOB

[Jacob points his knife at Dean.] Now…who might you be? [He notices the Mark on Dean.] Well, hello there. Where’d a back-road nothing like you get their hands on something like that?

DEAN

What’s it to you, Mr. Styne?

JACOB

My friends call me Jacob.

DEAN

Well, I ain’t your friend.

JACOB

Those wouldn’t happen to be treats for a redheaded little gal, now, would they? Y’all hid the book, didn’t you? Lead-lined little number, I’m betting.

DEAN

I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.

JACOB

You don’t? See that? That man back there, well he said the same thing as all the others at truck stops and gas stations up and down the way. Nobody had seen that redheaded girl. And then a man bearing that Mark comes in here, to me. Well, there’s coincidence, and then there’s just providence. See, “The Book of the Damnded,” it wants to be found. It wants to come home. Let me guess. You want to use it to get that gift off your arm, don’t you? Power is wasted on the weak. Now the book….can remove that Mark. But you mess around with that, you’re gonna do far more harm than good. So, why don’t you do the right thing here, boy, and tell me where that book is.

DEAN

Yeah, sure, I’ll tell you. [Dean mumbles something.]

JACOB

One more time. I didn’t hear you. [He leans in closer to Dean.]

DEAN

I said…[Dean headbutts Jacob and knocks the man holding him off. He dives to the ground to grab his gun. He’s on the ground pointing the gun up at the man coming at him. He shoots as he pushes himself along the floor away from the man, but the man keeps coming. The man finally falls after Dean empties his clip into him. Dean reloads and stands up. Jacob is gone and Dean’s cell phone is broken.]

[Interior of the cabin – Charlie is stoking the fire as Dean comes in the door.]

CHARLIE

What’s going on?

DEAN

The Styne’s, they found me. [The Styne car races to the cabin.] Those douches are all jacked up, too.

SAM

What are you talking about?

DEAN

[He throws a cup of liquid into the fire.] I emptied a full clip into one of them before the son of a bitch went down.

SAM

Dean, what are you doing with the holy oil?

DEAN

[The Stynes are outside the cabin.] There is a cure for the Mark in the book. But it comes at a price. We got to destroy it.

SAM

Are you sure about this?

DEAN

It’s calling to me, Sam, okay? I can hear it. It’s calling to the Mark. It wants me to take the book and run away with it. Burn it now. [They hear the Styne’s outside. Dean and Charlie pull their guns.] Sam, burn it now.

[One Styne crashes through the window grabbing Dean while another crashes through the other window and grabs Charlie. Sam takes the lockbox with the book to the fireplace. Dean and Charlie are fighting off the Stynes as Sam takes the wrapped book out of the lockbox. Jacob breaks the front door of the cabin and enters. Dean shoots Jacob who keeps heading toward Sam at the fireplace. Sam throws the wrapped book in the fire.]

JACOB

You silly boy. [Dean keeps shooting Jacob. Jacob grabs Sam’s throat. Sam stabs him until Jacob finally collapses. The book is burning in the fireplace.]

[Interior of the Men of Letter’s Bunker. Castiel and Sam are sitting at the map table in the war room.]

ACT FIVE
CASTIEL

I was foolish, selfish. Should’ve just killed him. Who knows what he’ll do with that tablet.

SAM

Well, you know what, Cas? You got your Grace back. You’re back. You did the right thing.

CASTIEL

You did the right thing. That book needed to be destroyed. We will find another way, Sam. [The door opens and Charlie enters carrying two plastic bags. She heads down the stairs.

CHARLIE

We’re back, bitches! [She suddenly sees Castiel.] Whoa! Is that who I think it is?

SAM

Charlie, Cas. Cas, Charlie. [Charlie hugs Cas.]

CHARLIE

I thought you’d be shorter. [She puts the bags on the table. Sam grabs the bags.]

SAM

I’m gonna get these to the fridge.

CHARLIE

Heard you got your mojo back.

CASTIEL

Yes, my – my Grace, it’s – it’s been restored.

CHARLIE

So, can’t you just – you know… cure Dean?

CASTIEL

Unfortunately, it’s not that simple.

CHARLIE

Oh. Never is, is it? Do you think you could do anything about my carpal tunnel? [Castiel places two fingers on Charlie’s forehead.] Is that it?

CASTIEL

Your carpal tunnel and your bullet wound are now healed. You may want to continue wearing your wrist brace at night, though.

CHARLIE

Did we just become best friends? [Dean comes in the front door carrying pizza boxes.]

DEAN

Hey, look who decided to show. So? You’re back? 100%? How did that happen? [As Dean puts the food on the table, Sam enters the room.]

CASTIEL

Um, it was Hannah. She managed to get the location of the remainder of my Grace out of Metatron.

DEAN

Awesome. I told you we were due for a win. Good to have you back, pal.

[“Behind Blue Eyes” by The Who is playing. Dean is opening the beer bottles and they are sitting at the table eating pizza. Dean is laughing and Sam is trying to smile, but looks uncomfortable.]

SAM VOICEOVER

I don’t trust you and… I never will. But I need help [Cut to Sam sitting at a table in a restaurant.] and this is right in your wheelhouse. [He opens the lockbox and The Book of the Damned is in it.]

[Flashback to the cabin when the Styne’s were crashing through the windows.]

DEAN

Sam, burn it now! [While Dean and Charlie are fighting the Styne family members, Sam removes The Book of the Damned from the lockbox and unwraps it. Jacob Stein breaks through the door and Dean shoots him. Sam puts it back in the lockbox and grabs another book off the table. He wraps it in the cloth and throws that on the fire.

JACOB

You silly boy. [Dean continues to shoot Jacob, but Jacob reaches Sam at the fireplace and grabs his throat.

JACOB

My family will never stop looking for that book. [Sam looks at the other book burning in the fire.]

[Cut to interior of the restaurant. Sam is sitting at a table.]

SAM

I need the Mark of Cain off my brother. Something tells me you can crack this book and find that cure. The only question is…will you help me? [We see the person Sam is sitting across from is Rowena.]

ROWENA

Shall we discuss terms?
