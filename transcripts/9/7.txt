NOW (TEASER)
Two kids running, twilight or night; foggy; outside.

KID 1 (in red sweatshirt)
Aah! Wait up!

KID 2 (in plaid shirt)
Hurry! He's right behind us.

HURLEYVILLE, NEW YORK
KID 2
Come on, come on!
Hurry!

KID 1
Go, go, go – it's open!

The kids run into a barn.


KID WITH GLASSES (TIMMY)
Come on, guys. The barn is a no-fly zone during hide-and-go-seek.

A MAN's voice is overheard.
Boys? Come on, you delinquents. Time for bed!

MAN comes in to barn.

MAN
All right! Game is over, boys! Let's bring it in! (looking for kids) Lights out was 10 minutes ago!

The MAN shines his flashlight around, looking for the kids.

MAN (continues)
(muttering under his breath) You little bastards.
(Yelling loudly again:) Okay, I'm gonna...

The MAN gets spooked a little by a breeze and an eerie supernatural sound.

MAN (continues)
You got till the count of 10, and you'd better come out or the belt's coming off!
One ...
Come on!
The MAN's flashlight is flickering and dying. He hits it to try to get it to work again. The tractor/forklift suddenly starts to turn on. Its lights flip on.

MAN
Boys? (pause) Come on! This isn't funny.

The tractor/forklift starts moving toward the MAN. He backs up, away from the tractor, but falls and lands on his back.

The tractor is still coming on; the MAN scrambles backward. The tractor continues to head towards him.

The MAN gets to his feet and keeps backing up, until he's backed up against a wall. The forklift lifts as the tractor continues to advance towards him.

He screams, and the camera cuts to the exterior of the barn—where the forklift has pierced through the wall, and presumably impaled the man inside the barn.

Nobody else is in the room. SAM heads for some of the library bookshelves, and pulls a book off the shelves—The Marvelous Land of Oz by L. Frank Baum. (Other books on the shelf include Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim. He picks it up, looks at it speculatively and with a sort of sense of anticipation, sits down to read it, opening it up to the beginning.

I'm sorry, there's no, uh ˜ there's no Dee-dawg, uh...

DEAN grabs the phone.

DEAN
I got it, I got it. (DEAN takes the phone.) Sonny, hey. (pause) So what's up? (pause) Okay. (pause) All right. Yeah, just sit tight. I'll be there as soon as I can. (pause) Yeah.

DEAN hangs up.

SAM
So, what was that all about, 'Dee-dawg'?

DEAN (continues)
I knew you'd get hungry, so ... I tried taking the five-finger discount at the local market and got busted. I wasn't on a hunt. They sent me to a boys' home.

SAM
A boys' home, like a … reform school?

Written by
ADAM GLASS
DEAN
Yeah, more or less. It was a farm, and the guy who ran it – Sonny – he, uh, you know, he looked after me.

SAM
Wait. Does Sonny know what we do?

DEAN
Yeah. He's good people. I gave him the number to the Bat Phone, and sounds like he's got something in our wheelhouse.

Directed by
KEVIN PARKS
DEAN (continues)
So... Hey – you gonna be cool to do this, or are you too tired?

SAM
Uh, no. Yeah, I'm just, uh ... I'll be fine.

DEAN
And everybody's okay with … heading out to the Catskills? (DEAN emphasizes "everybody" like he's trying to reach through SAM's skull to talk to EZEKIEL.)

SAM (looking bemused)
I am everybody.

DEAN
Yeah. Right. All right. Grab your stuff, and we'll head out.

SAM
Hey, Dean ... I mean, why didn't you just tell me you went to a boys' home?

DEAN
I don't know. Uh, it was Dad's idea. And then it just – you know, the story became the story. I was 16.



SCENE - Driving in the Impala
Sign for SONNY'S HOME FOR BOYS. DEAN pulls up and parks between some farm fields and a house.

SAM
You were here for two months and Dad couldn't find you?

DEAN
Oh, no. He found me. He found me quick. But he left me here 'cause I lost our money.

Somebody is watching from an upstairs window.

SAM
You were 16. You made a mistake.

DEAN
Yeah. I made the mistake. (getting out of the car.) Look, I know how you think. None of this was Dad's fault.

The person watching from an upstairs window is a small boy with glasses, clutching an action figure doll.

DEAN and SAM go to the front door and knock. A middle-aged woman, with a sweater and a large cross on a necklace, answers the door. She folds her arms and looks at them.

DEAN
Hi.

RUTH
What can I do for you boys?

DEAN
I'm Dean. This is my brother, Sam. We're old buddies of Sonny's.

RUTH
Prison buddies?

DEAN swallows, taken aback; SAM coughs.

DEAN
No. Uh ... you mind telling him that we're here?

RUTH, after a pause
I'll go get him. (She turns around, then as they are about to follow her in, turns back to say: ) I just mopped this floor, so you take off those roach stompers.

SAM and DEAN look down at their boots and kick them off.

SAM (quietly, to DEAN)
Sonny's an ex-con, huh?

DEAN
What, and we're such angels? Trust me, he's more than made up for it.

They enter the house. DEAN looks at the couch in the living room, and has a memory ...



SCENE - FLASHBACK
A deputy sheriff, DEPUTY BILLY, wearing sunglasses, is talking to SONNY, a guy with large sideburns and a plaid shirt. They are in a living room with 16yo YOUNG DEAN sitting cuffed on a couch.

DEPUTY BILLY
Steven Hewlett caught him red-handed stealing up at his store.

SONNY
So what'd he take?

DEPUTY BILLY
Get this – peanut butter and bread.

SONNY looks at YOUNG DEAN assessingly, as he sits cuffed on the couch.

SONNY
Okay. And how about family?

DEPUTY BILLY
Well, his old man called. (YOUNG DEAN looks up.) Once he found out what happened, he said let him rot in jail. (YOUNG DEAN looks down at his knees.) Judge is off on a fishing trip. Boy's too young to leave in County. So we thought it best he stay here till arraignment.

SONNY
I don't see why not, man.

DEPUTY BILLY (taking off his sunglasses)
Appreciate it, Sonny.

SONNY (noting a black eye on DEPUTY BILLY)
Where'd you get the shiner?

YOUNG DEAN laughs.

DEPUTY BILLY to YOUNG DEAN
You think that's funny?

YOUNG DEAN
I think you're slow.

DEPUTY BILLY (angry, advancing towards YOUNG DEAN)
You sucker punched me!

YOUNG DEAN
You wish!

SONNY
Come on, now! (loudly, to get their attention)
(then, more calmly:) Billy, I got this, buddy. It's all right.

DEPUTY BILLY, calmer, leaves. YOUNG DEAN waves goodbye sarcastically.

SONNY
You shouldn't do that, kid.

YOUNG DEAN
Yeah? Why? Because he's a cop?

SONNY
Because when you make him mad, he leaves with the key.

YOUNG DEAN's face falls, he holds up his cuffs, and shakes his head disgustedly. SONNY watches, with a tiny small on his face. Then he leans forward to pick up a paperclip from an ashtray on the coffee table.

SONNY
Eh, don't sweat it.

Sitting in front of YOUNG DEAN, SONNY takes his cuffed hands to open up the cuffs. YOUNG DEAN's forearms are bruised and red, as if bruised or abraded by bindings or ligature marks.

SONNY (noting the marks with concern)
Deputy do that? (YOUNG DEAN scoffs and shakes his head.) What, your old man? (YOUNG DEAN shakes his head no.) Well, then, how'd you get it?

YOUNG DEAN (turning back to SONNY, somewhat defiantly)
Werewolf.

SONNY looks at YOUNG DEAN for a long moment, realizing he's not going to get a different answer from the kid.

SONNY
Okay.

SONNY turns back toward the cuffs, opening up them with the paperclip, and removing them. SONNY stands up and starts walking out of the room. Freed, YOUNG DEAN stands up too, shaking his hands.

DEAN
So, how do you know I won't just run away?

SONNY
Because you're hungry.

YOUNG DEAN
No, I'm not.

SONNY
Well, then, why'd you steal bread and peanut butter?

YOUNG DEAN shrugs.

YOUNG DEAN
So, what is this place, anyway?

SONNY
It's for boys like you. You work the land. Teaches you some discipline and responsibility. Keep you out of trouble.

YOUNG DEAN
(laughs)
That's lame.

SONNY
Beats jail. Come on. I'll fix you something to eat.



SCENE - PRESENT DAY
Back to present day. DEAN is smiling slightly. SONNY walks in. He's wearing glasses, has his hair pulled back in ponytail.

SONNY
Dee-dawg!

DEAN
Sonny! Good to see you.

SONNY
Hey, you, too, brother. (They hug. SAM stands by watching.) Oh, and this must be Sam.

SAM
Good to meet you.

SONNY
Back at you, brother.

DEAN
So, farm looks, uh, nice.

SONNY
Oh, please, man. It's barely standing. Only got a handful of kids working around here now.

DEAN
Why's that?

SONNY
Because these days, the system would rather incarcerate a boy than redeem him.

RUTH is wiping down a table nearby.

SAM
Hey, Sonny, uh, you – you mind if we talk alone?

SONNY turns to RUTH
Hey, Ruth, would you, uh, please go check on the boys, make sure their morning chores are getting done?

DEAN
All right. So, what's happening?

SONNY
Well, you remember Jack, don't you?

DEAN
Yeah. The, uh, tough, old leatherneck.

SONNY
Mm-hmm. Well, somehow, that ancient, rusty, broken-down tractor just roared to life and ran him over the other night.

SAM
Maybe – maybe it just, uh, slipped out of park or something.

SONNY
Couldn't have. (Shakes his head.) You know, I never – I never believed any of this mumbo-jumbo stuff you boys are into, but... something ain't right.

SAM
What do you mean?

SONNY
Well, just … things started happening – you know, lights flickering on and off, strange scratching sounds coming from inside the walls, windows and doors slamming.

DEAN
All right. You think you can round up the boys while we take a look around?

SONNY
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. Most are home on break – well, except those with no home worth going to.

DEAN
Mm.

SONNY walks out of the room.

DEAN (to SAM)
All right. Why don't you take the house? I'll check out the barn.

SAM
Yeah.


SCENE - upstairs
SAM walks into a bedroom. It's completely quiet. He notices a bed with some occult symbols notched on the bedpost. Pulls off several layers of taped name labels (KEVIN P. ... DARRYL ... another ... another ...) to reveal one that says DEAN W. He looks at it and marvels at seeing a piece of DEAN's past that he never knew about.

He hears a sound, draws a knife, and starts walking toward the open door of the adjoining room …

to reveal RUTH, on her knees, praying. She rises suddenly, alarmed.


SCENE
SAM
Hey. I am so sorry. I-I-I thought I ... saw something in, uh –

RUTH
Like a ghost? (She sounds more human and pleasant for the first time, and looks at the window.)

SAM looks at her, as if to say why would you think that? or how do you know that? RUTH looks down for a moment.

RUTH
Sonny told me you were old friends, but … I know why you're really here. That's why I was praying for us.

SAM
Praying for what?

RUTH (smiles slightly)
For the ghost that haunts this farm to leave.



SCENE - barn
DEAN opens and shuts the barn door. Pigeon sounds. He walks through the shadowy light and whips out his old EMF detector which makes a "wheee–oooo" chattering sound.

DEAN
All right, Casper... Where're you at?

DEAN puts the EMF back in his pocket. He hears a noise … a kid's voice … and walks toward it, opening another door to a dim room.

DEAN calls out
Hello? (He reaches out to still a swinging lightbulb.) Anybody here?

DEAN whirls around to a sound. It's the third kid, with glasses, seen earlier in the barn scene.

DEAN
Hey, kid, what are you doing in here by yourself?

Kid
Fighting monsters.

DEAN
What kind of monsters?

KID
All sorts, with Bruce the monster smasher. (The KID holds up his action figure doll.)

DEAN
Hm. Is that a cape? Little impractical for smashing monsters, huh? You know, you could choke—

The KID activates DOLL which says
I clobber evil!

DEAN
(chuckles slightly)
I bet you do.
(pauses)
I'm Dean.
(holds out his hand)

KID
Timmy. (shakes hand)

DEAN
Let's try that again. If you're gonna be a man, you got to learn how to shake like one, okay? So give me your best Kung Fu grip. Good. (They shake again.) Now look me straight in the eye. Let me know that you mean business. Shake as hard as you can. (Shake again.) That's it. You shake like that, you'll be all right. (TIMMY smiles.) Hey, Timmy, did you know Jack who worked here?

TIMMY nods
MM-hmmm (he says, very quietly)

DEAN
What can you tell me about him?

TIMMY
He yelled a lot. He was yelling when he had his accident.

DEAN
How do you know that?

TIMMY
'Cause me and the other boys were playing here when it happened.

DEAN
Did you see anything? (TIMMY shakes his head no.) Is there anything else about that night that you can remember, anything at all?

TIMMY
It suddenly … got really cold. (DEAN looks thoughtful.) Can I go? I have to finish my chores before Miss Ruth gets mad.

DEAN
That Ruth – she runs a tight ship, huh? Yeah, you better roll.



SCENE
RUTH (to SAM)
I grew up in this town. I used to come up here as a little girl. The Wasserlaufs, Howard and Doreen – they used to own this farm back then. (View from above, as if someone is watching them.) My co-worker, Jack, may he rest in peace, he worked here as a farmhand. Howard was a nice man, but... Well, he'd get into that corn liquor, and … one night he got it into his thick skull that Jack and his wife, Doreen, were rolling around in the hay. It wasn't true, but – but Howard's paranoia got the better of him. He tried to kill them both. Jack got away, but Doreen...

SAM
He killed her?

RUTH
With a meat cleaver. Got life in jail. Which for Howard ended a year ago. He always swore he'd get his revenge on poor old Jack, and ... looks like he finally got it.

SAM
Is Howard buried here in town?

She looks at him.


SCENE - digging up a grave, nighttime of course!
SAM
So … Dad didn't want you to tell me. How come? Was this place really so bad?

DEAN
I don't really remember. I mean, look, nobody bad touched me. Nobody burned me with their smokes, or beat me with a metal hanger. I call that a win.

SAM laughs a little.

DEAN hits something hard with his shovel.

DEAN:
Hey.

SAM and DEAN open up the coffin to reveal a corpse. They pour salt over it, liberally.

DEAN (sighs)
All right. Let's barbecue old MacDonald here, get the hell out of Dodge.

They toss a light, stand and watch.



SCENE - Impala, daytime
It's daytime, and the IMPALA is on the road – driving, we presume, away from SONNY's.


SCENE - Sonny's
♪ Ave Maria ♪ ♪ Ave Maria ♪

"Ave Maria" is playing on an old-fashioned radio. We see the outside of SONNY's, then inside, in a bathroom. RUTH's cross is draped on the sink. RUTH is relaxing in the bath listening to "Ave Maria". The lights start flickering but RUTH doesn't notice because she has a washcloth over her eyes. A frost forms on the mirror, and RUTH's breath suddenly is visible, indicating a sudden chill. The shower curtain slides on its rings, and then falls over RUTH's face.

RUTH is struggling and screaming, trying to peel the shower curtain off her face.

RUTH
Help! Help!

SONNY knocks on the bathroom door.

SONNY
Ruth, you okay? What's wrong?

Flashing between RUTH being murdered in the bath, and SONNY banging on the door to get in, and the volume on the radio going up. The close-up of RUTH's face through the shower curtain is really grotesque. Her hand rigidly grasps the side of the bathtub, then relaxes … with a splash into the bathtub.

SONNY
Open up!

SONNY
Ruth!

♪ Ave Maria ♪ ♪ Ave Maria ♪

ACT TWO
SCENE - Cus's Place
Daytime, exterior of restaurant "CUS'S PLACE: HOME STYLE MEALS"

DEAN and SAM are sitting at a table. DEAN, with a sly smile on his face, is watching the waitress who is at the counter, laughing with some other customers.

WAITRESS (to other customers)
That's okay.

SAM
Dean, you know I'm fine just grabbing a burger-to-go somewhere, right?

DEAN
What, and miss out on the best banana pancakes you ever had?

DEAN looks down at menu ….



SCENE - FLASHBACK
YOUNG DEAN is looking at the menu in a flashback, sitting with SONNY.

YOUNG DEAN
Thanks.

SONNY
No prob. I do this for all the boys after they've been here for a month.

YOUNG DEAN
I meant for getting the charges against me dropped.

SONNY
Well, being hungry's not a crime. It's the stealing that is. But I feel if you only do that once, you don't deserve a record. And seeing as how we can't find your pops anywhere, you can stay here as long as you want, Dean. You're doing good in school. You're making friends. You made the wrestling team. I'm proud of you. (pause) Let me ask you something, and I want you to be straight with me. Are you into the whole heavy-metal, devil-worshiping stuff?

YOUNG DEAN
What? No.

SONNY
Hey, I'm not – I'm not judging. It's just I found a few occult-looking symbols carved into your bedpost.

YOUNG DEAN
(sighs) It's a very long story.

SONNY
That story have anything to do with why you put the salt in front of your bunk door every night before bed?

YOUNG DEAN
Well, it's a family thing, so I can't really talk about it.

SONNY
Same family that left you here?

YOUNG DEAN is speechless.

SONNY (continues)
(laughs) What are you – what are you, in the mob or something?

YOUNG DEAN
More like something. (looks back down at his menu)

SONNY
I was part of this gang, right? They were my family. I lived, breathed, I would have even died for them. You know where it got me? 15 years in a correctional facility. And for what? Being loyal? To who? I should have been loyal to myself. Because you get one shot at this game, Dean, and when you look in the mirror, you want the guy looking back at you to be his own man.

YOUNG DEAN nods. Waitress with ROBIN name tag comes to their table.

YOUNG ROBIN
Hey, guys.

SONNY
Hey, Robin. How are you?

YOUNG ROBIN
I'm good. How are you?

SONNY
Good. Meet my new ranch foreman here, Dean.

YOUNG DEAN eyes her name tag, ROBIN.



SCENE - present day
DEAN is eyeing her name tag, ROBIN.

ROBIN
Hi. Welcome to Cus's. What can I get you two?

DEAN
Bet you never thought you'd see me here, huh? (He smiles insinuatingly.)

ROBIN looks at him with a blankly friendly expression.

ROBIN
Uh, look, I'm a little bit slammed right now. Do you guys want to hear the specials?

DEAN (looking hopeful)
Robin ... Dean Winchester.

ROBIN
Um ...

DEAN
I used to live up at Sonny's.

SAM is watching with interest.

ROBIN
Oh, oh. Uh, look, sorry. There's just – there's so many boys that pass through there, it's – it's hard to remember every – every name and face.

DEAN
Yeah. Uh, no. Sorry, I just – I remember you coming up there with your mom. She'd give guitar lessons. It's, uh – it was a long time ago.

ROBIN
Yeah. Mom – she loved helping out the boys. I guess that's why I kept giving lessons after she passed.

ROBIN clears her throat. There's an awkward silence.

ANOTHER WOMAN
Hey, Robin?

ROBIN
Um, would you excuse me? I'll be right back.

SAM
Dude …?

DEAN (suddenly getting up)
Let's go.



Seconds later they're outside walking to the IMPALA.

SAM
Wh – what was that?

DEAN
Nothing.

SAM
Nothing? Well, obviously it was something. Who was that waitress?

DEAN
I said it was nothing, all right? Drop it.

DEAN's phone is ringing; he picks it up.

DEAN
Sonny. (pause) What?!




SCENE - Sonny's
Outside. Door on the COUNTY CORONER's van slams shut. Police car is behind it. Police radio is chattering. Camera pans over to DEAN, SAM, and SONNY, watching.

SONNY
I tried to get in to save her, but the damn door wouldn't open.

SAM
Locked?

SONNY
There's no locks on the farm.

DEAN sighs.

DEAN (to SAM)
That means our little field trip to the cemetery was a bust. Sonny, is there anything else weird you can remember?

SONNY
What, 'cause we're not chest-deep in weird already, boys?

DEAN
I know, I know. I mean anything – really.

SONNY
There was one thing. Ruth always had her rosary beads with her, but now I can't find them anywhere.

SAM
All right. Um, let's start with the vics, okay? I mean, both lived in the house. They both, uh, worked closely with the boys.

DEAN
All right, why don't I go have a chat with the rug rats, see what's up? (Dean walks off)

SAM
Yeah. Sonny, you got any employee records on the victims?

SONNY
In my office. Let's do it.



SCENE - outside
DEAN walking around the house. He hears some kids talking.

KID 1
Come on, whatcha gonna do about it? You gonna cry?

KID 2
Timmy, you're such a little weirdo.

DEAN picks up his pace to intervene.

DEAN grabs KID 1, previously in the red sweatshirt kid and now in a camouflage pattern shirt; KID 2, previously in a plaid flannel shirt and now in a dark t-shirt, is pushing up against TIMMY against the side of the house.

DEAN
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
What are you doing? (DEAN grabs KID 2)
Come here. Huh?

KID 2
Nothing.

DEAN
Timmy, what's going on?

TIMMY is silent.

KID 1 huffs in annoyance.

DEAN turns around to face the other kids.

DEAN
All right, you two. Where were you this morning when Ruth had her accident?

KID 1
Unless you're a cop, we don't need to tell you anything.

DEAN
Oh, okay. Well ...

DEAN pulls an ID out of his pocket.

DEAN (continuing)
... How about that? (he shoves an FBI badge in each of their faces)

KID 1
We weren't even here this morning. Sonny sent us into town to get some chicken feed – we swear.

DEAN
What about Ruth? What can you tell me about her?

KID 2
Uh, we used to call her the warden. She was a real Bible-thumping hard-ass.

KID 1 nods.

DEAN
Obviously. What else? Anything different or weird you can think of?

KID 1
You mean besides Timmy?

Both kids laugh. TIMMY looks sad.

DEAN
Hey! (lower voice:) Either of you touch him ever again, I'm gonna go all Guantánamo on you. (KID 2 swallows.) Understand me? You get the hell out of here. Go on! Get.

DEAN gestures irritably and the kids scurry off. DEAN turns back toward TIMMY who is watching the bigger kids go.

TIMMY steps forward to pick up his doll/action figure. DEAN gives him a hand up.

DEAN
Hey. You and Bruce okay?

TIMMY
Yeah.

DEAN
Listen to me. Guys like that – they're cowards, okay? All you got to do is stand up to them one time and they'll stop, I promise.

TIMMY (looks down)
Okay.



SCENE - inside
SAM and SONNY are walking briskly through the house. SAM stops, seeing something.

SAM
Hey Sonny, wait. Um ... W-what is all this?

SONNY
It's our hall of fame. We had some pretty great athletes come through here, including your brother. (SAM exhales.) He was Sullivan county 135-pound wrestling champion. (SAM exhales again.)



SCENE - KID 2 is mowing and KID 1 is raking
They're being watched from above, from a window.

Horn honks. Car drives up. Boys turn to see ROBIN getting out of car, with a guitar case.

ROBIN
Hey, guys!

KID 2
She could give me a lesson anytime.

KID 1
Gross. She's like ancient.

KID 2 turns back to the lawnmower. It seems to pick up a rock, or something causing it to make a strange sound.

KID 2
What the hell?

KID 2 grabs the lever to turn it off. He tilts it on its side. We see that the underside has RUTH's cross caught up in the mechanism. KID 1 comes over to look.

KID 2
What's this doing in here?

KID 1 shrugs and shakes his head. KID 2 reaches his hand in cautiously and starts pulling out grass, and trying to pull off the cross necklace.

The view from the window above has ghostly noises. We see TIMMY standing in the window clutching his doll/action figure.

Below, KID 2 is still working with the lawnmower.

The camera pauses on the red power lever for a moment. KID 1 watches to see what happens. The camera pauses on the red power level – which flips. The engine turns over.

KID 2 screams; blood sprays out over KID 1, who tries to help his friend; KID 2 falls over; the lawnmower continues to run.

The camera pans over to TIMMY in the house. A hand clasps him on the shoulder – a hand with what appears to be strange markings, tattoos or scarring.

ACT THREE
SCENE
Open on someone reviewing a file about TIMMY. DEAN walks in.

DEAN
Kid's gonna need about 8,000 stitches, but he'll be fine.

SAM
That kid was bullying Timmy before the accident, right?

DEAN
Yeah. Why?

SAM
Check this out. (handing DEAN the file) Timmy was found in an abandoned building about a year ago all by himself. No one was sure how long he had been there.

DEAN
And what about his parents? (tosses file back to SAM)

SAM
Well, they posted a picture on the Internet, but no one ever showed up.

DEAN
Well, then, what's he doing here? Shouldn't he be in an orphanage?

SAM
He kept running away from Child Services. So about three months ago, Sonny offered to take him in.

DEAN
All right, so hard-ass counselors, bullies, all bite the dust, but Timmy's still standing. So, what are we talking? We got ourselves a Damien on our hands?

SAM
No. EMF rules out a demon. So ... probably ghost possession.

DEAN
Meaning what, we find Timmy and shove a fistful of salt down his throat, forced ejection?

DEAN sighs, points at SAM
You're taking the barn this time.

DEAN turns around and heads out. SAM sighs, taps the folder.



SCENE - barn
Chains rattling. SAM walks into the barn. Cows low. SAM opens the same door where DEAN found TIMMY. Pigeons coo. SAM looks up, sees the rafters, a trapdoor; goes up a ladder. Upstairs, he looks around; pulls out a flashlight. Sees a child's drawing on a wall. The drawing shows a happy family. Then shows a car driving, with "YMMOM" (MOMMY spelled backwards); then shows a car crash; flames; mom putting TIMMY outside the car.


SCENE - inside
DEAN is walking around, hears guitar; walks to room and sees ROBIN on the couch, playing guitar.


SCENE - FLASHBACK
YOUNG ROBIN is playing the guitar. YOUNG DEAN is sitting beside her. She plays a few chords and they laugh.

YOUNG ROBIN
So, you've been a lot of places?

YOUNG DEAN
Yeah. My, uh … My dad likes to move around a lot.

YOUNG ROBIN
What's your dad do?

YOUNG DEAN
(pauses)
Boring stuff.

YOUNG ROBIN
Do you like it?

YOUNG DEAN
shakes his head NO
No, not really. But my dad expects me to follow in his footsteps. So I've kind of gotten used to it.

He seems resigned.

YOUNG ROBIN
Yeah. I - I get it. My pops wants me to take over the diner? But that's not happening. So, what do you really want to do?

DEAN hesitates.

YOUNG ROBIN (continues)
I want to be a photographer and see the world, go to strange lands, eat crazy food.

YOUNG DEAN
(takes a breath)
I want to be a rock star, but... I also really like cars.

YOUNG ROBIN
Being a mechanic seems rough.

YOUNG DEAN
What? No, no. Not at all. Cars are freaking cool as hell. Fixing them is like … a puzzle, and the best part is when you're done, they leave, and you're not responsible for them anymore.

YOUNG ROBIN leans in to kiss him. He seems shocked.

YOUNG ROBIN
Have you kissed many girls?

YOUNG DEAN
What? (whew) Yeah. Of course. Lots.

YOUNG ROBIN
Really? (she grabs his collar) Well, I guess we'll just have to keep practicing.

She pulls him in for another kiss.



camera pulls out to show DEAN standing in the doorway, staring at the couch, reliving that moment; then


SCENE PRESENT-DAY
ROBIN looks up, sees DEAN.

ROBIN
Oh. Hey. Uh, what happened to you at the diner? I turned around to take your order, and you were just … gone.

DEAN
Long story. Um, have you seen Timmy?

ROBIN
No, not yet, but he should be here any minute for his guitar lesson.

DEAN
Yeah, we're gonna cancel that.

ROBIN
What?

DEAN
We got to get out of here, okay? I don't have time to explain. You just got to trust me.

ROBIN
T-trust you? (scoffs) (sighs) And why would I do that again?

DEAN
You do remember me!

ROBIN (softly)
How could I forget?

She laughs.

♪ Stone in love ♪


SCENE - PRESENT DAY
DEAN looks upset.

DEAN
There were – there were reasons why I had to leave. I don't have time to explain them to you right now. I got to get you out of here.

He comes over to the couch, grabs her by the hand, pulls her up and out of the room.

ROBIN
Hey! What are you doing?!

TIMMY
I'm sorry.

DEAN whirls around, with ROBIN, to see TIMMY.

DEAN
Sorry about what, Timmy?

TIMMY
I can't stop it.

A vase shatters against the door. ROBIN and DEAN flinch; he yells "ahhh!" and she screams.

DEAN
Go, go, go!

DEAN grabs her by the arm and pushes her to another room. Vases are flying in the air crashing against walls. DEAN grabs a fireplace poker. A lamp picks up and flies over their heads; they duck.

SAM is coming in through an open door that they're heading toward. They duck another lamp, SAM enters,

DEAN
Sam, go!

SAM whirls around but the door slams shut before he can get to it.

DEAN
Locked. Damn it!

ROBIN gasps. DEAN runs to kitchen cabinet and grabs a box of salt, tosses it to SAM.

DEAN
Circle.

SAM catches the box and starts to open it.

ROBIN
Dean, what – what just happened in there?

DEAN
Okay, listen to me. Whatever happens, you stay inside this circle. Understood?

SAM
All right. Dean (warningly) ...

DEAN whirls around to see TIMMY standing in the doorway with his action figure doll.

TIMMY
I can't control her.

DEAN
Can't control who?

SAM (stepping forward)
Your mom, right?

SAM puts down the salt and comes over to TIMMY.

SAM (continues)
Timmy, listen. We need you to tell us about the fire, okay?

Camera pans over Timmy's drawings, as he retells his story in voiceover:

TIMMY
It was late, and we were driving home when we crashed in the woods. Everything was on fire. But she saved me, pushed me out... (in the memory we can hear her cries) Before the car blew up... with her in it.

SAM
But that's not all, was it?

TIMMY
I ran through the woods. I found an empty building, where I hid. I was scared. It was dark and cold. So I cried. I cried for my mom. And then she came.

SAM
But she'd changed, right?

Flashback to TIMMY's final drawing, showing a large phoenix-like shape labeled MOMMY hovering over stick figure TIMMY.

DEAN
I'll bet she gave you that cool action figure, huh?

TIMMY
Yeah. When I turned 9.

SAM
Timmy…

A figure flickers in the kitchen near the refrigerator … it's a woman with blonde hair, horribly burned.

SAM (continues)
...I'm gonna need that action figure.

The spirit attacks SAM and throws him against the wall. DEAN swings the iron poker through the figure which dissipates. DEAN grabs the action figure doll from TIMMY, and puts it on the oven, turning the gas burner on.

TIMMY
No!

TIMMY watches in despair. SAM grabs TIMMY and puts him in the circle of salt with ROBIN, who holds him protectively. DEAN stands by the stove, watching the doll burn.

ACTION FIGURE DOLL'S VOICE
I clobber evil! … I clobber evil! … I clobber evil! … I … clobber … evil!

A wind blows in through the window, disrupting the circle of salt.

SAM
It looks like it wasn't the action figure that was anchoring her here, Dean.

DEAN
Then what is?!

SAM
Him.

ACT FOUR
SCENE - kitchen
ACTION FIGURE DOLL BRUCE is still burning on the range.

SAM steps out of the broken circle to go talk to DEAN.

SAM
You know what? I think maybe his mom can't let go and she's still protecting him from the grave.

DEAN
Protecting him from what? What, from us?

SAM
Maybe she doesn't know what threats are real and what's not, so she just attacks all of them.

DEAN
Great. So, what, unless we waste the kid, we're sitting ducks?

ROBIN
This is – this is crazy.

DEAN
Robin.

ROBIN steps out of the remnants of the circle, and runs out of the kitchen toward the front of the house.

DEAN
Robin! Damn it. (DEAN chases her) Robin, wait! (DEAN catches her)

ROBIN
Who are you?

DEAN
Right now I'm the only thing that's keeping you safe.

ROBIN, disbelieving, turns to leave – and turns into the ghost of MOM who has suddenly appeared. GHOST MOM makes a gesture and DEAN goes flying backwards into a wall. GHOST MOM clenches her fist, and DEAN clutches his heart in pain. ROBIN watches in terror.

From the other room SAM's voice is heard talking to TIMMY.

SAM
Timmy, we're gonna need your help, okay?

Hearing SAM and TIMMY, MOM looks towards the kitchen … and lets go of DEAN who gasps in relief. GHOST MOM shimmers out.

In the kitchen, SAM is kneeling in front of TIMMY.

SAM
Listen to me. I need you to focus, okay?

GHOST MOM reappears behind SAM.

SAM (continues)
Look, we are not here to hurt you.

GHOST MOM grabs SAM, pulls him backwards, throws him against the wall.

DEAN comes rushing in.

DEAN
Sammy!

GHOST MOM turns towards DEAN and throws him backwards too. She clenches her fist and DEAN groans. SAM looks at him.

TIMMY
I can't stop her.

DEAN
Timmy, you have to try!

GHOST MOM looks at DEAN balefully.

DEAN (continues, in a strained voice): She came to you when you cried out for her. Now you have to tell her to stop and go away!

TIMMY
She's my mom.

DEAN
She's a ghost. Timmy, because she can't move on, she's going crazy. Okay? You got to let her go. You'll be okay.

SAM gasps in pain.

DEAN (continues)
Listen to me. Sometimes you got to do what's best for you, even if it's gonna hurt the ones you love.

TIMMY adjusts his glasses, stands up, and says in a tremulous voice
Mommy... Stop it.

DEAN
Timmy, Kung Fu grip!

TIMMY (in a louder, stronger voice)
Mommy, stop it! Stop hurting people!

DEAN and SAM both gasp in relief as GHOST MOM lets them go. She turns to face TIMMY, and holds her arms out to him.

TIMMY (continues)
You have to go. Never come back. I'll be okay. I promise.

GHOST MOM's ghostly essence peels off, leaving GHOST MOM looking whole and human, smiling tearfully at her son as she holds her arms out to him.

TIMMY (continues)
I love you, too.

GHOST MOM fades completely away.

TIMMY runs to DEAN who embraces him. DEAN looks at SAM, who nods at him.

ROBIN comes into the room. DEAN holds TIMMY and pats on the back.


COMMERCIAL BREAK
ACT FIVE
SCENE
TIMMY is watching from the porch. It's nighttime.

ROBIN (to DEAN)
So, then, this is … the family business?

DEAN
Told you it was boring.

ROBIN
(laughs)
Yeah, right.

DEAN
Well, as you can see, I did not run off to become a rock star.

ROBIN
Mm... I don't know about that. You look pretty rockin' to me, Dean Winchester.

DEAN chuckles.

DEAN
And what about you?

ROBIN
I mean, I always thought that I would hate being in the same little town my whole life, and, you know, taking over the diner like Dad always wanted, but ... I don't. I just – I love it.

DEAN
I guess we didn't know everything we thought we did at 16, huh?

ROBIN
Not everything. Just some things.

ROBIN stands up to kiss him on the cheek. She walks to porch to be with TIMMY. DEAN waves to them both.


SONNY approaches DEAN.

SONNY
Sounds like Timmy's gonna need some help adjusting.

DEAN
Yeah, but he's got you.

SONNY
I always hate to see you go, Dee-dawg. (They clasp hands.) Can't thank you enough for this one, man. (they hug.)

DEAN
Sonny, we'll see you around.

SONNY
You can bet on that, boys. Take it easy, man.

SONNY and DEAN slap each other's shoulders one last time, and SONNY walks off. DEAN and SAM are alone together at the IMPALA.

SAM
Hey, h-how did you know Timmy asking his mom to leave was gonna work?

DEAN
I didn't. Total hail Mary. Got lucky.

SAM
You just got lucky?

DEAN nods.

SAM (continues)
Kind of like you did with this place. I mean, here I was thinking this was the worst part of your life, and it turns out it was the best. Why'd you ever leave?

DEAN
Never felt right.

SAM
Really?

DEAN
It was two months, Sam, okay? And I couldn't wait to get out of here. I don't know what to tell you. It wasn't me.

SAM accepts this, sort of, and gets in the car. DEAN pauses to look back at the house for one last memory.


SCENE - FLASHBACK
YOUNG DEAN is fastening a tie, wearing a short-sleeve button down shirt.

SONNY enters.

SONNY
Oh, look at you. You clean up good!

YOUNG DEAN
Thank you. You know, uh ... I've never actually been to one of these school dances before.

SONNY
Yeah. Look, about that, Dean, your old man's outside …. and, man, he's really something. I tried to tell him what a big night it was for you, Dean, and ask him if he could come back later, but he just said to tell you he had a job, said you'd know what that means.

YOUNG DEAN is nodding, looking emotional but trying to tough it out. He exhales, looks at picture of himself and YOUNG ROBIN, holding back tears. SONNY watches him.

SONNY (continues)
You know, after I got out of jail, this place gave me a second chance, and it's done the same for you, too.

YOUNG DEAN nods.

SONNY (continues)
So if you want, I'll stick my neck out for you, and I'll fight for you to stay.

YOUNG DEAN, still speechless, is choking back tears. JOHN's car horn honks outside. YOUNG DEAN goes to the window to look, and sees a very young-looking SAM holding a plane or spaceship out the window of the car. YOUNG DEAN laughs, choked-up, and turns back toward SONNY, holding out his hand. There's a tear trickling out his eye as they shake hands.

YOUNG DEAN
Sonny... ...thank you – for everything. But I have to go.

YOUNG DEAN and SONNY embrace.


SCENE - PRESENT DAY
DEAN gets into the IMPALA.

SAM
Dean ... Thank you.

DEAN
For what?

SAM
For always being there, for – having my back. Look, I know it always hasn't been easy …

DEAN
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

DEAN starts the car. SAM shuts his car door. They drive off into the night.
