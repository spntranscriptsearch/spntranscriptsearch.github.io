NOW
INT. CROWLEY'S LAB – NIGHT


The scene is exactly as we left it at the end of 7.01 Meet the New Boss. BOBBY is unconscious on the ground.


DEAN
Bobby?


BOBBY sits up.


DEAN [to LEVIATHAN-CASTIEL]
How many of you ass-clowns are in there? A hundred? More?


LEVIATHAN-CASTIEL is dripping black fluid.


DEAN
Your vessel's gonna explode, ain't it? Wouldn't do anything too strenuous. In fact, I'd call it a day, head on home, huh?


LEVIATHAN-CASTIEL
We’ll be back. For you.


BOBBY
Well, this is a new one.


SAM’s hallucination of LUCIFER (HALLUCIFER) is holding SAM against a wall with a hand around his neck.


SAM
You’re not real.


HALLUCIFER
Right. You think this fruit-bat fever dream is reality? You come back, I'm sorry, with no soul like some peppy American Psycho, till Saint Dean glues you back together again by buying you some magic amnesia. You’re real. I’m very real. Everything between is what we call set dressing.


SAM
No.


HALLUCIFER
You’re still in my cell. You’re my bunkmate, buddy. You’re my little bitch, in every sense of the term. Sam. Sam.


DEAN
Sam! You hearing me?


DEAN puts a hand against SAM’s chest.


DEAN
Whoa. Look at me. Hey. All right, we got to button this up. Come on, let’s get out of here. Come on.


EXT. RESERVOIR – DAY


LEVIATHAN-CASTIEL walks into a water reservoir. As DEAN, SAM and BOBBY watch, he goes under. A whirlpool appears and black liquid radiates out from it, then disappears.


BOBBY
Aw, hell.


A sign at the edge of the reservoir reads “Public Water Supply. No Swimming. No Fishing. No Boating.”


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. RESERVOIR – DAY


DEAN
Damn it.


BOBBY
You said it. Those... whatever you call 'ems...


SAM
Leviathan.


BOBBY
Right. If they’re in the pipes, they got themselves a highway to anywhere.


DEAN
Awesome.


DEAN picks up CASTIEL’s trenchcoat, which had floated to the edge of the reservoir.


DEAN
Okay. So he’s gone.


BOBBY
Yeah. Rest in peace. If that’s in the cards.


DEAN folds the trenchcoat and looks down at it sadly.


DEAN
Dumb son of a bitch.


BOBBY
Well, he was friends with us, wasn’t he? Can’t get much dumber than that. Come on, those things will be coming up for air soon.


MUSIC: “Black Water” by The Doobie Brothers.


VARIOUS SCENES: Teenage girls in bikini tops are washing cars, a woman fills a pitcher of water in her kitchen, and a young girl drinks from a fountain in a park. The water coming from the fountain turns black and the girl is possessed. A man fixing a car in his garage is hit by black liquid after investigating why the sink was rattling.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – DAY


SAM is asleep on a couch.


HALLUCIFER
Hey. Wake up, sunshine. Up and at 'em, atom man.


DEAN
Sammy.


DEAN touches SAM on the chest.


DEAN
Sammy, hey –


SAM jumps.


DEAN
Whoa. That’s twelve hours straight, I’m calling that rested. Here.


DEAN hands SAM a bottle of water and a power bar.


DEAN
Hydrate, and uh, protein-ate.


SAM
Breakfast in bed.


DEAN
Don’t get used to it. Let me see that hand.


HALLUCIFER
Oh, he wants to hold your widdle hand. How sweet.


DEAN removes SAM’s bandage and inspects his stitches.


DEAN
Eh, you’ll live. Here.


DEAN pours whiskey over SAM’s wound. SAM sucks in his breath with pain.


DEAN
All right, take it easy.


SAM
So, ooze invasion. Any leads?


BOBBY
I got all my feelers out. Whatever they’re up to, it ain’t – ain’t about going Mothra down Main Street. They’ll turn up. You seem pretty eager to stretch your legs, you know.


BOBBY puts a new bandage on SAM’s hand.


SAM
Mmm.


DEAN
Now onto our other big problem. How're you doin'? And do not say okay.


SAM
I’m not okay.


DEAN
You think?


BOBBY
Hey. Go a little easy.


DEAN
There’s nothing easy about it, Bobby, okay. We acted like he had everything under control.


SAM
I get it. I’m sorry. Look, I- I didn’t exactly want to crack up, you know?


DEAN
What the hell happened back there?


SAM
Well, it’s not just flashbacks any more.


DEAN
Well then what?


SAM
It’s more like... I’m seeing through the cracks.


DEAN
What does that mean?


SAM
It means I’m having a difficult time figuring out what’s real.


DEAN
Hallucinations.


SAM
For starters.


DEAN
Well for starters, if you’re tripping Hell’s Bells, why would you hide that?


SAM
I wasn’t hiding it, Dean, I – I was just not talking about it. I mean it seemed like you two had enough going on as it was. Look, I – I just figured, try to hold onto the safety bar and ride it out, you know? But it’s getting more specific.


DEAN
As in specifically what?


DEAN gets glasses of whiskey for himself and BOBBY.


DEAN
What the hell, Sam?


SAM
I told you.


DEAN
I mean seriously, how do you, how do you argue with that?


SAM
I know. It’s a problem.


DEAN
Well now wait, I got it. Why would the Devil holodeck you a whole new life when he could just kick your ass all over the Cage?


SAM
‘Cause, as he puts it...


SAM AND HALLUCIFER TOGETHER
You can’t torture someone who has nothing left for you to take away.


HALLUCIFER
Very good, Sam.


DEAN
Okay, fine. But this Malibu dream mansion that he, he, he makes for you to take away is this post-apocalyptic mess?


HALLUCIFER
It had to be a mess, Sam, or you wouldn’t believe it was your life.


DEAN
Wait. Are you seeing him right now?


SAM nods.


DEAN
You know that he’s not real. Right?


SAM
He says the same thing about you.


BOBBY
I’m going back to work.


TELEVISION SCREEN: “Breaking News: Surprise Eclipse”


TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Scientists have no explanation for what astronomers can only describe as a surprise eclipse.


INT. POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL’S BEDROOM


The POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL is watching TV and changing the channels.


TV (V.O.)
[Indistinct] [Different channel] Time to announce... [Different channel] We know you’re hungry. Why not indulge yourself at Biggerson’s home-made pie bar? It’s like a salad bar, but with pie. [Different channel] Next week on Dr Sexy MD, Dr Cheyenne Meganopolis makes a shocking return.


TV (DR MEGANOPOLIS V.O.)
I’m sorry, Doctor, I forgot being Head Surgeon means you cut into whatever body you want and take out whatever organ pleases you without any paperwork whatsoever.


The POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL smiles.


TV (DR SEXY V.O.)
Well Doctor, I’m sorry you’re so forgetful.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – DAY


SAM is taking apart his gun. BOBBY is using the computer in the kitchen. DEAN is leaning over BOBBY’s chair.


BOBBY
Well, at least he’s not curled up under the sink.


DEAN
Yeah, no, he’s just sitting there silently field-stripping his weapon.


DEAN takes SAM’s phone out of SAM’s jacket, which is hanging over a kitchen chair.


BOBBY
What are you doing?


DEAN
Turning on his GPS, case he decides to fly the cuckoo’s nest.


BOBBY
And you? How are you doing?


DEAN
Seriously Bobby, it ain’t like he’s hexed, you know? I mean, what if it’s the kind of crazy you can’t fix?


BOBBY
Yeah, I’m – I’m worried too, but humor me for a second. How are you?


DEAN
Who cares? Don’t you think our mailbox is a little full right now? I’m fine.


BOBBY
Right. And weren’t you pissed at him when he said the same thing just a couple hours before he spilled his marbles all over the floor?


DEAN
Yeah, well. [Pours himself a cup of coffee.] I’m not Sam, okay? I keep my marbles in a lead friggin' box. I’m fine. Really.


BOBBY
Of course. Yeah. You just lost one of the best friends you ever had, your brother’s in the bell jar, and Purgatory’s most wanted are surfing the sewer lines, but yeah, yeah, I get it. You’re – you're fine.


DEAN
Good.


BOBBY
Course, if at any time you want to decide that’s utter horse crap, well I’ll be where I always am. Right here.


DEAN
What, you want to do couples’ yoga, or you want to get back to hunting the big bads?

BOBBY
Shut up. Idjit.


EXT. STOCKVILLE HIGH SCHOOL – DAY


INT. STOCKVILLE HIGH SCHOOL MENS LOCKER ROOM – DAY


Three students enter the locker room.


STUDENT 1
Yeah? Up yours, Manny, I still got point-oh-six on your time.


STUDENT 1 (to two other students who were already in locker room)
Hey, where were you guys?


STUDENT 2
I guess we got here early. Heard something weird come from the showers.


STUDENT 3 closes and locks the door.


STUDENT 1
Hey, what are you doing, Williams? You’re going to get in trouble.


WILLIAMS
Yes, Scott, I probably am.


WILLIAMS grabs STUDENT 4 and throws him against the wall.


STUDENT 2 [crouching on top of the lockers]
What Williams is trying to say, Scott, is that we’re too hungry to care.


STUDENT 2 jumps down from the lockers and grabs MANNY. Blood splatters the lockers.


ACT TWO
INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – DAY


Two women are sharing a hospital room. One is Sheriff JODY MILLS from 5.15 Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid and 6.04 Weekend at Bobby's.


PATIENT 1
...crying to the ER nurse, screaming Mother Mary mercy, and when they opened her back up, three sponges and a set of clamps, sewn up inside like she was a living piñata. You can’t trust these people.


DR GAINES
Afternoon, ladies.


PATIENT 1
Oh hello, Doctor!


JODY MILLS
Hi, Dr Gaines.


DR GAINES
So, Ms Mills. You did excellent today. Just as we discussed, it was a textbook appendectomy.


JODY MILLS
That’s good.


DR GAINES
But you have been through a serious surgical procedure, and you know, I know you’re tough, but I want you to take it easy tonight.


JODY MILLS
Works for me, Doc.


DR GAINES
The good news: I’ve put you down for some pretty fun painkillers.


JODY MILLS
Ooh.


DR GAINES
I’ll check in on you first thing. You’ll be home in no time.


PATIENT 1
Charming, isn’t he? Did you know a study showed three quarters of doctors cheat on their exams? He might not know your appendix from your vagina.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – DAY


DEAN enters carrying groceries.


BOBBY
Hey there Gunga Din, buck up.


SAM
So it looks like we got some bad news for a change. Stockville North Kansas, most of a high school swim team got mangled to death in their locker room.


BOBBY
Cop talk on the wire’s kind of garbled, saying it looks like some kind of wild animal attack. They’re saying that whatever attacked them’s about the size of a linebacker.


SAM
It’s a lead, Dean.


DEAN
All right, but if you think you’re going out on a hunt...


SAM
No, I know. I’m not. But you are. Look, Bobby’s running the hub, I’m – I’m 5150’d, which leaves you to follow this thing up.


DEAN
Sam, you’re in the middle of a psychotic break.


SAM
It’s a couple hours’ drive, Dean, and it could be a Leviathan thing.


DEAN
Nah, if you think I’m leaving you here alone...


BOBBY
Hey. What am I, chopped brains on toast? I can eyeball the kid. Go. Work off some of these nerves on something useful.


DEAN looks at SAM and BOBBY and shrugs.


DEAN
Fine.


EXT. PLAYGROUND – DAY


The POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL is on a swing. A MAN approaches and takes hold of the swing.


MAN
You got yourself an awfully small body.


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
Too small. She didn’t know anything. Can’t even see over the counter.


MAN
Well this one, Edgar, Edgar worked on something called a demolitions crew. Watching things blow up is apparently very satisfying.


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
Annie? Knew where babies come from. Disgusting, by the way. I’m hungry. We all are.


POSSESSED MAN (EDGAR)
Yes, about that.


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
I’m sorry!


EDGAR
Sorry? They ate the swim team.


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
Like I said, hungry.


EDGAR
That’s no excuse.


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
Well what do you want me to do?


EDGAR
Get them in line. I don’t care how. For God’s sake, it made the papers. Look, the boss, honestly, he just wants to hear it’s taken care of, so take care of it. Quickly. I don’t like bringing him bad news. Are we clear?


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
Actually, I have an idea. I could use your help.


INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – DAY


DR GAINES is walking down the hallway. The POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL is humming behind a privacy screen in an exam room.


DR GAINES
Little girl, can I help you?


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
Are you a Dr Sexy?


DR GAINES
Uh, I’m a surgeon. Where are your parents?


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL shakes her head.


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
Is it true? Surgeons can just cut into whatever body they want?


DR GAINES
What?


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
And remove whichever organs they please?


DR GAINES
Where in the world did you hear s—


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
I want to be a surgeon when I grow up!


The POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL grabs DR GAINES’ arm, hard.


DR GAINES
Ow! Let me go!


Bones crack.


DR GAINES
Aargh!


DR GAINES falls to his knees.


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL
And I want to grow up now!


POSSESSED LITTLE GIRL takes on the form of DR GAINES. Blood appears on the privacy screen.


INT. STOCKVILLE HIGH SCHOOL MENS LOCKER ROOM – DAY


A FORENSICS OFFICER is examining the blood-splattered wall of the locker room.


DEAN
Special Agent Anderson. Ian.


OFFICER
Yeah, okay. Our point cop’s out on the donut. Forensics [indicates himself]. I can show you the layout. And step lightly. We got a whole bunch of NC17 shiznickel right over there.


DEAN
Right.


DEAN sees black ooze on a wall.


DEAN
Dammit.


EXT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – NIGHT


INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – NIGHT


JODY MILLS is asleep in her hospital bed. She wakes and sees DR GAINES putting a breathing mask on PATIENT 1 in the other bed.


DR GAINES
Just breathe deeply.


PATIENT 1
But my surgery isn’t till tomorrow.


DR GAINES
Just breathe deeply. I’m Dr Sexy. Your surgery is when I say it is.


JODY MILLS see DR GAINES wheel PATIENT 1’s bed out of the room, but pretends to be asleep.


JODY MILLS
Huh. Not weird at all.


JODY MILLS gets up to follow and watches DR GAINES wheel PATIENT 1’s bed down the hallway.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM’s phone rings. He sees HALLUCIFER reading a newspaper at the table.


SAM (on phone)
Yeah.


DEAN (on phone, driving)
Well, we are positive for ick. Same kind of stuff that came out of Cas, and, uh, two of the swim kids were missing – they stole one of their parents’ cars.


The scene alternates between SAM in BOBBY’s house and DEAN in the IMPALA.


HALLUCIFER
You know, I really think Price William has found the right girl. What do you think?


SAM (on phone)
So you think these, um, these Leviathan things just jump into people? Like Eve did?


DEAN (on phone)
I don’t know, it makes sense, right? Anyway, uh, state trooper’s got surveillance cam on the kids about six hours old, of them gassing up just south of Dakota line, so I’m headed back your way. We’ll just track them from Bobby’s.


SAM (on phone)
Yeah, sounds good.


DEAN (on phone)
Hey! How are you doing?


SAM turns to look at HALLUCIFER.


SAM (on phone)
You know, uh, okay.


DEAN (on phone)
Okay. Well hang in there, all right?


DEAN and SAM hang up.


HALLUCIFER
Just okay? Man, I’m having a great day.


INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – NIGHT


JODY MILLS is following DR GAINES, who is pushing the unconscious PATIENT 1 on a hospital bed. He enters the Organ Transplant Unit, outside which is a sign saying “Ward Closed for Renovations”. JODY MILLS sees DR GAINES cut into PATIENT 1, remove her liver and eat it. She gasps and heads back down the hallway.


NURSE
Ms Mills, what are you doing out of bed? Are you okay?


JODY MILLS collapses.


ACT THREE
INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – NIGHT


JODY MILLS awakens back in her hospital bed.


NURSE
Ms Mills, you gave us all a scare.


JODY MILLS
What? No, uh...


NURSE
You can’t be wandering around the halls like that in your condition.


JODY MILLS
He t—, he took...


JODY MILLS looks at the other bed in the room, which is empty.


NURSE
What? Who?


JODY MILLS
Dr Gaines?


DR GAINES
Ms Mills. We told you to take it easy, remember?


JODY MILLS
Of course. I –


DR GAINES
What in the world were you doing, wandering the halls like that?


JODY MILLS
Nothing. Um, my stitches were itching and I just wanted to know if that was normal, and I must have fainted or something. My stitches feel fine now.


DR GAINES
Ms Mills, you can’t get out of bed. You could have ripped open your sutures with a fall like that. Don’t make me go back in there. Okay?


The NURSE injects something into JODY MILLS’ drip.


JODY MILLS
What’s that?


NURSE
Just something to help you sleep.


JODY MILLS
No, that’s okay, I’ll sleep just fine.


DR GAINES
Doctor’s orders. I’ll check on you later.


DR GAINES and the NURSE leave the room. JODY MILLS removes her drip, gets out of bed and takes her handbag from a drawer.


JODY MILLS
You can kiss my ass, Doctor Monster-Face.


JODY MILLS sags against the side of the bed.


JODY MILLS
Oh no.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT


HALLUCIFER is swinging a fire poker like a golf club.


SAM
Okay, if this is some dream and you got power over it, why don’t you just end it?


HALLUCIFER
End it? This? You not knowing what’s real, the paint slowly peeling off your walls, come on, man, this is the sweet spot! Why would I end it? Not like we got HBO in the Pit. All I got is you, floating over the coals with half a hope that you’re gonna figure it all out. There’s only one way to figure it out, Sam. It’s up to you. It ends when you can’t take it anymore.


SAM shakes his head. HALLUCIFER looks at SAM’s guns on the table.


HALLUCIFER
I think that’s maybe why we’re cleaning our guns.


SAM
Shut up. I said [shouting] shut up!


BOBBY
Hey, Sam. You, uh, having a little bag lady moment?


SAM
Sorry.


BOBBY gets beers out of the refrigerator and hands one to SAM.


SAM
Thanks.


They each take a drink.


SAM
You know, after... everything. All these years, all that we’ve been through...


BOBBY
You beat the Devil before, kid.


SAM
It’s kinda different.


BOBBY
Not really. You’ll get a handle on this too. You will.


SAM sees HALLUCIFER standing behind BOBBY, holding the fire poker.


BOBBY
You’re not in Hell anymore. You’re here, with us.


SAM sees HALLUCIFER stab BOBBY with the poker.


BOBBY
You hear me, Sam?


SAM nods.


SAM
Yeah, I hear you, Bobby.


Bobby’s phone rings.


BOBBY
Oh. That’s my local. [Answers phone.] Hello?


JODY MILLS (on phone, sitting on the floor of her hospital room)
Bobby Singer? My surgeon is a monster.


The scene alternates between BOBBY’s house and the hospital.


BOBBY (on phone)
Come again?


JODY MILLS (on phone)
He took my windbag roomie and he ate her liver. Except he wasn’t, he was no surgeon... Listen. His face, his mouth was this horrible –


BOBBY (on phone)
Who is this?


JODY MILLS (on phone)
It’s Jody. Jody Mills.


BOBBY (on phone)
Jody?


JODY MILLS (on phone)
Sheriff Mills.


BOBBY (on phone)
Gotcha.


JODY MILLS (on phone)
I can’t exactly call a deputy here. You and I killed zombies that one time – I know you handle this kind of thing. Please get your ass here to Sioux Falls General before he eats me, Singer.


JODY MILLS and BOBBY hang up.


BOBBY
Well, either Sheriff Mills is having an ObamaCare-insured opium dream, or something’s eating folks down at Sioux Falls General Hospital.


BOBBY gets his jacket.


BOBBY
Look, I don’t want to bruise your ego or anything, but...


SAM
No, no, no, it’s okay. Go, go, go. I’ll – I’ll watch the phones.


HALLUCIFER
So, just you and me, huh?


INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – NIGHT


Two members of the high school swim team, with bruises and cuts on their faces, are standing at the admittance counter.


NURSE
What happened to you two?


EDGAR
I did. Where’s Dr Gaines?


NURSE
Oh no, that’s not how it works, okay? If you require a physician’s attention, you’re going to have to fill out these forms.


DR GAINES
I can take over from here, nurse. These youths obviously require immediate care.


DR GAINES leads the boys and EDGAR down the hallway.


DR GAINES
This is where they bring their bodies to be fixed. They consider it a safe place. But the truth is, often they actually die here instead. And they never question it! I’m not kidding.


They enter a room in which a woman and a man are tied up.


DR GAINES
We can feed discreetly. Who will know? A few of us in the right positions, and we can feast every single day. I’m thinking head nurse and the staff administrator first.


EDGAR
I have to hand it to you. That’s exactly what the boss asked for.


DR GAINES
Out of the box thinking.


EDGAR
Yes. You’re off the swim team, boys. Time to pursue a career in medicine.


The boys approach the nurse and administrator.


EDGAR [to DR GAINES]
All right. Check in.


DR GAINES
You won’t stay? I would love to grab us a good anesthesiologist.


EDGAR
He asked me to check into some other business in the area.


DR GAINES nods.


EDGAR
Anyway, it seems you’ve got things well in hand.


The boys grab the arms of the nurse and administrator.


EDGAR
Why can’t they scream?


DR GAINES
Oh, I severed their vocal cords, of course. It was a delicate procedure, but very doable.


Blood splatters the wall.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM is assembling his gun again and using a stopwatch to time himself. He looks displeased with the time. He hears a car pull up and walks towards the door with an open can in his hand. DEAN enters.


SAM
Dean.


DEAN
Hey. Oh, yeah. Good thinking.


DEAN takes the can from SAM.


SAM
Uh...


DEAN takes a drink from the can.


DEAN
So I, uh, I followed those swim kid Levia-whatever...


SAM
To where?


DEAN
Here. Well, back to town, and that ain’t the good news.


SAM
What?


DEAN
It ain’t just two of them, I don’t think.


SAM
Did you call Bobby?


DEAN
Yeah, he’s working his own case, I gotta move and I need back-up and that means you.


SAM
Wait. You sure about that?


DEAN
I know, you’re bonkers. But, luckily I just need you to keep the engine running and wait by the back door. Just don’t, uh, don’t let Satan change my presets. Let’s go.


DEAN walks out the door. SAM gets his gun and jacket and follows him.


EXT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL – NIGHT


BOBBY is pushing JODY MILLS in a wheelchair.


JODY MILLS
Her name’s Mrs Hackett. She never came back.


BOBBY
I’ll check it out. Now you get some rest. I’ll come by later.


JODY MILLS
Bobby Singer. My hero.


BOBBY
That’s the roofies talking.


BOBBY helps JODY MILLS into a taxi.

A card on a locker reads:

NAME: Mrs Madeline Hackett
T.O.D.: Oct/03 9:44AM AGE: 56

BOBBY opens the locker, pulls out the body and reads the chart on top of it.


BOBBY
Foot surgery, huh. Died this morning.


BOBBY pulls back the sheet covering the body.


BOBBY
Already autopsied, what the hell?


INT. IMPALA – NIGHT


DEAN
How you doing, Sam? In the head region. Devil still riding shotgun?


SAM
Not right now, but... yeah.


DEAN
Maybe we ought to get you, I don’t know...


SAM
Some – some what? Some... professional help? What are they gonna do, Dean, just stuff me full of pills. We’ll figure out some other option.


DEAN
Okay, yeah. But what are your other options? You remember when Martin took his nose-dive and started shooting at nothing? I mean his sweater unraveled fast.


SAM
I’m not Martin.


DEAN
No, but you are crazy. That don’t wash off. You get that, right? You are never going to be okay, Sam.


EXT. BOBBY'S SALVAGE YARD – NIGHT


The IMPALA, containing only DEAN, pulls up at BOBBY’s.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN enters and walks through the house looking for SAM.


DEAN
Sam? Sammy? Sam? Oh, crap.


EXT. OFFICE BUILDING – NIGHT


The IMPALA, containing HALLUCINATION-DEAN and SAM, pulls up outside what appears to be an office building. Five people are visible through glass windows. HALLUCINATION-DEAN and SAM get out.


HALLUCINATION-DEAN
Oh, dammit. There’s five of ’em. All right, come on.


SAM
Are you sure?


HALLUCINATION-DEAN
Yeah, and listen, when we get in there, you gotta keep it together.


SAM is holding keys.


SAM
Yeah, yeah, I – I will, I –


HALLUCINATION-DEAN
’Cause if you’re seeing Lucifer, then you could be seeing all kinds of crap, okay? You just don’t know.


SAM
How is this helping?


HALLUCINATION-DEAN
I’m just saying, Sam, you’re out of control.


SAM
I’m dealing with it the best I can.


HALLUCINATION-DEAN
Dealing? [Laughs] Sorry, that’s just funny, I mean how can you deal? You think this is an office building, right?


HALLUCINATION-DEAN holds the door open for SAM and they enter the building. The door reads “Morning Star Endeavors Ltd”.


INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT


HALLUCINATION-DEAN
Sorry. Wrong.


SAM
Where the hell are we?


HALLUCINATION-DEAN
Oh, you think I’m Dean! Right.


HALLUCINATION-DEAN smiles and morphs into HALLUCIFER.


HALLUCIFER
You poor clueless son of a bitch.


SAM
Stay the hell away from me.


SAM turns and walks away.


HALLUCIFER
Your world is whatever I want it to be, understand?


SAM turns and shoots at nothing.


SAM
Leave me alone!


HALLUCIFER appears behind SAM.


HALLUCIFER
Now we’re getting there. Pinocchio’s seeing his strings.


SAM
Shut up.


HALLUCIFER
It’s the big crescendo.


SAM
I said shut up!


SAM fires his gun. HALLUCIFER appears behind him again.


HALLUCIFER
Want to point that gun at someone useful? Try your face.


HALLUCIFER walks closer to SAM.


HALLUCIFER
Want to know the truth? Want to skip to the last page of the book? You know where to aim.


HALLUCIFER holds a finger against the underside of his jaw.


HALLUCIFER
Cowboy. [Makes a sound to imply pulling the trigger.]


INT. SIOUX FALLS GENERAL HOSPITAL MORGUE – NIGHT


BOBBY is examining Mrs Hackett’s insides.


BOBBY
It’s like a friggin’ doggy bag in here!


DR GAINES enters.


DR GAINES
Can I help you?


BOBBY
You can maybe still help this hospital!


BOBBY takes out some ID and holds it up briefly.


BOBBY
Who’s responsible for this sloppy bit of documentation?


DR GAINES
I know you.


BOBBY
No, you got the wrong guy.


DR GAINES
Bobby... Singer. Yes. We saw you. Through the angel’s eyes.


BOBBY grabs a mallet off a tray and hits DR GAINES across the face.


BOBBY
Well, let’s try for amnesia, then.


BOBBY takes a shotgun out of his bag as DR GAINES’ face transforms. He now has a huge mouth, long pointed teeth and a two-pronged tongue. BOBBY shoots. DR GAINES’ face returns to normal and he drips black ooze.


BOBBY
Fair enough.


BOBBY runs out of the room.


INT. IMPALA – NIGHT


We see a shot of the GPS on DEAN’s phone.


DEAN
Oh, this can’t be good.


EXT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN pulls up near a black van and gets out of the car.

SAM and HALLUCIFER are standing close together. DEAN enters.


DEAN
Sam? Sam!


HALLUCINATION-DEAN
Oh look. Another me.


DEAN
Sam, what are you doing?


SAM points his gun at DEAN. DEAN holds up his hands.


DEAN
Whoa, whoa!


SAM
I was with you, Dean!


DEAN
Okay. Well, here I am.


SAM
No. No, I don’t, I...


SAM looks at HALLUCIFER, then back at DEAN.


SAM
I can’t know that for sure. You understand me?


DEAN
Okay, now we’re gonna have to start small.


SAM
I don’t remember driving here.


HALLUCIFER
Well that’s because I drove. You thought. [to DEAN] Sam is very suggestible.


SAM shoots at what he thinks is HALLUCIFER.


DEAN
Whoa, whoa! Sam! This discussion does not require a weapons discharge!


SAM is breathing heavily. He lowers his weapon.


DEAN
Look at me. Come on. You don’t know what’s real? Look man, I’ve been to Hell. Okay, I know a thing or two about torture. Enough to know that it feels different. Than the pain of this – this regular, stupid, crappy this.


SAM
No, no. How can you know that for sure?


DEAN
Let me see your hand.


DEAN reaches out his hand. SAM lifts his right hand.


DEAN
No, no. The – the gimp hand! Let me see it.


HALLUCIFER
Smell you, Florence Nightingale.


SAM looks around at HALLUCIFER. DEAN grabs SAM’s bandaged left hand.


DEAN
Hey.


DEAN shakes SAM’s hand.


DEAN
This is real. Not a year ago, not in Hell, now. I was with you when you cut it, I sewed it up! Look!


DEAN squeezes SAM’s bandaged left hand and grabs the barrel of the gun SAM is holding with his other hand. HALLUCIFER appears next to DEAN and flickers.


HALLUCIFER
We’ve done a lot more with pain.


SAM takes an indrawn breath and winces.


DEAN
This is different. Right? Then the crap that’s tearing at your walnut? I’m different. Right?


SAM takes his hands away. DEAN keeps SAM's gun.


SAM
Yeah, I think so.


HALLUCIFER
You sure about that, bunk buddy?


SAM is looking at HALLUCIFER, next to DEAN.


DEAN
Sam? Sam.


SAM pushes his right thumb against his wound, which bleeds through the bandage. HALLUCIFER flickers again.


HALLUCIFER
Doesn’t mean anything.


DEAN
Hey. I am your flesh-and-blood brother, okay? I’m the only one who can legitimately kick your ass in real time. You got away. We got you out, Sammy.


HALLUCIFER
Sammy. Sammy.


SAM continues to push his thumb hard against his wound.


HALLUCIFER
Sammy, I’m the only one who can...


HALLUCIFER flickers and disappears.


DEAN
Believe in that! Believe me, okay? You gotta believe me. You gotta make it stone number one and build on it. You understand?


SAM nods.


SAM
Yeah. Yeah, okay.


SAM nods again. His phone rings.


SAM (on phone)
Bobby, hey.


BOBBY (driving, on phone)
The Sheriff was right. The hospital thing’s definitely our kind of thing. I double-barreled one of them in the morgue. Silver buckshot – no effect. Bled black ooze.


The scene alternates between SAM in the warehouse and BOBBY driving.


SAM (on phone)
Leviathan here?


BOBBY (on phone)
I’m falling back. I’ll meet you at the house. We can regroup.


SAM hangs up.


SAM
Bobby’s got a live one.


DEAN
Okay, well let’s go.


SAM nods. DEAN exits and SAM follows him.


INT. IMPALA – NIGHT


DEAN
Look, when we get back to Bobby’s –


SAM
It’s okay, Dean, I’m good. No white rabbits. [laughs briefly] I’m not seeing anything.


DEAN
Okay. Baby steps.


DEAN gives SAM a small smile and SAM gives him one in return.


DEAN
Oh no.


There has been a fire at BOBBY’s house.


EXT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN get out of the car and stand looking at the house.


DEAN
Oh no.


ACT FOUR
EXT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN walks out of the remains of the house. SAM jogs up to him.


SAM
Any sign of him?


DEAN holds up a blackened journal and tosses it behind him. They walk through a workshop.


DEAN
That place was torched. Somebody knew what they were doing.


SAM
You think Bobby was back there?


DEAN
I don’t know.


DEAN holds up a hand to indicate that SAM search for BOBBY to their right.


SAM
Bobby!


DEAN takes out his phone and makes a call.


BOBBY’S PHONE MESSAGE
This is Bobby Singer’s direct hotline. You should not have this number. [beep]


DEAN (on phone)
You cannot be in that crater back there. I can’t... If you’re gone, I swear, I am going to strap my Beautiful Mind brother into the car and I’m gonna drive us off the pier. You asked me how I was doing? Well, not good! Now you said you’d be here. Where are you?


DEAN hangs up.


SAM (V.O.)
Bobby!


DEAN
Bobby!


SAM is walking through junkyard cars.


SAM
Bobby? Bobby!


SAM turns a corner and sees EDGAR.


EDGAR
Winchester. Congratulations. Apparently you two are competent enough to warrant annihilating. I’d take it as a compliment.


DEAN shoots EDGAR in the side of the head with a shotgun. EDGAR straightens up, looks at the black ooze on his hand, and his face transforms: his mouth enlarges, his teeth become long and jagged, and a long, two-pronged tongue unfurls. With his face returned to normal, EDGAR knocks away DEAN's gun, then grabs DEAN and throws him against a car. The camera focuses on DEAN's right leg, which is apparently injured. SAM runs up and punches EDGAR in the face.


SAM
Dean, now!


DEAN is on the ground, but operates the controls for a hoist that’s holding a car suspended in the air. EDGAR smashes SAM in the head with a metal bar, seconds before the car drops onto EDGAR. SAM falls backwards onto the ground. Black ooze spreads from under the car around EDGAR’s hand, which is the only part of him visible. DEAN pulls himself over to SAM.


DEAN
Sam.


DEAN grabs hold of SAM’s shirt and shakes it a little.


DEAN
Sammy? Hey, come on now. Come on, I’m the one with the broken leg, you got to carry me. Sam!


DEAN holds his hand flat against SAM’s chest. SAM is unconscious.


DEAN takes out his phone and makes a call.


ACT FIVE
EXT. STREET – NIGHT


An ambulance drives down the street, lights flashing and sirens blaring.


INT. AMBULANCE – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN are on stretchers inside. A paramedic is examining SAM.


DEAN
Sam, stay with me, you hear?


PARAMEDIC (into communicator)
Male, late twenties, head trauma. Signs of increasing intracranial pressure.


SAM opens his eyes and sees HALLUCIFER.


HALLUCIFER
Hey, so maybe I’m not real. Nobody’s perfect. And I’m not going anywhere, Sam.


SAM’s eyes close, his head thrashes and his mouth opens.


DEAN
Sam? Sammy?


PARAMEDIC (into communicator)
Yeah, he’s seizing. Copy that. We’re just pulling into Sioux Falls.


DEAN
Sioux Falls? Sioux Falls General? No, no, no. No, you gotta take us somewhere else, anywhere. Please.


PARAMEDIC
Yeah, okay, buddy.


DEAN knocks his head against the pillow in distress.


BOBBY'S SALVAGE YARD – NIGHT


The black ooze retreats back under the car and EDGAR’s hand moves.
