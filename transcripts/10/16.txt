TEASER
INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS

[TERRY in confessional]

TERRY

I detest all my sins because of thy just punishment but most of all because they offend thee, my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasion of sin.

FATHER DELANEY

Amen. I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

TERRY

Amen.

FATHER DELANEY

Go in peace, Terry. See you Sunday.

TERRY

That you will, Father.

[A spirit watches over TERRY as he walks out of the confessional. Terry walks over to a lit candlestick, blows it out, and removes the candle.]

EXT. CHURCH. NIGHT

[TERRY plunges the sharp end of the candle in his chest.]

TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
INT. HELL.

“PAINT IT BLACK”

[A DEMON walks up to CROWLEY’s throne, as he is looking over documents on a clipboard.]

DEMON

Majesty.

[Crowley looks up from his work.]

I beg you to speak with her.

CROWLEY

What now?

DEMON

Your mother remains…vexed your highness and vents her frustration by abusing the court. No one dares retaliate at first, of course, and yes, one expects to suffer in Hell, but I fear I have reached my limit. To wit…

[The DEMON turns around to reveal his face on the back of his head.]

I mean, seriously.

CROWLEY

[Sighs]

Mother!

[ROWENA enters]

ROWENA [Sighing]

Yes, your Royal Highness?

CROWLEY

You care to comment?

[ROWENA SMIRKS]

ROWENA

Magnificent work by an astonishing talent. Mm, Brava! [Applauding herself]

[CROWLEY dismisses the DEMON. He walks past ROWENA.]

I always said you were two-faced.

CROWLEY

Look, Mommy, enough. I know you’re annoyed with me.

ROWENA

Annoyed? No, Fergus. I’m devastated, betrayed [Voice breaking] and brokenhearted.

CROWLEY

Because I wouldn’t go begging to a bunch of witches on your behalf?

ROWENA

The Grand Coven is the supreme command of all witchcraft. Without their sanction, I’m forbidden to practice!

CROWLEY

Forgive me. I hadn’t noticed you stopped.

ROWENA

That? Parlor trick. I’m capable of greatness. Given free reign, I’d be unstoppable.

CROWLEY

I am this close to throwing you back into that dungeon.

ROWENA

Of course. Why not? Why do anything but cause me more pain? Bad enough you wouldn’t intervene with Olivette and the coven, but you went directly against my wishes, siding with those Winchesters, refusing to kill them, then delivering the First Blade into their hands, which you know could slaughter us all. You prefer them to your own flesh and blood. It’s a bitter pill, Fergus; after all I’ve done for you.

CROWLEY

And what exactly would that be?

[ROWENA walks closer to Crowley’s throne.]

ROWENA

I gave you life, Fergus. Without me, sunshine, you wouldn’t exist.

[ROWENA makes her way out the room and a s she does so she throws her hands out to her side.]

Abite!

[Glass in the room explodes]

INT. IMPALA ON THE ROAD-NIGHT

[DEAN is driving and Sam is in the passenger seat.]

DEAN

All right, so I’m thinking, uh, curse, maybe.

[Sam’s mind is somewhere else.]

Sam, a little help here okay? I’m trying to stay busy here. You know, eye on the ball, not on the mark. And this is a case until we know it’s not.

SAM

Sure. No, yeah, you’re right. Three suicides, two weeks.

DEAN

They’re not just suicides. They gutted themselves. And they took their sweet time doing it. I mean, that had to be incredibly painful. I can’t seem to find any link between the vics, either.

SAM

Yeah, probably a curse, I bet.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

SISTER MATHIAS

And this man, he was handsome?

ISABELLA [Italian accent]

Exquisite. He took my breath away. But we are told not to speak so much of the time before we joined the order.

SISTER MATHIAS

We all found our way to this life for a reason. Was he yours?

ISABELLA [VOICE OVER]

His name was Piero, an incredible artist.

INT. ART STUDIO-DAY

[FLASHBACK: ISABELLA and PIERO are in his art studio]

Sometimes, I would pose for him. And he called me his muse.

[PIERO is painting her portrait.]

As you can imagine we spent hours, days with each other. I felt so free with him. I had never been close with a man before like that.

[END OF FLASHBACK]

SISTER MATHIAS

So…what happened?

ISABELLA

I…I can’t right now.

SISTER MATHIAS

It’s okay. Really. We’re a lot alike, you know? I think we’re supposed to enter the convent for some…higher purpose, but many of us chose this because of the things that…overwhelmed us.

EXT.POLICE STATION-DAY

[SAM and DEAN are walking out of the police station, dressed in their Fed suits, to the IMPALA.]

SAM

All right so what do we got? Terry Sloan ordinary guy, not a lot of friends but no known enemies, no relation to the other vics.

DEAN

Well, not necessarily. He’s Catholic, and so are the other two.

SAM

Dean, this is Massachusetts. There are a lot of Catholics in Massachusetts. You think this is a case?

DEAN

Who kills himself with a candlestick, all right? There’s about a billion better ways.

SAM

Yeah, but he did kill himself.

DEAN

All right, so, it was not a witch. There was nothing hexy found on him. Uh, possession? Could have been a demon?

SAM

Yeah, but the point of a demon possession a living thing is to, you know, possess a living thing.

[They arrive at the car, SAM at the passenger side, DEAN at the drivers.]

DEAN

Okay, agent, why don’t you get that cellphone back to the bureau’s crime lab, get it hacked like you told those guys, and, uh, we’ll figure out what’s going on with Terry Sloane.

SAM

Probably nude selfies.

DEAN

I’m feeling good about this.

[They both get into the IMAPLA]

INT. CHURCH-DAY

[A man, FRANK MCCARTHY walks out of the confessional and to his wife, LISA MCCARTHYwho is praying.]

LISA

Amen.

[The spirit watches over them as they exit the church.

INT. MCCARTHY’S HOUSE-NIGHT.

[FRANK opens the refrigerator to make a sandwich. When he turns around LISA is standing there.]

FRANK

Hi, Sweetie.

LISA

You need to come to bed, Frank. You got to be exhausted from all those nigh hours you’ve been putting in.

FRANK [Sighs]

Yep, yep. The old job’s gotten pretty demanding, all right.

[LISA smiles at him but is slowly turns into a glare and the minute he turns his back she grabs a pair of scissors off the counter.]

LISA

Liar.

[FRANK turns around and LISA charges at him with scissors and repeatedly stabs him in the gut]

FRANK

AAH!

[After FRANK dies a cloud of smoke leaves LISA’s body.]

LISA

Oh, my God. No! No! Frank! [LISA SCREAMS]

ACT 2
INT. CHURCH-DAY

[FATHER DELANEY is leading SAM and DEAN into the church]

FATHER DELANEY

I just can’t believe Lisa McCarthy would murder her husband.

SAM

Right, well, his blood was all over her body. And her prints were all over the pair of scissors that butchered him.

FATHER DELANEY

That’s terrible.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Now, we also have some questions. Um, for starters, she has no memory of it. The last thing she remembers is being here. Frank had gone to confession.

SAM

So, if he happened to say anything in the confession about, you know, maybe problems with the wife…

FATHER DELANEY

I’m sorry. The nature of confession is confidential.

SAM

Ah. [Sighs]

DEAN

Father, all of the victims attended your church. Um, could you at least tell us if they had recently been to confession?

FATHER DELANEY

Yes. These men were fairly regular, but then, so are the majority of the folks here.

SISTER MATHIAS

Father?

FATHER DELANEY

Agents,

[DEAN checks out SISTER DELANEY]

Sister Mathias is our Director of Social Services. I’ve asked her to show you around and answer any questions.

SAM

Sure.

[FATHER DELANEY leaves]

DEAN

Sister,

SISTER MATHIAS

Agent…?

DEAN

Allman. And this is Agent Betts.

SAM

Sister, you’re aware of the recent string of deaths, right?

SISTER MATHIAS

Yes, a terrible tragedy. But I’m confused as t why you’re here. These were all suicides, weren’t they?

SAM

Well, possibly not.

SISTER MATHIAS

Murders?

DEAN

Well, the actual method of killing was all identical.

SISTER MATHIAS

Ah, the M.O.

DEAN

Yes, indeed the M.O. [Chuckles]

SAM

I’m going go, uh [Clears his throat] have a look around. Uh, excuse me, sister. Agents Betts, uh, Allman. [Clears his throat]

DEAN

Okay

[SAM walks away and DEAN walks with SISTER MATHIAS]

Uh, Sister, d-did you notice, um, any chance in the—in the McCarthy’s lives? You know fighting, drinking, cheating? You know, the usual.

SISTER MATHIAS

The usual. A bit cynical, Agent?

DEAN

Well, you know, scissors to the gut really, uh, bring out the Grinch in me. [Chuckles] So…

[DEAN and SISTER MATHIAS approach the head of the church where SISTER MATHIAS stops and crosses her body in the proper Catholic fashion. DEAN stands off awkwardly]

Oh… Now Lisa McCarthy said that they were very devoted to each other. Was that true?

SISTER MATHIAS

That always appeared to be the case.

DEAN

But…?

SISTER MATHIAS

We’re looking for a motive aren’t we?

DEAN

We are. An earlier victim’s cellphone showed some angry texts between he and his girlfriend ‘cause he had been fooling around.

SISTER MATHIAS

There were rumors.

DEAN

So, Frank cheated on Lisa. So, she lied to me. Oh, she didn’t know.

SISTER MATHIAS

My sources are excellent. And you didn’t hear it from me.

[DEAN chuckles]

[SAM takes the EMF meter and waves it over the prayer candles, the meter warbles.]

DEAN

I got a question. How does someone, uh, like you end up, you know…?

SISTER MATHIAS

Cloistered away from the world? [Chuckles] Are you making fun of me, Agent Allman?

DEAN

No. No, No. I, Uh… I guess I’m just wondering how somebody quits one life for something completely different and – and then believe in it so much.

SISTER MATHIAS

Well [sighs] in my case, I felt I had no choice. My life had become painful.

There was hopelessness. I felt I had to find something larger than myself to focus on. A kind of mission, I guess. You have no idea what I’m talking about, I’m sure.

DEAN

Mm, don’t be.

SAM

Sister. I got a question.

[SAM approaches DEAN and SISTER MATHIAS]

DEAN

I’m sure it’s a different question.

SAM

Is there a cemetery nearby?

SISTER MATHIAS

You could say that. The entire church is built over burial crypts.

SAM

Oh. Have you ever, uh, heard or – or felt anything strange or unusual?

SISTER MATHIAS

Unusual how?

DEAN

Like, uh, spots in the building that suddenly get cold or, uh – or maybe you feel like you’re not – not quite alone?

SISTER MATHIAS

Rattling chains and teacups that fly across the room?

DEAN

Sister, are you making fun of me?

SISTER MATHIAS

Really? The FBI believes in ghosts? I’m afraid I don’t. If you’ll excuse me, Agents, I have to get back to work.

DEAN

Mm.

[SISTER MATHIAS leaves SAM and DEAN]

EXT. CHURCH-DAY

[DEAN and SAM are walking down the church stairs.]

DEAN

Tell me you didn’t think that nun was hot. I think she had a little thing for me too.

SAM

Dean, she was married to Jesus.

DEAN

All right, so, Frank cheated on his wife, Lisa, all right? You know, the whole theme of this case seems to be about guys doing their women wrong. Notice that?

[They stop in front of the church]

SAM

Yeah, but Lisa McCarthy was pretty convincing that she had no idea whatsoever she had killed her husband.

DEAN

Oh, hot nun said that Lisa had no idea he was cheating on her. So, maybe she was controlled by someone who did.

SAM

Again, nothing witchy.

DEAN

Ghost?

SAM

Hard to say. I mean there’s EMF in the church, but it’s built on a burial ground.

DEAN

You know that all the victims recently went to confession?

SAM

So you think Father Delaney’s involved?

DEAN

Or maybe something surrounding the confessional. Sammy, how long has it been since my last confession?

SAM

You’ve never been to confession.

[SAM walks past DEAN]

DEAN

Well, that’s too long.

[DEAN turns around to follow him]

INT.HELL

[ROWENA walks over to CROWLEY who is on his throne]

ROWENA

You summoned…Your Royal Highness?

[ROWENA gives an exaggerated curtsey.]

CROWLEY

Mother.

ROWENA

Oh, he remembers! What can I do for you?

CROWLEY

It’s what I can do for you. I’ve been thinking just how wretched it would be if my own raison D’ĕtre – wreaking havoc and pain on Earth – were taken from me. I see how stifled you must feel, and I sympathize.

ROWENA

Does this mean that you’ll go to the Grand Coven on my behalf?

[CROWLEY stands.]

CROWLEY

Even better. I’ve brought the coven to you.

[Behind him two demon guards bring in a women.]

I believe you know Olivette,

[ROWENA looks shocked.]

High Priestess of the Grand Coven. Speechless with joy?

[ROWENA whimpers.]

ROWENA

You utter bitch!

OLLIVETTE

Bottom feeder!

CROWLEY

Ah, the storm before the storm. As you can see, the iron chains render her powerless, so you can plead your case, exact your revenge, whatever it is that puts a spring back in your step. You kids have fun now.

[CROWLEY and the other demons step out of the room.]

OLIVETTE

I see your time as outcast has led you from vile to loathsome.

ROWENA

I doubt this strategy of insults will get you out of this pickle.

OLIVETTE

Mm, no. I do not grovel before she who lay with a non-magic and hatches his evil spawn.

ROWENA

My personal life was none of your business. I could have been your superstar.

OLIVETTE

Oh, please! When we initiated your thankless ass into the coven, we did overlook your private lapses because of your talent. We thought you’d outgrown your reckless, selfish ways, but, oh, no, they just grew out of control. And now look at you, consorting with demons.

ROWENA

Quite the speech [Chuckles]

[ROWENA slowly walks over to OLIVETTE and touches her necklace]

Considering you’re in my son’s palace.

[OLIVETTE is appalled at this news. ROWENA lets go of her necklace]

OLIVETTE

What?

[ROWENA chuckles]

ROWENA

You see, my son, the spawn you speak of, is now the King of Hell. Tall Cinderella story, I’d say. [Chuckles] Oh, aye. And now you, dearest Olivette, are prisoner of the baddest of the bad. And his devoted Mummy.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

SISTER MATHIAS

It was the sadness in your eyes. I saw myself there. Was it Piero? Is he the reason you’re here?

ISABELLA

There is not much difference between madness and devotion. I was obsessed with him.

INT. ART STUDIO-DAY

[FLASHBACK: PIERO is caressing ISABELLA’s hair in his art studio.]

ISABELLA [VOICE OVER]

We shared each other’s secrets. We were on the same road. I suddenly realized how deeply in love with Piero I had fallen.

[It is then revealed that ISABELLA is posed for a self portrait that PIERO is painting of her.

He said it was only after I posed for him that his work took on real power, real expression. The painting I had posed for was the beginning of his career. In the end it was his masterpiece.

[“FLORENCE, ITALY 1520”]

ACT III
[SISTER MATHIAS and ISABELLA are continuing their conversation]

SISTER MATHIAS

Sweet Jesus, nothing in my love life was ever so magical.

ISABELLA

Magic can be ruinous, especially if the trick is on you.

INT. ART GALLARY

[FLASHBACK: ISABELLA is speaking with PIERO]

ISABELLA [VOICE OVER]

I finally confessed my heart to Piero. I felt we could read each other’s thoughts. But I said the words inside out loud—“I love you.” I waited, dying inside. And then…he explained he had feelings for me…but not of the same sort.

[END OF FLASHBACK]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

SISTER MATHIAS

He loved another?

ISABELLA

Indeed. His art. It was everything to him. Insomuch that I affected it, he cared for me, but beyond that, he could offer me nothing but friendship. I fell into such despair. I could not eat nor sleep until my family could stand no more.

SISTER MATHIAS

And that’s when you entered the convent.

ISABELLA

It’s as if I’d died. My father sent me there to escape my sorrow and forget Piero. His servants dragged me from home one night.

[SISTER MATHIAS shook her head in disgust]

All these things from my father’s estate—

[On the table are scattered antique items.]

I never saw them again after that night. Everything that was mine was lost too. Except my journal.

[ISABELLA touches her journal which is next to some of the other antique items]

Things I could say to no one, things no one wanted to hear.

SISTER MATHIAS

Loneliness is…

ISABELLA

Yes. It is.

INT. HELL

[ROWENA slaps OLIVETTE across the face. She is tied up in a chair.]

OLIVETTE

[Chuckles] Well, I really can’t say I’m surprised. You always were petulant and reckless and overrated. Banishment was too good for you.

[ROWENA slaps her again]

Ooh!

[ROWENA chuckles]

[Blood trickles down OLIVETTE’s nose]

ROWENA

You were always so envious of my skills, you fool. The only threat I ever posed to the coven was that I was smarter, more gifted than you!

OLIVETTE

More blindly ambitious!

ROWENA

Why not? You nits were content to live in the shadows, dicking around with black cats and broomsticks instead of greatness.

[ROWENA slaps OLIVETTE once again.]

OLIVETTE

Ohh!! [Coughs] What was that one for?

ROWENA

Emphasis. I will get what I want from you.

OLIVETTE

No, you won’t.

[ROWENA pulls her hand back to slap OLIVETTE]

Because what you are looking for no longer exists.

[ROWENA pauses.]

The coven is a pale relic of its past power, weakened by witch-hunts, burning at the stake, endless persecution; all of it was engineered by them.

ROWENA

Them?

OLIVETTE

Oh. [Chuckles.] Not as quick as I’d thought.

[ROWENA raises her hand, threatening to poke her eyes.]

[Gasp] All right!

It’s a rabid group of sanctimonious do-gooders dedicated to our downfall.

ROWENA

They had equal magic?

OLIVETTE

Worse – public relations. They whipped the church and the public into a panic. Our best were killed or driven underground. They then plundered our spells and secrets and shipped them to hidden bunkers all around the world.

ROWENA

It appears you hate them more than you do me.

OLIVETTE

They tried to destroy our world! Hoarding unbelievable power for their own amusement. Smug, self-righteous bastards. The Men of Letters.

[ROWENA sighs]

INT. CONFESSIONAL-DAY

[FATHER DELANEY sits in confessional when he hears a knock on the window]

FATHER DELANEY

Yes?

[He opens the window to see DEAN sitting on the other side]

DEAN

Hiya, Father.

FATHER DELANEY

Pardon me?

DEAN

Pardon you?! I thought it was the other way around. [Chuckles] Just…it’s…[clears throat] so, uh, I’m here to – here to clean house. I need to get some things off my chest.

FATHER DELANEY

Oh. All right. Continue.

DEAN

Um…it’s the women, Father. Where do I begin? [Chuckles]

FATHER DELANEY

“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,” is usual.

DEAN

Right. Good. Yeah. So, that, and, um…so the women. Uh, and this is not something that I’m proud of, but I let them think that we have more of a future than we do, you know? Ah, Gina.

FATHER DELANEY

Gina?

DEAN

Well, now, don’t get me wrong. I mean, she was – it was good times. I mean, you know how it is – the sex, the lasagna – but I was not honest with her. And sometimes, I was seeing two, maybe three girls at the same time, sometimes in the same day. [Chuckles] you get the picture. And it wasn’t just Gina. It was endless. It’s making me sick.

FATHER DELANEY

And you wish to be forgiven, my son?

DEAN

I do. I need to clean up my act.

FATHER DELANEY

As penance, you shall say five “Hail Mary’s” two “Our Father’s”, and reflect on your transgression.

DEAN

And then, that’s it? then I’m good to go?

FATHER DELANEY

One would hope some…inner exploration might occur. The prayers are just the beginning to some serious soul-searching.

DEAN

Hmm.

[DEAN pauses for a second to think]

FATHER DELANEY

Is there anything else on your mind, Agent Allman?

DEAN

[Chuckles] What if I said I…I didn’t want to die…yet, you know, that I wasn’t ready?

FATHER DELANEY

Are you expecting to?

DEAN

Always. [Chuckles] You know, the life I live, the work I do…I pretty much just figured that that was all there was to me, you know? Tear around and jam the key in the ignition and haul ass until I ran out of gas. I guess I just thought sooner or later, I’d go out the same way that I live – pedal to the metal, and that would be it.

FATHER DELANEY

But now?

DEAN

Now, um… recent events, uh… make me think I might be closer to that than I really thought. And…I don’t know. I mean, you know, there’s – there’s things, there’s…people, feelings that I-I-I want to experience differently than I have before, or maybe even for the first time.

FATHER DELANEY

Go a little deeper, perhaps, than with Gina.

DEAN

Yeah. Yeah, I’m just starting to think that… maybe there’s more to it all than I thought.

FATHER DELANEY

Learning there’s more to the universe than your tiny world can be a frightening discovery. Do you truly believe in God, Agent? Because that can be a comfort

DEAN

I believe there is a God. But I’m not sure he still believes in us.

[DEAN exits the confessional and behind him, ISABELLA’s ghost, appears. DEAN walks over to SAM who is sitting the pew. He gets up when he see’s DEAN.]

SAM

So, you thin you had an eavesdropper in there?

DEAN

Hope so.

SAM

You better watch your back. If we were right, jerks like you are just what our ghost is looking for.

[DEAN and SAM exit the church. SISTER MATHIAS stands off in the corner watching SAM and DEAN.]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-DAY

[SISTER MATHIAS unlocks the basement doors]

SISTER MATHIAS

[Whispering] Isabella? Isabella? Are you here?

INT. CHURCH- DAY

[A woman walks out of the confessional and FATHER DELANEY exits shortly after. ISABELLA’s spirit watches over him. After making his way to the front of the church, he crosses his body, and ISABELLA’s spirit takes over him.]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-DAY

[SISTER MATHIAS grabs ISABELLA’s journal and begins reading it.]

SISTER MATHIAS

“Obscuri funesti dies…”

INT. ART GALLARY-NIGHT

[FLASHBACK: ISABELLA enters the art gallery.]

ISABELLA [VOICE OVER]

I found no peace in the convent, and my sorrow turned to rage. What was once love for Peiro had become hatred. One night, I snuck out a window and made my way to his studio. I’m not sure why I went.

[Next to the self portrait of herself, ISABELLA grabbed a paintbrush with red paint on it.]

To confront him? To ruin the painting and destroy his love the way he destroyed mine?

[ISABELLA confronts the portrait with the paintbrush about to ruin the painting.]

[A woman in the room is heard moaning.]

There they were.

[A woman and PIERO were having sex on a bed in the room. ISABELLA see’s a knife on the corner of the table. Distraught, ISABELLA watches Piero and this woman have sex. She holds the knife over PIERO’s body but the woman see’s her and screams. ]

PIERO

Isabella.

[ISABELLA plunges the knife into PIERO’s chest, repeatedly while the woman screams on the floor. Once dead, ISABELLA smiles at his body, blood all over her clothes.]

[FLASHBACK ENDS]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-DAY

[SISTER MATHIAS shuts the journal and looks frightened.]

ACT IV
[SAM and DEAN follow SISTER MATHIAS in the church basement]

SISTER MATHIAS

I never mentioned her to you because it didn’t occur to me she was connected with the murders. Ever since I’ve been here I’ve come across restless spirits of all sorts.

They’re all kind of…sad, harmless. And eventually, the poor things go to their final rest.

SAM

Wait a second. S-so, you’re just comfortable around ghosts?

SISTER MATHIAS

As a spiritual person, I’ve accepted many planes of existence. And as I said, they’ve all been harmless. Isabella was my friend. We had a lot in common, including… painful love lives. I wanted to protect her.

DEAN

You said she showed up about three weeks ago when stuff from her home arrived?

SISTER MATHIAS

Yes, part of a shipment from a monastery in Tivoli. Her family’s treasures found their way to the church, as with many of the great houses of Europe.

SAM

You get that she got here just before the murders started happening?

SISTER MATHIAS

I finally realized that. And then I heard the two of you, and it made me wonder. That’s when I read her journal. It was given to her father right after her death.

[SISTER MATHAS picks up the journal]

DEAN

Vengeful spirit, just like we thought.

SAM

Yeah, but 16th- Century Florence. She’s probably buried in Florence.

SISTER MATHIAS

I assume. The – journal ended right after her trial.

[She hands the journal to SAM.]

Piero’s death was so horrific, she was convicted of witchcraft. They sentenced her to burn at the stake.

DEAN

Okay, well, if she burned, then so would her bones.

SAM

Yeah, but, Dean, something here is the tether that ties her to this place.

DEAN

It’s probably the journal, where she wrote about her life. [To SISTER MATHIAS] Why don’t we see if we can’t find Isabella, try to slow her down. Sam, burn all this stuff.

SISTER MATHIAS

Her… journal? Is that necessary?

DEAN

Believe me, it’s necessary.

SAM

Well, I don’t know, Dean. I mean, there might be more in here.

DEAN

Sam, burn it. Lets go.

[DEAN exits and SISTER MATHIAS follows.]

INT. HELL

[ROWENA is punching OLIVETTE repeatedly in the face.]

OLIVETTE

[Weakly] I’m telling you I don’t know any more.

ROWENA

You’re lying, just as you lied about me all these years. You’re afraid I’ll recover all the stolen potions and spells and become more powerful than you.

OLIVETTE

Oh, poor, poor Rowena. Always the victim of one conspiracy or another. You’re so consumed with your rise of power, you can’t see the truth.

ROWENA

I see the truth, and it’s pathetic. You let these Men Of Letters pillage the greatest trove of magical secrets in the world and did nothing.

[ROWENA kicks OLIVETTE in the shin.]

OLIVETTE

Ow! We were weakened. The plunder was dispersed to bunkers all around the world. Those bunkers are powerfully warded. There was nothing we could do to stop them.

ROWENA

How do I find the Men Of Letters?

OLIVETTE

I don’t even know if they exist anymore. I’ve heard that the American chapter was extinguished in the 1950’s, but apparently, two of it’s members survive – the hunters, Sam and Dean Winchester.

ROWENA

[Laughing] The Winchesters?

[OLIVETTE spits blood]

Again with the Winchesters. Perpetually, the Winchesters. [Sighs] Olivette, dear... pleasant though this little chat has been, I feel it’s come…

[ROWENA makes a fist in front of OLIVETTE’s face. OLIVETTE gasps.]

…to a close.

What you’re telling me is that the coven is no longer all powerful and, therefore, that you are no longer useful.

OLIVETTE

You better be careful, Rowena. There’s a line that cannot be crossed. Witch-on-witch murder is anathema to the community.

ROWENA

[Scoffs] The community? [Chuckles, snorts] Who needs them? [Sigh] To think of all the years I’ve lived in fear for nothing. You ruined my life, Olivette, and you shall pay with yours. [Humming “Scotland The Brave”]

OLIVETTE

Rowena, please, you don’t want to this.

[ROWENA grabs a bowl with various objects in it and places it on the ground in front of Olivette. She kneels behind it and takes

Please, Rowena, don’t do this. Rowena, please.

[In small bag she dumps bones and feathers into the bowl.]

Please stop.

[ROWENA grabs a handful of red sand to pour into the bowl]

ROWENA

Cruciatus letumque crucianti!

[She throws the sand into the bowl and a bright red flame burst out of it. OLIVETTE begins to convulse, and blood pours out of her mouth.]

OLIVETTE

[Screaming]

[ROWENA LAUGHS]

ROWENA

Halt!

[ROWENA stands up and OLIVETTE stops convulsing.]

I haven’t thought this through. Why should I kill you, give you an easy way out [chuckling] when there are far better options? Fatum tuum est itersine

OLIVETTE

No!

ROWENA

Termino ad…

OLIVETTE

No! No! [Struggling to escape her chains] Rowena please!

ROWENA

….Nulum!

OLIVETTE

No!!!

ROWENA

[Chuckles] Oh, I’m a genius.

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[SISTER MATHIAS and DEAN are walking around the church, DEAN holds his EMF meter]

SISTER MATHIAS

I don’t see how she could murder these people. If she was tethered to the church.

DEAN

She could possess a person inside the church, ride out, and get yanked back after the kill, so…

SISTER MATHIAS

And can ghosts be shot?

[DEAN holds up his shotgun]

DEAN

This is rock salt. If we spot her, it’ll slow her down.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[SAM is reading ISABELLA’s journal]

ISABELLA [VOICE OVER]

And as the days passed, my love for Piero deepened, as did his belief in my powers as his muse.

INT. ART GALLARY-NIGHT

[FLASHBACK: ISABELLA and Piero sit by the window over candlelight]

He said he wanted something from me, something he could barely give voice to.

[ISABELLA gently caresses his face. She holds her hand out, palm up, for Piero.]

He thought the effect I had on his work was profound. He had never pained so well before. He asked if he might have a bit of my blood to mix to the pigment.]

[Piero, grabs a knife and slices her hand.]

Piero was so afraid he would hurt me.

[ISABELLA moans]

I told him, on the contrary, it was my great joy to do this.

[PIERO, speaking Italian apologizes and wipes off the blood with a cloth.]

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[DEAN and SISTER MATHIAS enter a hallway and the EMF meter begins to warble. The sound gets stronger and DEAN gestures for SISTER MATHIAS to stay put. DEAN continues on.]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[SAM continues to read ISABELLA’s journal]

INT. ART GALLARY-NIGHT

[FLASHBACK]

ISABELLA [VOICE OVER]

But it wasn’t enough.

[ISABELLA cuts off her own finger.]

Ohh! [Breathing heavily]

[She quickly wraps it in a cloth]

I told Piero to gind the flesh, blood, and bone into the pigment.

[ISABELLA hands her severed finger to PIERO.]

I had completely become one with the painting and with Piero.

SAM & ISABELLA

“And with Piero.”

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[Sam closes the journal. He looks behind him and finds boarded up paintings]

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[DEAN walks further into a room and then sees FATHER DELANEY lying on top of a table, gutted.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[SAM frantically searches for ISABELLA’s painting.

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[DEAN walks out of the room.]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[SAM pulls painting after painting aside, trying to find the proper one. He finally finds one that reads “TIVOLI’ on the stamp]

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[DEAN walks over to SISTER MATHIAS]

DEAN

She got to Father Delaney. She’s around here somewhere. We got to get you out of here. Come on!

[DEAN grabs her hand to lead her out of the church but she resists. SISTER MATHIAS then slaps DEAN, sending flying down the hallway.]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[SAM uses a crowbar to open the crate that had ISABELLA’s painting in it.]

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[SISTER MATHIAS flickers toward DEAN who is struggling to get up. She grabs him.]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[SAM gets the crate open.]

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[SISTER MATHIAS throws DEAN up against the wall, but, has a strong grip around his neck.]

DEAN

[Grunting]

[SISTER MATHIAS pulls a knife from her sleeve. DEAN uses his free hand to grab her knife holding hand. She struggles to plunge the knife in DEAN’s stomach.]

SISTER MATHIAS

The priest had to die. He made it his business to forgive you pigs – forgive you, when what you do is unforgivable.

DEAN

[Strained] Sam, burn the journal!

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[SAM puts the painting in the fireplace.]

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[DEAN struggles, not only, to keep the knife from plunging into his gut, but to keep breathing.]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[SAM douses the painting in lighter fluid, lights a pack of matches and throws it into fire pit, burning the painting.]

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[SISTER MATHIAS lets go of DEAN and her body begins to convulse. ISABELLA’s spirits bursts out SISTER MATHIAS, who falls to the ground.]

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT-NIGHT

[ISABELLA’S painting continues to burn.]

INT. CHURCH-NIGHT

[SISTER MATHIAS grabs hold of DEAN, and he protects her as ISABELLA goes up in flames.]

ISABELLA

Sister! Don’t let them! You are my friend. [Screaming.]

[ISABELLA burns.]

ACT V

INT. HELL

[ROWENA watches gleefully as a hamster is spinning around on a hamster wheel.]

[ROWENA chuckles]

ROWENA

You’re – ooh, you’re trucking.

[CROWLEY enters]

CROWLEY

Is that her?

ROWENA

[Sigh] Poetic justice, if you ask me. For hundreds of years, those hags made me grovel, every attempt to please them futile. High time someone else ran in circles, eh? [Chuckles]

CROWLEY

Nice touch. Something I might have thought of myself.

ROWENA

You see, we’re not so very different.

CROWLEY

What is it that you want?

ROWENA

[Sighs] Well, Fergus, since you asked, these friends of yours – the Winchesters – I hear they are, oh, what do you call it, um, Men Of Letters?

CROWLEY

Possibly.

ROWENA

I see. Well, about that –

CROWLEY

Listen, we’ve been through this. My relationship with the Winchesters is my business. I’ll handle them. I’m not killing them.

ROWENA

All right, deary. Of course. Whatever you say.

[ROWENA pats his shoulder and walks away.]

INT. IMPALA ON THE ROAD-NIGHT

[SAM is driving and DEAN is in the passenger seat]

DEAN

Who mixes their blood and bones into paint? No woman’s ever done that for me. [Chuckles]

SAM

Is this you thanking me for not doing what you told me to do?

DEAN

You know, if you would have burned the journal, then we wouldn’t know how to kill it, would we?

[SAM chuckles]

SAM

Yeah you’re welcome.

[They both chuckle.]

You know… you were in that confessional a long time. Look, man, I’m just saying, I’m your brother, Dean. If you ever need to talk about anything with anybody, you got somebody right here next to you.

DEAN

Okay.

SAM

I heard what Sister Mathias was saying about, you know, hiding pain by taking on a mission, and I-I know that’s what you’re doing a little bit. And it’s okay. I mean, it’s fine. I get it. I’ve done it before, too. But… I don’t buy for one second that the mark is a terminal diagnosis, so don’t go making peace with that idea. There has to be a way. There will be a way, and we will find it. That’s what we do. So, believe that.

DEAN

Okay, Sammy.

SAM

You want to… Uh, try that again like you mean it?

DEAN

[More determined] Okay.

[The IMPALA drives off into the night.]
