TEASER


EXTERIOR – MALTA – NIGHT

[A view of the Monastery from outside, near the river.]

INTERIOR – HOLY SISTERS OF MALTA MONASTERY – NIGHT

[Three nuns exit through a door, as a man, MIELE, with a torch comes out from behind them. He enters a room of relics and begins to admire the Skull of St. Peter, that sits in a glass box. He breaks the glass and takes the skull, placing it inside a bag. He turns to leave, but a nun is standing behind him. He knocks to the ground, and she lies unconscious.]

MIELE

[speaking in Italian] So sorry, Mother. Please forgive me.

[He leaves as the nun is still lying on the floor.]

[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE


INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, KITCHEN – DAY

[SAM is sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, as DEAN enters and walks to the fridge.]

DEAN

So?

SAM

What?

DEAN

You find anything on the Seal of Solomon?

SAM

Well, I’ve been digging through the lore, but so far, nothing.

DEAN

Great. So we got Cas in Syria dodging bullets, trying to find fruit from the Tree of Life. We don’t know where Lucifer is, so we can’t get grace from an archangel. And uh, what’s the last ingredient of this spell we’re never gonna find?

[DEAN sits down across from SAM with a box of pizza.]

SAM

Blood of a most holy man.

DEAN

A most holy man. What – what – what does that mean?

SAM

No idea. I’ve been thinking maybe, uh, blood of a saint?

DEAN

A saint?

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Yeah, should be easy to get.

SAM

Well, actually, uh, turns out there’s a huge market for religious relics. Hair of a martyr, um, nails from the True Cross.

DEAN

Okay, okay. One, ew. Two, where is this market?

SAM

Online.

DEAN

Ah. The internet. Not just for porn anymore.

[DEAN takes a bite of pizza.]

SAM

Anyway, a lot of this is fake, obviously, but I-I did find one dealer who seems to be legit – Margaret Astor. Worth a shot?

DEAN

Yeah. Good. Why not? I don’t think I can take another one of these cold pieces of Papa Giovanni’s.

[DEAN puts the slice back and closes the box.]

EXTERIOR – SAN FRANCISCO – DAY

[A shot of the Golden Gate Bridge, boats in the water and cars on the bridge.]

INTERIOR – RESTAURANT – DAY

[MARGARET is sitting at a table and sipping a Martini. SAM and DEAN approach her.]

DEAN

Miss Astor?

MARGARET

Ms. will do.

SAM

Of course. Great. Uh, may we sit?

MARGARET

Please. So, gentlemen, what can I do for you?

SAM

Okay, we, um, we’re interested in obtaining a very rare religious artefact, and – and we were told that maybe you’d be the person to help us out.

MARGARET

Really?

SAM

Yeah.

MARGARET

Who told you that?

DEAN

The internet.

MARGARET

So… this is not a personal recommendation?

SAM

No. Um, is – is that a problem?

MARGARET

Personal relationships are very important to me.

[MARGARET reaches across the table and places her hand on SAM’s clasped hands. He jumps a little, as DEAN eyes the interaction. She takes her hand away.]

SAM

Right. Well, um… I would personally appreciate any help you could give us.

[SAM reaches over and places his hand over MARGARET’s.]

MARGARET

What sort of help do you need?

SAM

We need, um… the blood of a saint.

MARGARET

Really?

SAM

Yeah.

MARGARET

What ever for?

DEAN
Does it matter?

MARGARET

I was asking...

[MARGARET looks at SAM.]

SAM

Sam.

MARGARET

Sam.

[DEAN and MARGARET look annoyed at each other, before she turns her attention to SAM.]

MARGARET

So, Sam, what can you tell me?

SAM

Unfortunately, not very much. Just that it’s very, very important to us. To me.

MARGARET

Well, of course it is. Blood of a saint – very rare, very expensive. It just so happens I might know one person who would have such an item. Do I dare give you the name?

SAM

Please. I would be very much in your debt.

[MARGARET and SAM smile at each other, as DEAN rolls his eyes.]

MARGARET

Well, that’s lovely. But know, Sam… I like to collect on what’s owed to me. His name is Richard Greenstreet. He lives in Seattle. I’ll provide an introduction, but that’s as far as I’ll go.

SAM

Perfect. Thank you.

MARGARET

Oh, don’t thank me yet. Greenstreet has all the trappings of a gentleman, but… I would advise caution.

INTERIOR – SEATTLE, GREENSTREET’S HOME – DAY

[GREENSTREET is standing and eating a donut, as SAM and DEAN watch him.]

GREENSTREET

Your names again?

DEAN

This is Sam. I’m Dean Vaughn. We’re from Rhode Island.

GREENSTREET

Rhode Island. My, you are a long way from home. Do you happen to know the Machin twins out of Newport?

SAM

The Machin twins? Uh, well, we don’t know them personally, but obviously, we know of them.

GREENSTREET

Mm. Interesting. Because to the best of my knowledge, there are no Machin twins from Newport. So who are you really?

DEAN

This is Sam. I’m Dean Winchester. We were told that you might have something that we need.

GREENSTREET

What might that be?

SAM

Blood of a saint.

GREENSTREET

Blood of a saint. Why… yes. I do believe I possess such an item. Cost me a small fortune to obtain.

SAM

Right. We need some for a worthy cause.

GREENSTREET

I gave up on worthy causes years ago. And as I said, the blood cost me a fortune. Judging by your Montgomery Ward suits and your cheap ties, I’m guessing you don’t have a small fortune, or for that matter, two nickels to rub together. So I’m quite afraid this has been a waste of your time, and more importantly, mine. Good day, gentlemen.

[GREENSTREET goes back to eating a donut, as SAM and DEAN turn to leave.]

GREENSTREET

Wait.

[SAM and DEAN turn around to face GREENSTREET.]

GREENSTREET

I suppose we can be of service to one another. Since you had the nerve to come in here under false pretences, I assume you won’t be above a little bit of chicanery. Hmm?

SAM

Yes.

DEAN

We’re listening.

GREENSTREET

Sit.

[SAM and DEAN walk over and sit down at the chairs across from GREENSTREET.]

GREENSTREET

A short while ago, a valuable item that I covet was removed from its ancestral home in Malta. I believe the thief was working for a man named Santino Scarpatti.

DEAN

Scarpatti, the mob boss?

GREENSTREET

You’ve heard of him.

DEAN

I’ve heard enough to know he kills people.

GREENSTREET

Oh, yes. I suppose he does. In any case, here is my proposal – you procure said item for me, and I will trade it for the blood.

SAM

And what kind of item is it that we’re talking about?

GREENSTREET

The skull of St. Peter.

DEAN

Okay… we steal the skull from the head of the Seattle mob. In exchange, you’ll give us the blood of…

GREENSTREET

St. Ignatius. Hmm. That’s correct.

DEAN

Yeah. We can do that. No problem. What else can you tell us?

GREENSTREET

Rumor has it, the skull is supposed to be turned over tomorrow night. Unfortunately, I don’t know the name of the thief or where the meet is supposed to take place.

DEAN

That’s not a lot to go on.

GREENSTREET

I have faith.

EXTERIOR – SEATTLE, GREENSTREET’S HOME – DAY

[SAM and DEAN are leaving GREENSTREET’s home.]

SAM

So, this is what we’ve come to? Thieves?

DEAN

Hey, you want the blood, right? Well… besides, the thing’s already stolen.

SAM

Really? That’s your rationale?

DEAN

Hey, I’m not perfect. And by the way, neither are you, okay? Oh, so, what? Now you’re above a little, uh, chicanery? Look, this isn’t a perfect world we’re trying to save, okay. And if I’m not perfect trying to save it, then so be it. Come on. You with me or not?

[DEAN gets into the Impala, as SAM follows.]

INTERIOR – CAFÉ – DAY

[DEAN is at the counter with coffee. He turns around to see a woman at a table behind him, reading. He walks over to her.]

DEAN

Watcha readin’?

[The WOMAN looks up and smiles, showing DEAN the book.]

WOMAN

A book on the supernatural.

DEAN

Really? So, you’re into the supernatural?

WOMAN

I am.

DEAN

I should sit down.

[The WOMAN laughs as DEAN is about to sit down.]

SAM

Dean. Hey.

DEAN

[to the WOMAN] Excuse me.

WOMAN

Sure.

[DEAN walks over to the table SAM is sitting at and sits down.]

SAM

I got it.

DEAN

[annoyed] Nice timing. What?

[DEAN looks back at the WOMAN as SAM speaks.]

SAM

Alright, get this. So, I hacked into airline records and checked the names of anybody and everybody who travelled from Malta to Seattle in the first three days after the skull was stolen. There were five people. The fifth guy named, uh… Antonio Miele. With little past I can dig up on him seems… checkered.

DEAN

Sounds a little thin, but you wouldn’t happen to know where this Miele guy is right now, would you?

SAM

As a matter of fact, I do. He checked into the Patricia Hotel right here in downtown Seattle yesterday.

INTERIOR – PATRICIA HOTEL – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN walk into the hotel reception. As they walk to the elevator, a man exits and bumps into SAM.]

SAM

Excuse me. I…

[The man looks at SAM and then walks away.]

SAM

Alright.

[He walks into the elevator.]

INTERIOR – HOTEL HALLWAY – NIGHT

[DEAN walks down the hallway as SAM follows. They get to the room they are looking for but find the door ajar. SAM opens the door to see the room is in a mess. They both walk as SAM shuts the door. They walk around the room when DEAN notices something.]

DEAN

Hey.

SAM

Oh.

[They look to the side of the bed and see a man, dead on the floor. They crouch down beside the body.]

DEAN

Well, rest in peace, Antonio Miele.

ACT TWO
br>

DEAN

What the hell happened here?

[A gun cocks behind them.]

FAKE COP

Hands up. No sudden moves.

[SAM and DEAN stand up with their hands up, turning around to see the COP has a gun and a badge in his hands.]

DEAN

Take it easy, take it easy. Hold on just a second.

FAKE COP

Move towards the window.

SAM

Yep, yep. Of course.

[They move to the window.]

FAKE COP

Now sit down. And cuff yourselves to the radiator.

[The FAKE COP throws two pair of cuffs on the ground. SAM and DEAN sit down and cuff themselves to the radiator. The MAN starts searching the room.]

DEAN

You know there’s a dead body over here.

FAKE COP

I see him.

SAM

What department are you with?

FAKE COP

Shut up.

SAM

Where’s your partner?

FAKE COP

I work alone. I said shut up.

DEAN

Maybe you should call this in.

FAKE COP

I said shut up!

[The FAKE COP walks over and points the gun at DEAN’s head.]

FAKE COP

I’m gonna go call this in right now. Don’t you two go anywhere.

[The FAKE COP laughs as he leaves the room.]

DEAN

You see that badge? It’s like he got it out of a cereal box.

SAM

Yeah. Gun looked real enough, though.

DEAN

I don’t think he’s coming back, but he probably is calling it in, so…

[SAM takes out keys to open the cuffs with.]

DEAN

Look at you. You’re like a Boy Scout. You’re always prepared.

SAM

Yeah. You’re like uh… I don’t know what you’re like.

DEAN

Yeah. Thanks.

[SAM opens both their cuffs and they both leave the room.]

INTERIOR – PATRICIA HOTEL – NIGHT

[DEAN and SAM exit an elevator and walk through the reception. The man SAM bumped into before is now sitting in the reception, reading a newspaper. He watches them leave.]

EXTERIOR – STREET – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN are walking down the street.]

DEAN

Alright, so if the dead guy on the floor up there, Miele, was the original thief, then who killed him?

SAM

I don’t know. Maybe Greenstreet got to him before we could. In that case, he probably has the skull.

DEAN

Well, then who’s the fake cop? Who does he work for?

SAM

Scarpatti?

DEAN

No, he was still looking for something. Why would Scarpatti whack the guy before he finds the skull?

SAM

“Whack”?

DEAN

It’s mob talk.

SAM

Mob… Well, colorful.

DEAN

Yeah.

[They turn a corner and see three mob guys standing near the Impala.]

DEAN

Call I help you, fellas?

MOB GUY

Mr. Scarpatti wants to see you two.

DEAN

I think we’ll pass.

MOB GUY

Yeah, that, uh, wasn’t a request.

[Another mob guy takes out his gun and points it at DEAN.]

SAM

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay, okay.

MOB GUY

I’ll drive.

DEAN

I don’t think so.

MOB GUY

Again, not a request.

[The other mob guy gestures for SAM and DEAN to get into the Impala.]

SAM

It’s good.

MOB GUY

Come on.

SAM

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

[SAM sits in the back of the Impala. DEAN walks over and hands the keys to the MOB GUY.]

MOB GUY

Nice car.

DEAN

Yeah. Enjoy.

[DEAN sits in the back, and they drive off. The man SAM bumped into is watching from around the corner.]

EXTERIOR – SCARPATTI MANSION – NIGHT

[The Impala is parked outside, as a henchman stands guard.]

INTERIOR – SCARPATTI MANSION – NIGHT

[SCARPATTI is sitting at his desk, patting his cat. Italian opera plays as the mob guys lead SAM and DEAN into the room.]

SCARPATTI

Sit. Sit.

[SAM and DEAN sit down on a sofa, their backs facing SCARPATTI.]

SCARPATTI

So… Sam and Dean Winchester. We uh… we done a little checkin’. You know? And, uh… you know, officially… you guys both died six years ago.

[SCARPATTI stands up and walks over to the sofa, standing behind them.]

SAM

Well, it’s a funny story. So-

SCARPATTI

Hey, look, I-I don’t care.

SAM

Right.

SCARPATTI

You know, my point is that, if you were to get whacked now… relax. If I wanted you dead… you got my point, right?

SAM

Yep.

SCARPATTI

Good. So, so let’s talk. Alright? I understand you made a deal with Greenstreet?

SAM

How do you know that?

SCARPATTI

I keep any eye on my enemies. Now… that was your first mistake, working for him. Greenstreet… he’s – he’s a farabutto. You know, a scoundrel. He’s got no reverence for these sacred artefacts. He – he has no respect. Now me? You know, my motives are pure. I feel it’s my duty as a good Catholic to give these beautiful relics a home.

DEAN

Well… technically, the relic had a home, and then you had it stolen.

[SAM clears his throat and glares at DEAN. SCARPATTI and his mob guys laugh as they look at DEAN.]

SCARPATTI

Now why would you get involved with a man like Greenstreet?

SAM

He has something we need. And the skull was our – our price we had to pay for it.

SCARPATTI

It’s a devil’s bargain.

[SCARPATTI sits down across from SAM and DEAN.]

SCARPATTI

Alright. So, I’m gonna tell you what you should know, okay? I made a deal with Miele. I paid half the price for the skull up-front and I agreed to give him the rest on delivery. But now he’s dead. And believe me, I didn’t kill him. So, the skull is missing. Now since I paid half of what was owed, I believe that skull rightfully belongs to me.

DEAN

But it was stolen. I don’t know, “rightfully belongs to you”?

[SCARPATTI laughs at DEAN.]

SCARPATTI

You believe this guy? You got a set on you, pal. You talk to me like that in this room?

DEAN

And?

SCARPATTI

My point is, whatever the case is, you two now are in the middle of this thing, alright? So, I’m gonna make you a very nice proposition. You find my skull, and I will give you a handsome finder’s fee. And then you can buy whatever it is you need to get from Greenstreet, okay?

SAM

And what if we say no?

SCARPATTI

That would be your second mistake. And believe me, you probably won’t get a third one.

DEAN

Great. Deal.

SCARPATTI

Good. Very good.

DEAN

Now… what happens if we can’t find the skull?

SCARPATTI

As they say at NASA, failure… is not an option.

INTERIOR – PATRICIA HOTEL – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN walk through the front door.]

SAM

Alright, tell me, why are we here again?

DEAN

Gotta start somewhere. Key to this whole thing is in that room. I can feel it.

SAM

Oh. Oh, you can feel it? Why didn’t you say so?

INTERIOR – HOTEL HALLWAY – NIGHT

[DEAN walks around the corner as SAM follows, but stops. He hides behind the wall.]

SAM

What?

DEAN

Cop.

[There is a cop standing outside the room they were in before, yellow tape blocking the door.]

SAM

Great. Any ideas?

[DEAN sees a fire alarm on the wall.]

DEAN

Stay here.

[DEAN pulls the alarm and walks away, leaving SAM to stand there. The cop at the door starts getting people out of their rooms. DEAN walks to the reception and pulls another alarm. He watches as people exit the reception. SAM hides while the cop walks past. When he is gone, SAM walks to the room, and enters under the yellow tape.]

INTERIOR – HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT
[The room is still in the same mess it was before. SAM starts searching for the skull. He lifts and throws things out of the way, but he can’t find anything.]

SAM

[to himself] Really, Dean? You can feel it.

[SAM starts searching the drawers of an old dresser. He sees a piece of paper under the dresser and picks it up. He reads the numbers written on it, but someone knocks him out with the telephone from behind. He falls to the ground. It is the man SAM bumped into earlier.]

ACT THREE


EXTERIOR – PATRICIA HOTEL – NIGHT

[There are several people and cops outside, after the alarm was set off. The man leaves the hotel, carrying a briefcase. He walks down the street, as the fake cop from before is hiding. The fake cop follows behind the man.]

INTERIOR – HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

[DEAN opens the door.]

DEAN

Alright. We’re good to go.

[DEAN sees SAM knocked out on the floor. He walks over to him.]

DEAN

Sam? Sammy!

[DEAN checks SAM’s pulse and sighs in relief.]

EXTERIOR – ALLEYWAY – NIGHT

[The fake cop is following behind the man, with a gun.]

EXTERIOR – PATRICIA HOTEL – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN leave the hotel and start walking.]

DEAN

Sure you’re not drowsy? How many fingers am I holding up?

[DEAN holds up three fingers, but SAM ignores him.]

SAM

I’m fine.

DEAN

Okay, I’m just saying, you’re taking a lot of shots to the head lately. I mean, I know that Disney Princess hair gives you some padding, but, uh…

[They hear noises coming from the alley and run in that direction.]

EXTERIOR – ALLEYWAY – NIGHT

[The man is lying on the ground, knocked out. SAM and DEAN stand above him.]

SAM

Yeah, that’s him. Or at least I think that’s the guy.

DEAN

Alright, well, if he clocked you, then who clocked him?

[The man starts to open his eyes. SAM gestures to DEAN as they see the man waking up.]

INTERIOR – PATRICIA HOTEL – NIGHT

[SAM, DEAN and the man, FATHER LUCCA, are sitting in the reception area. DEAN is going through the man’s wallet. The man is holding a cloth to where he was knocked in the head.]

DEAN

Where is it?

SAM

The piece of paper you took off me – where is it?

MAN/FATHER LUCCA

I don’t… He took it.

SAM

He? He who?

MAN/FATHER LUCCA

The other man. I-I don’t know. I didn’t see his face.

DEAN

Great. That’s awesome.

SAM

Okay, okay. Let’s start from the beginning. Who are you?

FATHER LUCCA

My name… my name is Lucca Camilleri.

[DEAN shows SAM the wallet.]

DEAN

Uh, Father Lucca Caman… yeri.

[DEAN throws the wallet to SAM.]

SAM

You’re a priest?

FATHER LUCCA

Si.

SAM

Why are you here?

FATHER LUCCA

I’m searching for something.

DEAN

Let me guess – about yea big, used to be some holy dude’s brain basket?

FATHER LUCCA

The skull of St. Peter. It was stolen from a nunnery, my parish, eight days ago. They asked me to get it back.

SAM

Really?

FATHER LUCCA

Our local police can’t handle something like this, and the sisters, they have faith in me.

DEAN

How’s that working out for ‘em?

[SAM is searching on his phone while he looks at the wallet.]

SAM

So, what? You just thought you’d uh… come here and steal it back?

FATHER LUCCA

No. I was gonna buy it. Thieves only understand one thing – money – so I-I-I brought money. All the money that we had.

[DEAN picks up the briefcase. He opens it to see a lot money in different currencies.]

FATHER LUCCA

My village is a small place, and Miele… when he vanished after the skull went missing, we all knew what he’d done. So, I followed him here.

DEAN

And killed him.

FATHER LUCCA

No, mio Dio (my God). No, I would never do that. When I arrived, he was already dead. I… and I didn’t know what to do.

SAM

So you hit me?

FATHER LUCCA

The skull was gone. When I saw you found something, I-I-I lost my head, okay? Look, that relic means everything to my congregation. And I understand that sounds strange to you, but… Imagine you woke up one morning, and this thing you loved, this thing you and your parents and your children saw every week, this thing you prayed to since you were old enough to form words, was just gone. What would you do?

SAM

Try to get it back.

FATHER LUCCA

And I did. And I failed. And – and this never should’ve happened.

DEAN

Yeah, well, the world’s a screwed place, padre. What are you gonna do about it?

FATHER LUCCA

Change it.

DEAN

Yeah, good luck with that.

FATHER LUCCA

It’s not about luck, son. It’s about effort. All the time, I hear people saying the world’s not perfect. And they’re right. It’s not. But do you use that as an excuse? Do you use it to excuse your own sins? Your failings and your laziness? Do you use it to give a bad man power, because the world’s not perfect? Or do you work? Do you try and improve things in whatever way you can? Guys, the world will never be perfect, but if good men do good things, it can be better. Every day can get better.

[SAM smiles as he listens.]

FATHER LUCCA

I-I’m sorry, I know I talk too much. I just… I just wanna go home.

DEAN

Without the skull?

FATHER LUCCA

Yes.

SAM

No. What if we get the skull back for you?

DEAN

Sam – excuse me. Can I talk to you?

[SAM and DEAN get up and walk away.]

SAM

What?

DEAN

The hell are you doin’?

SAM

We have to find it anyways.

DEAN

Yeah, and give it to Greenstreet and then get our fill up on Jesus juice.

SAM

Or we get the skull back and then we arrange a meet and then…

DEAN

What? Double-cross him?

SAM

Why not?

[DEAN scoffs as SAM takes out his phone.]

SAM

Okay, look. Look at this. Father Lucca Camilleri, born in Malta. He spent the last two decades of his life doing charity work all over the world – Africa, South America. He – he – he’s a good guy. And what he said… I believe him.

DEAN

Great. So do I. But Friar Tuck over there, we don’t owe him anything. Sammy, he sucker-punched you.

SAM

And I get why. I mean, if-if somebody, uh, if somebody stole the Impala, what would you do?

DEAN

Murder. I’d murder ‘em all.

SAM

Right. My point being, I… I don’t want a dick like Greenstreet or Scarpatti to win. Not this time.

DEAN

There’ll be torture first. There’ll be, like, a lot of torture, and then there’d – it would end up with death. If I can’t have it, nobody can.

SAM

Were you even listening to what I was saying? Scarpatti and Greenstreet? What did I say?

[DEAN is staring angrily at SAM. SAM waves his hands in front of DEAN, but he isn’t moving. SAM walks away, as DEAN snaps out of it and follows him.]

EXTERIOR – HIGHWAY – NIGHT

[The Impala drives down the road.]

INTERIOR – THE IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN

Alright. It’s a party. The guy who jumped you – you remember anything about him?

[FATHER LUCCA is sitting in the backseat.]

FATHER LUCCA

No. I-I’m sorry.

DEAN

Okay, what about security cameras?

SAM

Nope. There aren’t any.

DEAN

Great. So we got nothing.

FATHER LUCCA

Wait. We got the number on the paper.

DEAN

The what?

FATHER LUCCA

SE-143382-IT99.

DEAN

Wow. That’s some memory. Okay, well, what is it? A combination? Coordinates, maybe?

[SAM starts to look up the number on his laptop.]

SAM

No, no, no. It is, uh… it’s a tracking number… for a package sent from Valletta, Malta, five days ago.

FATHER LUCCA

Where is it now?

INTERIOR – EXPRESS COURIERS – NIGHT

[A man rings the bell at the counter. A COURIER comes in from the back room.]

COURIER

Can I help you?

FAKE COP

You can say that.

[It is the FAKE COP from the hotel room. He hands over the piece of paper with the tracking number to the COURIER.]

EXTERIOR – STREET – NIGHT

[SAM, DEAN and FATHER LUCCA watch from the Impala as the fake cop leaves the Express Couriers with the package. He gets in his car and drives away.]

DEAN

There he is.

SAM

That’s fake cop.

DEAN

Yes, it is.

[DEAN pulls the Impala out of parking and starts to follow the other car.]

EXTERIOR – SEATTLE – NIGHT

[A shot of the Speed Needle in the distance.]

EXTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[The FAKE COP’s car pulls into a warehouse lot. The Impala pulls up outside.]

FATHER LUCCA

Why did he bring the relic here?

DEAN

Don’t know. Don’t care. Alright, here’s the play – we head in there and we kick fake cop’s real ass.

SAM

Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look at this.

[They all look out the window to see another car pulling into the lot.]

DEAN

What the hell?

[A man gets out of the driver’s side and walks to the back of the car. MARGARET exits the car.]

DEAN
Oh, look, it’s your girlfriend.

SAM

So much for simple.

INTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[MARGARET enters the warehouse as the FAKE COP follows her in, carrying the package.]

MARGARET

Everything’s on schedule?

FAKE COP

Yes, ma’am, even with all the complications.

MARGARET

Complications are what I pay you for.

FAKE COP

Maybe we should talk about a raise.

MARGARET

No. We really shouldn’t. Mr. Scarpatti, thank you so much for coming.

[MARGARET walks further into the warehouse, where SCARPATTI and his men are standing around a table.]

SCARPATTI

What can I say? When somebody’s screwing me, I like to look into their eye.

MARGARET

No one’s screwing–

SCARPATTI

Really? If it wasn’t for me, that wouldn’t even be here. Alright? I already made a deal.

MARGARET

With a dead man.

SCARPATTI

Well, he wasn’t dead at the time.

MARGARET

Times change. Mr. Miele was the competition, so…

SCARPATTI

Yeah, so… you killed him?

MARGARET

I cornered the market.

SCARPATTI

Really? So I, uh, I suppose you don’t plan on, um, honoring his price.

MARGARET

Oh.

SCARPATTI

So what if I say no?

MARGARET

Oh, if you won’t pay, he will.

SCARPATTI

Who’s “he”?

[GREENSTREET walks into the warehouse with his men.]

SCARPATTI

Huh. You know the deal’s crap when we start drawing flies.

GREENSTREET

If that’s what you think, there is the door.

SCARPATTI

Yeah, well, fat chance.

MARGARET

Now then… shall we begin?

[FAKE COP opens the package with a knife. He takes out a bag and places it on the table. He opens the bag to reveal the skull of St. Peter.]

EXTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[DEAN is sitting in the Impala, FATHER LUCCA is now in the passenger seat, as SAM is in the warehouse.]

FATHER LUCCA

You’re worried.

DEAN

You’re not?

FATHER LUCCA

I… God will see us through.

DEAN

Yeah, he really won’t.

FATHER LUCCA

You’re not a believer.

DEAN

Oh, I believe. Hell, I know. God? He doesn’t give a damn about you or me or anyone else. So, if you’re expecting some sort of a-a miracle to happen, well… good luck.

FATHER LUCCA

I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that God would reach down and protect us. Of course, that’s not going to happen. But I believe that all good things are God’s things. And what your brother’s doing, it’s a good thing.

DEAN

Yeah, or a stupid thing.

FATHER LUCCA

Or both. Many times, they can be the same.

[SAM’s voice is heard on DEAN’s phone.]

INTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

SAM

Yeah, I got it. I got it. Just go easy.

[A man leads SAM into the warehouse. FAKE COP takes out his gun and aims it at SAM.]

SAM

Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy. Easy. I’m not here to fight.

FAKE COP

Then why are you here?

[SAM holds up the briefcase he is carrying, and FAKE COP takes aim at him.]

SAM

Just… may I?

[SAM opens the case to show them the money inside.]

SAM

I’m here to buy. So… let’s make a deal. Okay? It’s just business.

EXTERIOR – WARHOUSE – NIGHT

[DEAN picks up his phone as SAM continues.]

DEAN

He’s in. Let’s go.

[DEAN and FATHER LUCCA leave the Impala.]

ACT FOUR


[SAM drops the case on the table.]

MARGARET

Sam! So very, very good to see you again.

[SAM gives her a fake smile.]

GREENSTREET

I’m sorry. I thought you were working for me.

SCARPATTI

And I thought you were working for me.

SAM

Right, yeah. Turns out I’m working for me.

GREENSTREET

I don’t trust him.

MARGARET

Oh, I don’t know. I’m quite fond of Sam. And besides, money’s money. Hmm?

[She takes out a notepad from her bag and rips a piece of paper out. She hands it to SAM along with a pen.]

EXTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[A henchman is keeping guard. FATHER LUCCA approaches behind him.]

FATHER LUCCA

Pardon me.

HENCHMAN

The hell are you doing here?

FATHER LUCCA

Creating a distraction.

[DEAN comes up behind the henchman and covers his mouth. He takes his gun, as he puts him in a headlock, and starts dropping him to the ground.]

DEAN

“Creating a distraction”?

FATHER LUCCA

Lying, it’s a sin.

[DEAN drops the henchman to the ground who is passed out. He checks the gun for bullets as FATHER LUCCA looks at the henchman on the ground.]

FATHER LUCCA

Is he okay?

[DEAN looks at FATHER LUCCA, before walking away.]

INTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[MARGARET is standing at the table where the skull sits.]

MARGARET

Alright. I wanna make this simple. I want each of you to think of your price, your very best price, and write it down on a piece of paper. The one with the most zeroes wins. Agreed?

SCARPATTI

Yeah, whatever.

SAM

What he said.

[SAM looks down the paper in his hands.]

EXTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[More henchmen are passed out.]

DEAN

Alright, that’s all of ‘em.

FATHER LUCCA

What now?

[DEAN cocks the gun.]

DEAN

You stay here and you stay down.

FATHER LUCCA

I’ll say a prayer.

DEAN

Yeah. You do that.

[DEAN leaves to go into the warehouse.]

INTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[SAM, SCARPATTI and GREENSTREET are all writing down their price. MARGARET walks to SCARPATTI’s henchman and takes the paper. She then walks to GREENSTREET and takes his. She walks to SAM, as he finishes writing his price down. He shuts the case, and hands her his paper.]

MARGARET

[to SAM] Good luck.

[MARGARET hands the papers to FAKE COP.]

MARGARET

If you would.

FAKE COP

Sure. From Lurch [he points at SAM] over here, $634,000… and 2 cents.

[SCARPATTI laughs.]

SCARPATTI

2 cents.

FAKE COP

[to SCARPATTI] from the boss, $3 million.

GREENSTREET

Yeah, well, you tried. That’s the most important part.

SCARPATTI

Really?

FAKE COP

[to GREENSTREET] and from Fats over there… nothing.

[FAKE COP holds up the paper which has a ‘0’ on it.]

SAM

What?

SCARPATTI

Nothing?

MARGARET

Is this a joke to you?

GREENSTREET

Oh no. I intend to buy the skull… just not from you. Kill her.

[FAKE COP takes out his gun and aims it at MARGARET.]

SAM

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.

GREENSTREET

Hand me the relic, and I will pay you $1 million cash right now.

MARGARET

Mr. Cromarty has been working for me for years, and I can assure you–

[FAKE COP/MR. CROMARTY shots MARGARET. She falls to the floor, dead.]

FAKE COP/MR. CROMARTY

Really should’ve talked about that raise.

[SAM moves out of the way as FAKE COP/MR. CROMARTY starts shooting at the henchmen. GREENSTREET and his man hide behind some equipment, as a shoot-out starts. SAM starts shooting at the others, as they all start shooting at each other. DEAN enters the warehouse, and starts shooting at the henchmen.]

EXTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[FATHER LUCCA hears what is happening inside and continues to pray.]

INTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[The shoot-out continues, and moves into a montage. SCARPATTI and his man are shooting at GREENSTREET’s man, and he shoots at them. SAM and DEAN are shooting at the henchmen. DEAN takes both guns and moves forward, as he continues to fire. Outside, FATHER LUCCA continues to pray. Inside, FAKE COP/MR. CROMARTY shoots SCARPATTI, and he falls to the floor, dead. One of the men shoots FAKE COP/MR. CROMARTY. SAM shoots one of the henchman. FATHER LUCCA is now inside, and stops FAKE COP/MR. CROMARTY from shooting DEAN. They struggle, and FAKE COP/MR. CROMARTY shoots FATHER LUCCA.]

SAM

No!

[SAM shoots FAKE COP/MR. CROMARTY and he falls to the floor. SAM and DEAN rush over to FATHER LUCCA.]

SAM

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You alright?

FATHER LUCCA

I think I got shot.

[DEAN lifts up FATHER LUCCA’s shirt to see only a little blood.]

DEAN

Looks like he just grazed you. A few more inches to the left and, uh…

FATHER LUCCA

It’s a miracle.

[SAM and DEAN, with FATHER LUCCA behind them, search the warehouse and find GREENSTREET still hiding.]

GREENSTREET

I didn’t know this would happen. I… I’ll give you anything you want, huh?

DEAN

The blood, where is it?

GREENSTREET

It, uh… doesn’t exist.

SAM

You… what? Wait a second. You told us–

GREENSTREET

Exactly what you wanted to hear. It was just a bit of…

DEAN

Chicanery?

GREENSTREET

Exactly.

DEAN

Well… chicane this.

[DEAN punches GREENSTREET to the ground.]

ACT FIVE


EXTERIOR – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

[There are police cars outside the warehouse. A policeman leads GREENSTREET to a car and sits him inside.]

GREENSTREET

No, no, no, no. Wait. Don’t – you – you – you’ve made a mistake.

EXTERIOR – AIRPORT – DAY

[SAM and DEAN stand in front of FATHER LUCCA.]

SAM

Are you sure you’re going to be okay?

FATHER LUCCA

I am. Grazie mille. Thank you for everything.

DEAN

You know it’s just a hunk of bone, right?

FATHER LUCCA

I do, but everyone, we all have faith in something, even if it’s just “a hunk of bone.”

SAM

By the way, I-I-I was reading about you. Um, what is, uh… Apostolic Protonotary Supernumery?

DEAN

A what now?

FATHER LUCCA

Oh. It-it doesn’t mean anything. It’s just a title the Pope gives for good works.

DEAN

The Pope gave that to you? What – you met the Pope?

FATHER LUCCA

Yeah. He called me un uomo santissimo.

SAM

What does that mean?

FATHER LUCCA

“A most holy man.”

[SAM and DEAN look shocked, before they look at each other.]

FATHER LUCCA

What?

DEAN

Before you go, we’re gonna need one more thing.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, WAR ROOM – DAY

[DEAN is sitting at the world map table, while holding a vile of FATHER LUCCA’s blood. SAM walks into the room.]

DEAN

Well, one down, three to go.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

What?

[SAM sits down on the stairs between the war room and the library, as DEAN turns to face him.]

DEAN

Come on. I know that look. What’s on your mind?

SAM

I don’t know. Nothing. I mean – I mean, you know… You ever feel like we’re – we’re doing nothing but playing defense? You know, bouncing from one apocalypse to the next?

DEAN

Well, it’s not exactly our call.

SAM

I know that, and I’m not saying we don’t do good. But – but no matter how many people we save, there will always be more people that need saving. No matter how many monsters we kill–

DEAN

There’s always gonna be another one around the corner.

SAM

Exactly.

[DEAN nods as he takes in what SAM is saying.]

SAM

You think we could ever change things? I mean, really change things? You know, stop all the monsters, all the bad?

DEAN

That would be nice.

SAM

Yeah. So, what are you thinkin’? Think that’ll work?

[DEAN moves the vile around, and looks at SAM.]

DEAN

I have faith.
