TEASER
SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.

A man drives down the street, into his garage and turns off the engine. A close up of the Michigan number plate. The garage door starts winding down by itself and he looks at it, confused. His car doors then self lock. He struggles but cannot open them. The ignition key turns by itself and the engine starts. Exhaust smoke begins filling the garage. The man struggles to turn off the engine to no avail. The radio flicks on. The man begins to cough.

MAN
Help. Somebody help me!

By now the smoke is very thick and he keels over, unconscious.

ACT ONE
INTERIOR. NIGHT. MOTEL ROOM.

SAM starts up from his bed, suddenly wide awake. He looks across to where DEAN is sleeping peacefully. SAM sits a moment, then moves into action, flipping on the light switch and shaking his brother.

SAM
Dean. Dean.

The moment DEAN stirs, SAM rises and starts gathering his things.

DEAN
(rubbing his eyes) What are you doing man, it's the middle of the night.

DEAN raises himself on his elbows.

SAM
We have to go.

DEAN
(Immediately alert but not alarmed) What's happening?

SAM
We have to go. Right now.

SAM grabs his bag and walks out.

.....................

INTERIOR OF IMPALA. NIGHT.

DEAN is driving, SAM is on the phone.

SAM
(reading from a Michigan State Police ID) McReady. Detective McReady. Badge number 158. I've got a signal 480 in progress, I need the registered owner of a two door sedan, Michigan licence plate Mary-Frank-six-zero-three-seven. Yeah ok, just hurry.

DEAN
Sammy relax. I'm sure it's just a nightmare.

SAM
Yeah, tell me about it.

DEAN
I mean it. Y'know, a normal, everyday, naked-in-class, nightmare. This licence plate, it won't check out. You'll see.

SAM
It felt different Dean. Real. Like when I dreamt about our old house. And Jessica.

DEAN
Yeah, that makes sense. You're dreaming about our house, your girlfriend. This guy in your dream, you ever seen him before?

SAM
No.

DEAN
No. Exactly. Why would you have premonitions about some random dude in Michigan.

SAM
I don't know.

DEAN
Me neither.

SAM
(into phone) Yes I'm here.

He listens, glares at DEAN, then picks up his pen.

SAM
Jim Miller. Saginaw, Michigan. You have a street address? Got it. Thanks.

SAM
(hanging up phone) Checks out. How far are we?

DEAN
From Saginaw? Coupla hours.

SAM
Drive faster.

............................

EXTERIOR. NIGHT. JIM MILLER'S HOUSE.

The Impala cruises to a stop, the boys see the Emergency vehicles and someone on a stretcher being zipped into a body bag. They turn to each other in the car, DEAN concerned, SAM upset.

............................

TITLE CARD: SUPERNATURAL

...........................

EXTERIOR. JIM'S HOUSE.

DEAN approaches the watching crowd.

DEAN
(To a woman) What happened?

WOMAN
http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/index.php?title=1.14_Nightmare_(transcript)&action=edit Suicide. Can't believe it

SAM
(Coming up behind and standing on the woman's other side) Did you know them?

WOMAN
Saw him in every Sunday at St Augustines. He always seems...seemed, so normal. I guess you never know what's going on behind closed doors.

DEAN
(Staring straight ahead) Guess not.

SAM
How did...ahh. How are they saying it happened?

WOMAN
I heard they found him in the garage, locked inside his car with the engine running.

SAM
Do you know about what time they found him?

WOMAN
Oh it just happened about an hour or two ago. His poor family. I can't even imagine what they're going through.

A woman stands on the front step of the house, crying and leaning against a middle aged man. A young man stands behind them, looking distraught.

SAM watches, grimacing, them turns to walk away. DEAN notices and follows him back to lean against the Impala's bonnet.

DEAN
Sam we got here as fast we we could.

SAM
Not fast enough. It doesn't make any sense man. Why would I even have these premonitions if there wasn't a chance I could stop them from happening?

DEAN
I dunno.

SAM
(Shaking his head and sighing). So what do you think killed him?

DEAN
Maybe the guy just killed himself? Maybe there's nothing supernatural going on at all.

SAM
(shaking his head) I'm telling you, I watched it happen. He was murdered by something Dean. I watched it trap him in the garage.

DEAN
What was it, a spirit, poltergeist, what?

SAM
(getting a little worked up) I don't know what it was. I don't know why I'm having these dreams, I don't know what the hell is happening Dean.

DEAN stares at SAM for a long moment.

SAM
What.

DEAN
(Shrugging). Nothing. I'm just, I'm worried about you man.

SAM
Well, don't look at me like that!

DEAN
(Looking away) I'm not looking at you like anything.

DEAN
(Glancing back) Though I gotta say, you do look like crap.

SAM
Nice. Thanks.

DEAN
(moving to open the car door) Come on, lets just pick this up in the morning. We'll check out the house, talk to the family.

SAM
Dean, you saw them, they're devastated They're not going to want to talk to us.

DEAN
(Thinking) Yeah you're right. But I think I know who they will talk to.

SAM
Who?

DEAN smirks

..............................

EXTERIOR. DAY. MILLER HOUSE
DEAN'S hand (wearing his silver ring) reaches out to a doorbell. Cut to close up of SAM's face, his hair slicked back neatly.

SAM
(Sighing) This has gotta be a whole new low for us.

DEAN turns to smirk at SAM, then looks back at the door.

The Man comforting MS MILLER on the step the night before opens the door. We see SAM and DEAN are dressed as priests in black suits.

DEAN
Good Afternoon. I'm Father Simmons, this is Father Frehley.Pseudonyms We're new junior priests over at St Augustines. May we come in?

The man nods.

DEAN
(Entering) Thanks.

SAM
We're very sorry for your loss.

DEAN
It's in difficult times like these when the Lord's guidance is most needed.

MAN
Look, you wanna pitch your whole 'Lord has a plan' thing? Fine. Just don't pitch it to me. My brother's dead.

MS MILLER appears.

MS MILLER
Roger. Please!

ROGER
(Moving away) Excuse me.

MS MILLER
I'm sorry about my brother in law. He's...he's just so upset about Jim's death. Would you like some coffee?

DEAN
That would be great.

...........................

INTERIOR. LOUNGE ROOM.

DEAN is on the lounge, SAM in an armchair. MS MILLER pours coffee and hands it around.

MS MILLER
It was wonderful of you to stop by. The support of the church means so much right now.

DEAN
Of course. After all we are all God's children.

She walks away and DEAN immediately takes more cocktail sausages from the coffee table. Chewing contentedly, he looks at SAM shaking his head.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Just...tone it down a little bit, Father.

MS MILLER returns.

DEAN
So Ms Miller, did you husband have a history of depression?

MS MILLER
Nothing like that. (Beginning to be upset) We had our ups and downs like everyone but we were happy. (Breaking down) I just don't understand...how Jim could do something like this.

SAM
I'm so sorry you had to find him like that.

MS MILLER
(Gesturing behind her) Actually, our son Max, he was the one who found him.

SAM looks through the doors into the dining room and sees MAX sitting in the corner, staring into space.

SAM
Do you mind if maybe, I go talk to him?

MS MILLER
Oh thank you Father.

............................

SAM approaches MAX in the other room.

SAM
Max? Hey, I'm Sam.

...........................

DEAN
Ms Miller you have a lovely home. How long have you lived here?

MS MILLER
We moved in about five years ago.

DEAN
The only problem with these old houses. I bet you have all kind of headaches.

MS MILLER
Like what?

DEAN
Well, weird leaks, electrical shortages, odd settling noises at night. That kind of thing.

MS MILLER
No, nothing like that. It's been perfect.

DEAN
Huh. May I use your restroom.

MS MILLER
Oh sure, it's just up the stairs.

DEAN rises, taking another cocktail sausage.

.........................

SAM
So what was your Dad like?

MAX
Just a normal Dad.

SAM
Yeah. You live at home now?

MAX
Yeah. Trying to save up for school but it's hard.

SAM
So when you found your dad...

MAX
I woke up, I heard the engine running. (long pause) I don't know why he did it.

SAM
I know it's rough, losing a parent. Especially when you don't have all the answers.
...................

INTERIOR. UPSTAIRS.

DEAN enters the hallway. Checking the coast is clear, he pulls an infer-red thermal scanner from his pocket and turns it on, shining it into rooms as he passes. As he reaches the end of the hall he hears footsteps coming up the stairs and hastily hides the scanner. SAM appears.

SAM
Anything?

DEAN
Zip.

They move back down the stairs together.

.....................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

DEAN is cleaning his weapons, SAM enters.

DEAN
What do you have?

SAM
A whole lotta nothing. Nothing bad has happened in the Miller house since it was built.

DEAN
What about the land?

SAM
(sinking onto his bed) No grave yards, battle fields, tribal lands or any other kind of atrocity on or near the property.

DEAN
Hey man I told you, I searched that house up and down. No cold spots, sulfer scent. Nada.

SAM
And the family said everything was normal?

DEAN
Well, if there was a demon or poltergiest in there you think somebody would have noticed something? I used the infer-red thermal scanner man, and there was nothing.

SAM
So what, you think Jim Miller killed himself and my dream was just some sorta freakish coincidence??

DEAN
I dunno. I'm pretty sure there's nothing supernatural about that house.

SAM
(rubbing his temples) Yeah. Well, maybe it has nothing to do with the house. (he takes a deep breath, holding his head). Maybe it's just...Gosh (holding his hand to his forehead)... maybe it's connected to Jim in some other way?

DEAN
What's wrong with you?

SAM
(making anguished noises and sinking from the bed to crouch on the floor) Ahh. My head.

DEAN
(leaving his bed) Sam? Hey, (He crouches and grabs SAM's arms.) Hey! What's going on? Talk to me.

SAM stares at DEAN. Suddenly SAM flashes out of the motel room and is a fly on the wall, watching ROGER enter his kitchen with groceries. He notices the window is open and closes and locks it. When he returns to unpacking the lock moves by itself and the window slides open again. Roger is confused. He attempts to close it but it sticks. He leans out, twisting to look up at the top of the window. The window slides closed, decapitating him. Blood gushes up over the window.

SAM focuses back to DEAN in the motel room.

SAM
It's happening again. Something's gunna kill Roger Miller.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXTERIOR. IMPALA.

DEAN is driving.

SAM
(slowly into his phone, holding his head) Roger Miller. Ah no no,just the address please. Ok, thanks

SAM
(to DEAN) 450 West Grove, Apartment 1120.

DEAN
You ok?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
If you're gunna hurl I'll pull the car over you know, cause the upholstery...

SAM
I'm fine.

DEAN
All right.

SAM
Just drive.

SAM looks at DEAN, sighes heavily, and looks away.

SAM
Dean I'm scared man. These nightmares weren't bad enough, now I'm seeing things when I'm awake? And these, visions, or whatever, they're getting more intense. And painful.

DEAN
Come on man, you'll be all right. It'll be fine.

SAM
What is it about the Millers. Why am I connected to them, why am I watching them die? Why the hell is this happening to me?

DEAN
I don't know Sam but we'll figure it out. We've faced the unexplainable every day. This is just another thing.

SAM
No. It's never been us. It's never been in the family like this. Tell the truth, you can't tell me this doesn't freak you out.

DEAN
(After staring straight ahead for a long moment) This doesnt freak me out.

SAM stares at him, then turns away.

......................

EXTERIOR. ROGER MILLER'S APARTMENT BLOCK.

The Impala pulls up as Roger approaches the entrance with a bag of groceries.

SAM
(out the window) Hey Roger.

ROGER
What are you guys, missionaries? Leave me alone.

SAM
Please!

But Roger is gone. DEAN guns the engine, jumping the curb as he hurriedly parks.

SAM
(Getting out and running) Hey. Roger. We're trying to help!

SAM
Please! Hey, hey hey hey hey.

SAM runs up to the entrance just as ROGER closes the door it behind him.

ROGER
I don't want your help.

ROGER walks away.

SAM
(Calling after him) We're not priests, you gotta listen to us!

DEAN
Roger, you're in danger!

DEAN
(Looking around) Come on. Come on come on.

SAM and DEAN run around the corner to a back entrance, it is securely locked. DEAN quickly looks around then kicks it open. They jump to the first level of the fire escape then run up the stairs. When they are one floor from ROGER'S house, they hear the window slide down and a wet squelching noise. SAM freezes, DEAN sprints past him and grabs the railing. ROGER's head lies in the flower bed under the window, his blood all over the kitchen window. SAM joins him. After a long pause he pulls material (hankerchief?) from his pocket, throwing one to SAM and starting to wipe down the railing.

DEAN
Start wiping down yout fingerprints, we don't want the cops to know we were here. Come on, come on!

DEAN
(Using his rag to push up the window leading out to the fire escape) I'm gunna take a look inside.

SAM continues wiping down the metal railing.

.....................

DEAN
I'm telling you there was nothing in there. No signs either, just like the Miller's house.

SAM
I saw something, in the vision. Like a dark shape. Something was....something was stalking Roger.

DEAN
Whatever it was, are you sure it's not connected to their house?

SAM
No, it's connected to the family themselves. So what do you think, like a vengeful spirit?

DEAN
Well yeah, there's a few that have been known to latch onto families, follow them for years.

SAM
Angiak. Banshees.

DEAN
Basically like a curse. So maybe Roger and Jim Miller got involved in something heavy, something curse worthy.

SAM
And now the something is out for revenge. And the men in their family are dying.

SAM
Hey you think Max is in Danger?

DEAN
Let's figure it our before he is.

SAM
Well, I know one thing I have in common with these people.

DEAN
What's that?

SAM
Both our families are cursed.

DEAN
(Huffing)Our family's not cursed! We just...had our dark spots.

SAM
Our dark spots are...pretty dark.

DEAN
You're....dark.

.........................

INTERIOR. THE MILLER HOUSE.

Max leads SAM and DEAN in. They are wearing their priests outfits.

MAX
My Mom's resting, she's pretty wrecked.

DEAN
Of course.

MAX
All these people kept coming with like, casseroles? I finally had to tell them all to go away. You know cause nothing says I'm sorry like a tuna casserole.

SAM smiles. Max smiles back.

Max gestures to the lounge and they all take seats. There is a moments silence, then SAM sighs.

SAM
(Softly) How you holding up?

MAX
Ok.

SAM
You're dad and your uncle were close.

MAX
Yeah I guess. I mean, they were brothers. They used to hang out all the time when I was little.

SAM
But not lately much?

MAX
No, it's not that. It's just....we used to be neighbours when I was a kid, and we lived across town in this house. Uncle Roger lived next door, so he was over all the time.

SAM
Right. So how was it in that house when you were a kid?

MAX
It was fine. Why?

DEAN
All good memories? Do you remember anything unusual? Something involving your father and your uncle maybe?

Max
(shaking his head) What do ya....why do you ask?

DEAN
Just a question.

MAX
No, there was nothing. We were totally normal. Happy.

DEAN
Good. That's good. Well you must be exhausted. We should take off.

SAM
Right. (To Max) Thanks.

MAX
Yeah.

.......................

EXTERIOR. MILLER HOUSE.

SAM and DEAN walk down the drive to stand beside the Impala.

DEAN
No one's family is totally normal and happy. See when he was talking about his old house?

SAM
He sounded scared.

DEAN
Yeah Max isn't telling us everything. I say we go find the old neighbourhood, find out what life was really like for the Millers.

..........................

EXTERIOR. ANOTHER SUBURB.

SAM and DEAN stand on the footpath, talking to a man in his front yard.

SAM
Have you lived in the neighbourhood very long?

MAN
Yeah, almost 20 years now. It's nice and quiet. Why, you looking to buy?

SAM
No, no, actually, we were wondering if you might recall a family that used to live right across the street I believe.

DEAN
Yeah the Millers. They had a little boy called Max.

SAM
Right.

MAN
Yeah I remember. The brother had the place next door. So uh, what's this about, is that poor kid ok?

SAM
What do you mean?

MAN
Well in my life I've never seen a child treated like that. I mean I'd hear Mr Miller yelling and throwing things clear across the street, he was a mean drunk. He used to beat the tar outta Max. Bruises. Broke his arm two times that I know of.

SAM
This was going on regularly?

MAN
Practically every day. In fact that thug brother of his was just as likely to take a swing at the boy but the worst part was the stepmother. She'd just stand there, checked out, not lifting a finger to protect him. I must have called the police seven or eight times. Never did any good.

DEAN
Now you said step-mother.

MAN
I think his real mother died. Some sorta...accident. Car accident I think.

SAM has his hand to his head and is grimacing.

MAN
Are you ok there?

SAM
(wincing) uh, yeah.

DEAN
(holding an arm out toward SAM) Thanks for your time.

SAM
(lifting his hands to his head) Yeah, thank you.

They turn to go, DEAN supporting SAM.

SAM
God.

SAM looks up and the words spins. He is suddenly in the Miller's kitchen. Ms Miller is chopping vegetable with a large knife.

MS MILLER
(Laying the knife down) I don't know what you mean by that. You know I never did anything!

Max
That's right. You didn't do anything. (the knife starts to rattle on the chopping board) You didn't stop them, not once. (The knife lifts into the air)

MS MILLER
(backing up against the wall) How did you...

The knife moves forward to hold her against the wall.

MS MILLER
Max! please!

The knife twists in front of her face, coming close enough to her eyeball to pierce the tear there so it runs down her cheek. She gasps.

MAX
(with tears in his voice) For every time you stood there and watched. Pretending it wasn't happening.

MS MILLER
I'm sorry.

MAX
No you're not. You just don't wanna die.

MS MILLER gasps and cries. The knife slices right through her eye and out the back of her head.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INTERIOR. IMPALA.

SAM
Max is doing it. Everything I've been seeing

DEAN
You sure about this?

SAM
Yeah, I saw him.

DEAN
How's he pulling it off?

SAM
I don't know, like telekinesis?

DEAN
What so he's psychic, a spoon bender?

SAM
I didn't even realize it but this whole time, he was there. He was outside the garage when his Dad died, he was in the apartment when his Uncle died. These visions, this whole time -- I wasn't connecting to the Millers, I was connecting to Max! The thing is I don't get why, man. I guess -- because we're so alike?

DEAN
What are you talking about. The dude's nothing like you.

SAM
Well. We both have psychic abilities, we both...

DEAN
Both what? Sam, Max is a monster, he's already killed two people, now he's gunning for a third.

SAM
Well, with what he went through, the beatings, to want revenge on those people? I'm sorry, man, I hate to say it, but it's not that insane.

DEAN
Yeah but it doesn't justify murdering your entire family!

SAM
Dean...

DEAN
(Pulling over at Max's house) He's no different from anything else we've hunted, all right? We gotta end him.

SAM
We're not going to kill Max.

DEAN

Then what? Hand him over to the cops and say 'Lock him up officer; he kills with the power of his mind.'

SAM
No way. Forget it.

DEAN
(Turning off the engine) Sam...

SAM
Dean. He's a person. We can talk to him. Hey, promise me you'll follow my lead on this one.

DEAN
(After a long pause) All right fine. But I'm not letting him hurt anybody else.

DEAN removes his Taurus pistol from the glove compartment, glaring at SAM and opening the door.

.........................

INTERIOR. KITCHEN.

Repeat of earlier scene.

MS MILLER
You know I never did anything.

MAX
That's right. You didn't do anything. You didn't stop them, not once!

SAM and DEAN burst through the front door.

MS MILLER
Fathers?

MAX
What are you doing here?

DEAN
Aahh, sorry to interrupt.

SAM
Max, can we, uh, can we talk to you outside for just one second?

MAX
(Suspicious) About what?

SAM
It's....it's private. I wouldn't want to bother your mother with it.

SAM
(To MS MILLER) We won't be long at all though, I promise.

MAX
(looking at his stepmother, then back) Ok.

SAM
Great.

DEAN and SAM turn for the door, MAX follows. As DEAN grasps the doorknob he turns back to smile at MAX. MAX sees the butt of the pistol in DEAN'S waistband in the hall mirror. Suddenly the knob is pulled from DEAN'S hand and the door slams shut, as does the wooden window blinds all around the room.

MAX
(backing up) You're not priests!

DEAN draws his gun but MAX uses his power to pull it away, sliding it across the floor to where he can pick it up. He hold's it on SAM and DEAN.

MS MILLER
Max, what's happening?

MAX
Shut up.

MS MILLER
What are you doing?

Using his power, MAX flings MS MILLER backwards. She hits her head on the kitchen bench and falls to the ground unconscious.

MAX
I said shut up!

SAM
Max calm down.

MAX
Who are you?

SAM
We just wanna talk.

MAX
Yeah right, that's why you bought this! (Indicating the gun)

SAM
That was a mistake all right? So was lying about who we were. But no more lying Max ok? Just please, just hear me out.

MAX
About what?

SAM
I saw you do it. I saw you kill your Dad and your Uncle before it happened.

MAX
What?

SAM
I'm having visions Max. About you.

MAX
You're crazy.

SAM
So what, you weren't gonna launch a knife at your stepmom? (SAM taps his eye) Right here? Is it that hard to believe Max, look what you can do. Max I was drawn here all right? I think I'm here to help you.

MAX
(crying) No one can help me.

SAM
Let me try. We'll just talk, me and you. We'll get Dean and Alice out of here.

DEAN
Uh-huh. No way.

SAM and DEAN look up as the chandelier begins to shake.

MAX
Nobody leaves this house!

SAM
And nobody has to, all right? They'll just...they'll just go upstairs.

DEAN
Sam I'm not leaving you alone with him.

SAM
Yes you are. Look, Max. You're in charge here, all right, we all know that. No one's going to do anything that you don't want to do but I'm talking five minutes here man.

DEAN
Sam!

MAX
(looking back at his stepmother) Five minutes? (the chandelier stops shaking) Go.

DEAN moves to pick up MS MILLER

........................

INTERIOR. MILLER HOUSE. LOUNGE.

SAM and MAX sit in the lounge. MAX stares at a letter opener and it raises on its point and begins twirling slowly.

SAM
Look, I can't begin to understand what you went through.

MAX
That's right you can't.

SAM
Max, this has to stop.

MAX
It will, after my stepmother --

SAM
No. You need to let her go.

MAX
Why?

SAM
Did she beat you?

MAX
No, but she never tried to save me. She's a part of it too.

SAM
What they did, to you, what they all did to you growing up, they deserve to be punished...

MAX
Growing up? Try last week.

MAX gets up and lifts his shirt. His chest and side are a mass of bruises.

MAX
My dad still hit me. Just in places people wouldn't see it. Old habits die hard I guess.

SAM
(softly) I'm sorry.

MAX
When I first found out I could move things it was a gift. My whole life I was helpless but now I had this. So last week Dad gets drunk. The first time in a long time. And he beats me to hell, first time in a long time. And then I knew what I had to do.

SAM
Why didn't you just leave?

MAX
It wasn't about getting away. Just knowing they would still be out there. It was about...not being afraid. When my Dad used to look at me, there was hate in his eyes. Do you know what that feels like?

SAM
No.

MAX
He blamed me for everything. For his job, for his life, for my Mom's death.

SAM
Why would he blame you for your Mom's death?

MAX
Because she died in my nursery, while I was asleep in my crib. As if that makes it my fault.

SAM
(Looking shocked) She died in your nursery?

MAX
There was a fire. And he'd get drunk and babble on like she died in some insane way. He said that she burned up. Pinned to the ceiling!

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INERIOR. MILLER HOUSE. LOUNGE.

SAM
(In shock) Listen to me Max. What your Dad said, about what happened to your Mom. It's real.

MAX
What?

SAM
It happened to my Mom too, exactly the same. My nursery, my crib, my Dad saw her on the ceiling.

MAX
Your Dad must have been as drunk as mine.

SAM
No, no. It's the same thing, Max. The same thing killed our mothers.

MAX
That's impossible.

SAM
This must be why I'm having visions during the day. Why they're getting more intense. Cause you and I must be connected in some way. Your abilities, they started 6-7 months ago right, out of the blue?

MAX
How'd you know that?

SAM
Cause that's when my abilities started Max. Yours seem to me much further along but still, this has to mean something right? I mean for some reason, you and I...you and I were chosen.

MAX
For what?

SAM
I don't know. But Dean and I, my brother and I, we're hunting for your Mom's killer. We can find answers, answers that can help us both. But you gotta let us go Max. You gotta let your stepmother go.

MAX
(Thinking, then starting to shake his head) No. What they did to me. I still have nightmares. I'm so scared all the time, like I'm just waiting for that next beating. I'm so sick of being scared all the time, I just want this to be over!

SAM
It won't. Don't you get it? The nightmares won't end, Max. Not like this. It's just, more pain. And it makes you as bad as them. Max, you don't have to go through all this by yourself.

MAX
I'm sorry.

MAX uses his powers to fling SAM backwards into the hall closest and slam the door. He looks across and a tall, heavy, hallway bookshelf slides in front of the doors, blocking them.

SAM
(Banging on the doors) No. Max!

.....................

INTERIOR. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM.

MS MILLER sits on the bed, DEAN crouches beside her, holding a facecloth to her bleeding forehead. The door creaks open on its own and MAX walks in. DEAN rises and moves purposefully toward MAX as the door closes behind him. MAX sends DEAN flying and he crashes into the wall.

MS MILLER
Max!

MAX raises DEAN's pistol, his hand shaking.

DEAN
Son of a...

DEAN rises, freezing when he sees the gun, then again beginning to walk toward MAX. He stops when MAX lets go of the gun, leaving it floating in mid air. It cocks, then turns to point at MS MILLER. DEAN steps in its way.

MAX
(Warningly) Stay back. This is not about you.

DEAN
You wanna kill her you gotta go through me first.

MAX
Ok.

The gun fires. Blood splatters over the wall. We see DEAN with a bullethole in the middle of his forehead, eyes blank. He wavers and crashes heavily to the ground. The camera pans from MS MILLER'S shocked face down to DEAN, sprawled on the ground, eyes open. DEAD.

.................................

INTERIOR. DOWNSTAIRS CLOSET.
SAM comes back to himself, gasping and holding his head and we realize it was a vision.

SAM
(Panicked) No. NOOO!!!

The bookcase in front of the closet doors slides away. SAM freezes, then pushes the door with his hand. It swings open.

.......................

INTERIOR. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM.

The gun, in midair, turns to point at MS MILLER.

MS MILLER
Max. No.

DEAN steps in front of her and the gun turns to point at him.

MAX
Stay back. It's not about you.

DEAN
You're going to kill her you gotta go through me first.

MAX
Ok.

The door bursts open and SAM comes in.

SAM
No don't! Don't! Please. Please. Max. Max. We can help you. All right. But this, what you're doing. It's not the solution. It's not gonna fix anything.

MAX is a mess, he is shaking, sweaty, in tears. He stares at SAM, anguished. Suddenly he relaxes a little, his face clears.

MAX
You're right.

Sam smiles at him, but MAX turns away from him, as the gun swings to point at MAX. He shoots himself in the head.

SAM
NO!!

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INTERIOR. DOWNSTAIRS LOUNGE.

MS MILLER
(sitting on couch, in shock) Max attacked me. He threatened me with a gun.

COP
(indicating SAM and DEAN) And these two?

MS MILLER
They're...family friends. I called them soon as Max arrived, I was scared. They tried to stop him. They fought for the gun.

COP
Where did Max get the gun?

SAM and DEAN exchange looks.

MS MILLER
(Beginning to cry and looking at the ceiling) I don't know. He showed up with it and...(she breaks down)

COP
It's all right Ms Miller.

MS MILLER
(Sobbing) I've lost everyone.

COP
(To SAM and DEAN) We'll give you a call if we have any further questions.

DEAN
Thanks officer. (Patting SAM'S arm) Come on.

.......................

EXTERIOR. MILLER HOUSE.

SAM and DEAN walk down the path.

SAM
If I'd just said something else. Gotten through to him somehow.

DEAN
Ah, don't do that.

SAM
Do what?

DEAN
Torture yourself. It wouldn't have mattered what you said, Max was too far gone.

SAM
When I think about how he looked at me man, right before. I shoulda done something.

DEAN
Come on man, you risked your life. I mean yeah, maybe if we had gotten there 20 years earlier.

They move to either side of the Impala.

SAM
Well I'll tell you one thing. We're lucky we had Dad.

DEAN
(Looking astounded...and pleased) Well I never thought I'd hear you say that.

SAM
Well, it coulda gone a whole other way after Mom. I little more tequila and a little less demon hunting and we woulda had Max's childhood. All things considered, we turned out ok. Thanks to him.

DEAN
(Turning back to look at Max's house) All things considered.

......................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

SAM places a bag in the trunk of the Impala which is backed up to the door, and returns inside.

SAM
Dean I've been thinking.

DEAN
Well that's never a good thing.

SAM
I'm serious. I been thinking, this demon, whatever it is. Why would it kill Mom, and Jessica, and Max's mother, you know? What does it want?

DEAN
I have no idea.

SAM
Well, you think, maybe, it was after us? After Max and me?

DEAN
Why would you think that?

SAM
I mean, either telekinesis or premonitions, we both had abilities, you know? Maybe he was, he was after us for some reason.

DEAN
Sam. If it had wanted you, it would've just taken you. Ok? This is not your fault, it's not about you.

SAM
Then what is it about?

DEAN
It's about that damn thing that did this to our family. The thing that we're gonna find, the thing that we're gonna kill. And that's all.

SAM
Actually there's uh ... there's something else too.

DEAN
Ah jeez what.

SAM
When Max left me in that closet, with that big cabinet against the door ... I moved it.

DEAN
Huh. You got a little more upper body strength than I gave you credit for.

SAM
No man, I moved it. Like, Max.

DEAN
(Pausing his gathering of clothes and standing still) Oh.

Silence.

DEAN
(softly) Right.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
(Picking up a spoon) Bend this.

SAM
(Frustrated) I can't just turn it on and off Dean.

DEAN
Well how'd you do it?

SAM
I don't know, I can't control it. I just....I saw you die and it just came out of me, like a, like a punch. You know like...a freak adrenaline thing.

DEAN
Yeah well I'm sure it won't happen again.

SAM
Yeah, maybe. Aren't you worried, man? Aren't you worried I could turn into Max or something?

DEAN
Nope. No way. You know why?

SAM
No. Why?

DEAN
Cause you got one advantage Max didn't have.

SAM
Dad? Because Dad's not here, Dean.

DEAN
No. Me. (smirking) As long as I'm around, nothing bad is gonna happen to you.

Sam does puppy dog look and a tiny smile.

DEAN
(Slinging his bag over his shoulder and moving toward Sam) Now then. I know what we need to do about your premonitions. I know where we have to go.

SAM
Where?

DEAN
(Deadpan) Vegas.

DEAN grins at SAM

SAM tilts his head, looks away, looks back, does bitchface and walks out the door to the car.

DEAN
What? Come on man. Craps tables. We'd clean up!

DEAN follows SAM to the door and pauses on the threshold. He considers SAM, looking very thoughtful, then turns to pull the door closed.
