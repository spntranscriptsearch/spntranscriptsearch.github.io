TEASER
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Fade into shot of a clock tower, reading 12:21. Pan down to a smiling, late-middle aged man (DR. JENNINGS), walking down the sidewalk. His cell phone rings; he picks it up.

DR JENNINGS
Hello. Yeah.

White-flash image of a gun barrel raising.

DR JENNINGS
All right.

Cut to another image of DR JENNINGS cocking a shotgun. Back to DR JENNINGS' face; he lowers the phone slowly. A city bus with a triangular Blue Ridge logo on the front passes. He smiles, turns, and continues walking. Across the street he enters a sports equipment shop and approaches a man leaning against a counter reading GUNS magazine.

DR JENNINGS
Afternoon, Dennis.

DENNIS
Hey, Doc.

DR JENNINGS
I'd like to look at a gun.

DENNIS
(laughing)
Yeah, right, doc.

DR JENNINGS just looks at him

DENNIS
Seriously?

He crosses behind the counter in front of a display of guns. DR JENNINGS looks around, then points.

DR JENNINGS
That one.

DENNIS unlocks the display and pulls out the indicated gun.

DENNIS
Okay. That's a turkey hunter, twelve gauge, pump action. Doesn't leave enough turkey behind, if you ask me.

DR JENNINGS
What sort of shells does it use?

DENNIS
(pulling a box from under the counter)
Right here. I'm taking the boys up to the cabin this weekend if you're uh... I mean if you think you might like to take up the sport.

DR JENNINGS
(taking a shell and starting to fit it into the gun)
Thanks, but no. You know guns make me nervous, always have. This one goes in here, right?

DENNIS
Whoa, Doc! No, you can't load a weapon on the premises, it's illegal!

DR JENNINGS
It's okay, Dennis.

DENNIS
No, no.

DR JENNINGS
It's okay, Dennis. It's all gonna be okay.

He turns the gun on Dennis and fires.

DENNIS
Doc!

DENNIS is hurled against the wall as the blast hits him. The other customers start to panic.

DR JENNINGS
No, no, it's, it's okay. It's okay. It's all gonna be okay.

He presses the shotgun against his chin; pan up to a sample sink hanging on the wall above his head; the shotgun goes off again and the sink is splattered with blood. Cut to ...



INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

SAM gasps. He is leaning over the sink in a dingy bathroom, the water running. White flashes from the previous scene cut across his vision.

SAM
No...

He runs a hand under the water and washes his face, scrubbing the hand through his hair. As he shuts the water off and looks up into the mirror, the door bursts open to reveal DEAN.

DEAN
Sam, come on, zip it up. Let's hit the... (he pauses, absorbing Sam's Condition) ... road. What?

Close on SAM, breathing heavily and blinking.

ACT ONE
TITLE CARD:
SUPERNATURAL

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

DEAN is driving the IMPALA, SAM in the passenger's seat, down a dark two-lane road. The radio is playing.

RADIO ANNOUNCER
Rockin' Nebraska. Your source for the classics, all night long.

DEAN
I don't know, man, why don't we just chill out, think about this.

SAM
(shutting off the radio)
What's there to think about?

DEAN
I just don't know if going to the Roadhouse is the smartest idea.

SAM
Dean, it's another premonition. I know it. This is gonna happen, and Ash can tell us where.

DEAN
Yeah, man, but...

SAM
Plus it could have some connection with the demon. My visions always do.

DEAN
That's my point. There's gonna be hunters there. I don't know if, if, if going in and announcing that you're some supernatural freak with a, a demonic connection is the best thing, okay?

SAM
So I'm a freak now?

DEAN
(slapping SAM on the thigh)
You've always been a freak. (Dean smiles weakly and turns back to the road.)



INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

JO is playing a shooter arcade game as an older man (ED) watches. She hits every target, and he groans.

ED
Damn, little lady, that was my room money.

JO
(taking the money he pulls out)
Well, I guess you're taking a truck nap tonight.

As she walks away, pleased with herself, ELLEN walks over.

ELLEN
Oughta check the high scores before you put your money down.

She presses a button on the game and a list of high scores - all reading "Player: Jo" scrolls across the screen.

ELLEN
You went and got yourself hustled, Ed.

DEAN and SAM enter, passing two men at a table cleaning weapons. DEAN almost runs into JO, who stops, smiling.

JO
Just can't stay away, huh?

DEAN
Yeah, looks like. How you doin', Jo?

SAM
(hurried)
Where's Ash?

JO
In his back room.

SAM
(brushing past her)
Great.

JO
And I'm fine...

DEAN
Sorry, he's, we're... kind of on a bit of a timetable.



INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

SAM approaches a rough wooden door with a sign hanging on it that reads:

DR BADASS IS: IN

SAM
(knocking on the door)
Ash? Hey, Ash?

DEAN
(also knocking)
Hey, Dr. Badass?

The door is unlatched and opened a crack to reveal ASH, who is naked. DEAN averts his eyes.

ASH
Sam? Dean? Sam and Dean.

SAM
Hey Ash. Um. We need your help.

ASH
Well, hell then. Guess I need my pants.

He shuts the door; SAM and DEAN go back to:



INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

ASH is sitting at a table with his laptop open, looking at the hand-drawn sketch of the bus logo from SAM'S vision. SAM sits across from him; DEAN stands behind.

ASH
Well, I got a match. It's the logo from the Blue Ridge bus lines in Guthrie, Oklahoma.

SAM
Okay. Do me a favor - check Guthrie for any demonic signs, or omens, or anything like that.

ASH
You think the demon's there?

SAM
Yeah, maybe.

ASH
Why would you think that?

DEAN
Just check it, all right?

ASH gives him a Look; DEAN and SAM frown at each other.

ASH
No, sir, nothing. No demon.

SAM
All right, try something else for me. Search Guthrie for a house fire. It would be 1983, fire's origin would be a baby's nursery, night of the kid's six month birthday.

ASH looks at him, startled, and DEAN looks around to check for eavesdroppers. JO, cleaning a table nearby, is watching them.

ASH
Okay, now that is just weird, man. Why the hell would I be looking for that.

SAM pulls out a beer bottle and sets it next to the laptop.

SAM
'Cause there's a PBR in it for ya.

ASH
Give me fifteen minutes.



LATER

JO presses a few buttons on the jukebox and the opening chords to REO Speedwagon "Can't Fight This Feeling" play. Dean, sitting at the bar, looks horrified. JO carries a tray to the bar and sets it down, catching his eye.

(LYRICS)
I can't fight this feeling any longer.
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow.
What started out as friendship,
Has grown stronger.
I only wish I had the strength to let it show.


I tell myself that I can't hold out forever.
I said there is no reason for my fear.
Cause I feel so secure when we're together.
You give my life direction,
You make everything so clear...

JO
What?

DEAN
REO Speedwagon?

JO
Damn right REO. Kevin Cronin sings it from the heart.

DEAN
He sings it from the hair. There's a difference.

JO
That profile you've got Ash looking for?

DEAN
Hmm.

JO
Your mom died the same way, didn't she? A fire in Sam's nursery?

DEAN
Look, Jo, it's kind of a family thing.

JO
I could help.

DEAN
I'm sure you could. But we've got to handle this one ourselves. Besides, if I ran off with you I think your mother might kill me.

ELLEN, cleaning glasses behind the bar, looks at him. He smiles nervously.

JO
You're afraid of my mother?

DEAN
I think so.

SAM
(hurrying up behind JO)
We have a match. We've gotta go.

DEAN
All right, Jo. See you later.



INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

The strains of "Can't Fight This Feeling" from the previous scene continue in Dean's voice, singing a capella.

DEAN
(singing)
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might...

SAM
You're kidding, right?

DEAN
I heard the song somewhere, I can't get it out of my head, I don't know, man. Whaddya got?

SAM
(looking at a stack of papers)
Andrew Gallagher. Born in eighty three, like me. Lost his mother in a nursery fire exactly six months later, also like me.

DEAN
You think the demon killed his mom?

SAM
Sure looks like it.

DEAN
How did you even know to look for this guy?

SAM
Every premonition I've had, if they're not about the demon they're about the other kids the demon visited. Like Max Miller, remember him?

DEAN
Yeah, but Max Miller was a pasty little psycho.

SAM
The point is he was killing people. And I was having the same type of visions about him. And now it could be happening all over again with this Gallagher guy.

DEAN
How do we find him?

SAM
Don't know. No current address, no current employment. He still owes money on all his bills - phone, credit, utilities...

DEAN
Collection agency flags?

SAM
None in the system.

DEAN
They just let him take a walk?

SAM
Seems like it. There's a work address from his last W-2, about a year ago. Let's start there.



INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Close shot on coffee being poured into a cup by TRACY. SAM and DEAN, in suits, are sitting at a table.

TRACY
You won't get anything out of Andy, guys. I'm sorry, but they never do.

SAM
"They"?

TRACY
You're debt collectors, right? Once in a while they come by. I don't know what Andy says to them, but they never come back.

DEAN
Actually we're, we're lawyers. Representing his Great Aunt Leta. She passed, God rest her soul, and left Andy a sizable estate.

SAM
Yeah. So are you a friend of his?

TRACY
I used to be, yeah. I don't see much of Andy anymore.

WEBER
Andy? Andy kicks ass, man.

DEAN
Is that right?

WEBER
Yeah. Andy can get you into anything. He even got me backstage at Aerosmith once, it was beautiful, bro.

TRACY
How about bussing a table or two, Weber?

WEBER
Yeah. You bet, boss.

TRACY
Look, if you want to find him, try Orchard Street. Just look for a van with a barbarian queen painted on the side.

DEAN
Barbarian queen?

TRACY
She's riding a polar bear. It's kind of hard to miss.



EXT. ORCHARD STREET - DAY

As DEAN and SAM stake out Orchard Street, watching the aforementioned van-with-barbarian-queen, the song "Stonehenge" from Spinal Tap plays.

(LYRICS)
Stonehenge
where the demons dwell
Where the banshees live and they do live well
Stonehenge
Where a man is a man
and the children dance to the pipes of pan

DEAN
I'm sorry, I'm starting to like this dude. That van is sweet.
(looking at SAM)
What's wrong?

SAM
Nothing.

DEAN
Sam, you look like you're sucking on a lemon, what's going on?

SAM
This Andrew Gallagher, he's the second guy like this we've found, Dean. Demon came to them when they were kids, now they're killing people.

DEAN
We don't know what Andrew Gallagher is, all right? He could be innocent.

SAM
My visions haven't been wrong yet.

DEAN
What's your point?

SAM
My point is, I'm one of them.

DEAN
No, you're not.

SAM
Dean, the demon said he had plans for me and children like me.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
Yeah, maybe this is his plan, maybe we're all a bunch of psychic freaks, maybe we're all supposed to be —

DEAN
What, killers?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
So the demon wants you out there killing with your minds, is that it? Come on, give me a break. You're not a murderer, Sam! You don't have it in your bones.

SAM
No? Last I checked, I kill all kinds of things.

DEAN
Those things were asking for it. There's a difference.

DEAN looks out the window, away from SAM. ANDY exits a building, wearing a pajamas and a long satin robe embroidered with dragons.

"STONEHENGE" continues over the following.

(LYRICS)
Stonehenge
Tis a magic place
where the moon doth rise with a dragon's face
Stonehenge
Where the virgins lie
And the prayer of devils fill the midnight sky
And you my love, won't you take my hand
We'll go back in time to that mystic land
Where the dew drops cry and the cats meow
I will take you there
I will show you how

SAM
Got him.

A woman in a second-story window waves to ANDY, who blows her a kiss. ANDY greets a man on the street, who smiles at him and hands ANDY his coffee. Further along, ANDY greets DR JENNINGS and shakes his hand.

SAM
That's him. That older guy, that's him, that's the shooter.

DEAN
All right, you keep on him, I'll stick with Andy. Go.

SAM gets out of the car and follows DR JENNINGS on foot. ANDY gets in his van and drives off, DEAN following in his car.

A few minutes later, ANDY stops and gets out of the van, walking back to DEAN, who tucks a handgun into his jacket.

ANDY
Hey.

DEAN
Hey hey.

ANDY
This is a cherry ride.

DEAN
Yeah, thanks.

ANDY
Man, the '67? Impala's best year if you ask me. This is a serious classic.

DEAN
Yeah. You know, I just rebuilt her, too.

ANDY
Yeah?

DEAN
Yeah, can't let a car like this one go.

ANDY
Damn straight. Hey. Can I have it?

DEAN
Sure, man.

DEAN gets out of the car, smiling, to let ANDY in the driver's side.

ANDY
Sweet.

DEAN
Hop right in there. There ya go.

ANDY
Take it easy.

DEAN
All right.

ANDY drives off in the IMPALA, leaving DEAN standing in the street, looking confused.



EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

SAM watches DR JENNINGS from a short distance; DR JENNINGS' cell phone rings, just like in the vision, and he answers it.

DR JENNINGS
Hello. Yeah.

SAM sees the BLUE RIDGE bus approach, and crosses in front of it towards the sporting goods store. He runs up the steps and inside, looking around. He sees the clerk and bystanders from his vision. He turns and pulls the fire alarm.

DR JENNINGS approaches the store, but hearing the alarm go off he stops, confused, then turns and walks away.

SAM leaves the store and goes down to the street, where he sees ANDY drive by in the IMPALA. He stares in shock.

DR JENNINGS gets another cell phone call.

DR JENNINGS
Hello? Yeah? All right.

SAM
(on his cell phone)
Dean! Andy's got the Impala!

DEAN
I know! He just sorta asked me for it and I, I let him take it.

SAM
You what?

DEAN
He full-on Obi-Wanned me. It's mind control, man!

SAM watches in horror as DR JENNINGS walks in front of a bus, which slams into him at full speed.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXT. STREET - DAY

As paramedics put DR JENNINGS' into a body bag, SAM sits on the curb nearby. DEAN crouches behind him, hand on his back.

SAM
I kept him out of the gun store. I thought he was okay. I thought he was past it, at least... I should have stayed with him.



INT. DINER - DAY

WEBER is busing dishes as ANDY enters, looking upset.

WEBER
Andy! Whassup, dog?

He raises a hand to high-five ANDY, who ignores him and heads for TRACY.

TRACY
Andy! What are you doing here?

ANDY
Doctor Jennings.. he's dead.

TRACY
Oh no, I'm sorry.

ANDY
I don't know, I, I, was, I was upset, and I wanted to see you.

TRACY
(putting her hands on his)
Well, I'm glad you did. I um, I missed you. Oh, you know what? Some guys were here this morning looking for you.

ANDY
What guys?



EXT. STREET - DAY

Close shot through the interior of the IMPALA as SAM and DEAN approach from across the street.

DEAN
Thank god! Oh. I'm sorry, baby. I'll never leave you again. Well, at least he left the keys in it.

SAM
Yeah. Real Samaritan, this guy.

DEAN
Well, it looks like he can't work his mojo just by twitching his nose, he's gotta use verbal commands.

SAM
The doctor had just gotten off his cell phone when he stepped in front of that bus. Andy must have called him or something.

DEAN
I don't know, maybe.

SAM
Beg your pardon?

DEAN
I just don't know if he's our guy, Sam.

SAM
Dean, you had O.J. convicted before he got out of his white Bronco and you have doubts about this?

DEAN
He just doesn't seem like the stone-cold killer type, that's all. You know. And O.J. was guilty.

SAM
Either way, how are we going to track this guy down?

DEAN
(thinking)
Not a problem.



EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

DEAN and SAM approach ANDY'S blue van from the back.

DEAN
Not exactly an inconspicuous ride. Let's have a look.

DEAN pulls a small crowbar out of his jacket and pries open the back door. Porn music plays as the interior is revealed: disco ball, fur rugs, a tiger painted on the wall, several thick books, and an enormous bong.

DEAN
Oh. Oh, come on. This is... this is magnificent, that's what this is. Not exactly a serial killer's lair, though. There's no... clown paintings on the walls, or scissors stuck in victims' photos. I like the tiger.

SAM
(looking at the books)
Hegel, Kant, Wittgenstein? That's some pretty heavy reading, Dean.

DEAN
Yeah, and uh, and Moby Dick's bong.



EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY

DEAN and SAM are sitting in the parked IMPALA. DEAN is eating something in a foil wrapper as SAM studies a stack of papers.

DEAN
Ugh. You know, one day I'd love to just sit down and eat something I didn't have to microwave at a minimart.

SAM
What I don't get is the motive. I mean, the doctor was squeaky clean, why would Andy waste him?

DEAN
If it is Andy.

SAM
Dude, enough.

DEAN
What?

SAM
The doctor was mind-controlled in front of a bus. Andy just happens to have the power of mind control. You do the math.

DEAN
I just don't think the guy's got it in him, that's all.

SAM
Well, how the hell would you know? I mean, why are you bending over backwards defending him?

DEAN
'Cause you're not right about this.

SAM
About Andy?

ANDY appears suddenly at SAM'S (open) window, slamming his hands down and leaning in.

ANDY
Hey! You think I haven't seen you two? Why are you following me?

The last sentence reverberates strangely; DEAN looks stunned.

SAM
(calmly)
Well, we're lawyers. See, a relative of yours has passed aw-

ANDY
(echoing)
Tell the truth!

SAM
That's what I'm -

DEAN
We hunt demons.

ANDY
What?

SAM
Dean!

DEAN
Demons and spirits. Things your worst nightmares wouldn't even touch. Sam here, he's my brother.

SAM
Dean, shut up!

DEAN
I'm trying. He's psychic. Kind of like you. Well, not really like you, but see, he thinks you're a murderer, and he's afraid that he's going to become one himself, 'cause you're all part of something that's terrible. And, I hope to hell that he's wrong, but I'm starting to get a little scared that he might be right.

ANDY
Okay, you know what? (Uses demonic voice:) Just leave me alone.

DEAN
Okay.

ANDY
All right? (Andy walks away.)

DEAN cringes, holding his head, as SAM gets out of the car, following ANDY.

ANDY
What are you doing? Look, I, I said leave me alone. (using demonic voice) All right? Get out of here, just start driving and never stop.

SAM
Doesn't seem to work on me, Andy.

ANDY
What?

SAM
You can make people do things, can't you? You can tell them what to think.

DEAN has gotten out of the car; SAM holds up a hand, warning him not to come closer.

ANDY
Look, tha-- (laughs) that's crazy.

SAM
It all started about a year ago, didn't it? After you turned twenty-two. Little stuff at first, and then you got better at controlling it.

ANDY
How do you know all this?

SAM
Because the same thing happened to me, Andy. My mom died in a fire, too. I have abilities too. You see, we're connected, you and me.

ANDY
You know what? Just, just, just, just get out of here (demonic voice), all right?!

SAM
Why did you tell the doctor to walk in front of a bus?

ANDY
What?

SAM gets a vision -- flash of fire, and a hand holding a gas pump. He cringes. The vision continues in pieces as he tries to focus on ANDY.

SAM
Why did you kill him?

ANDY
I didn't!

SAM cringes again as the vision hits with full force:



EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

A middle-aged blond woman (HOLLY) with leather gloves and a long black coat is pumping gas into an SUV. Her cell phone rings; she answers.

HOLLY
Hello?
(Flash of fire, a man shying away from it.)
Sure. I can do that.

She hangs up the phone and leans into the car, pressing down the cigarette lighter. She pulls out the gas pump and starts drenching herself in gasoline. A gas station employee across the way sees her.

MAN
Hey! Lady, what are you doing?!

HOLLY pulls the cigarette lighter out and steps into the open, holding her arms out.

HOLLY
It's gonna be okay.

She lowers the cigarette lighter to her drenched arm.

MAN
Lady, no! No!

She bursts into flames as the man watches in horror. The vision ends and we cut back to SAM.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
SAM, hands on his head, starts to fall; DEAN runs over to catch him and lowers him gently to the asphalt.

DEAN
Sam? What is it?

ANDY
Look, I didn't do anything to him.

SAM
A woman. A woman burning alive.

DEAN
What else'd you get?

SAM
A gas station, a woman is gonna kill herself.

ANDY
What does he mean, going to? What is he, what is -

DEAN (to ANDY)
Shut up!

SAM
She gets triggered by a call on her cell.

DEAN
When?

SAM
I don't know.
(DEAN helps him stand)
But as long as we keep our eyes on this son of a bitch he can't hurt her.

ANDY
I didn't hurt anybody.

SAM
Yeah, not yet.

A fire engine roars past, sirens blaring. They turn to watch it.

SAM to Dean:
Go.

DEAN runs off to follow the siren; ANDY tries to step past SAM, who stops him with a hand on his chest.

SAM
No, not you. You're staying here with me.



EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

The firemen are putting out the fire; DEAN calls SAM on his cell.

DEAN
Hey, it's me. She's dead. Burned up, just like you said.

SAM
When?

DEAN
Like minutes before I got here! I mean the smell hasn't even cleared. What's up with your visions, man? This wasn't even a head start.

SAM
I don't know, all right? I can't control them, I don't know what the hell is going on.

DEAN
Listen, you were with Andy when this whole thing went down, so it, it can't be him, it's gotta be somebody else doing this.

SAM
That doesn't make any sense.

DEAN
What else is new? Well, I'll dig around here, see what else I can find.



EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY

SAM and ANDY sit across from each other on an abandoned truck.

ANDY
So you get these premonitions of people about to die?
(SAM nods)
That's impossible.

SAM
(laughing)
A lot of people would say the same thing about what you do.

ANDY
But ... death visions.

SAM
Yeah.

ANDY
Dude, that sucks. I mean, like, when I got my mind thing? It was like a gift, you know, it was, it was like I won the Lotto.

SAM
But you still live in a van. I don't get it, I mean, you could ... have anything you ever wanted.

ANDY
I mean, I, I got everything I need.

SAM
So you're really not a killer, huh?

ANDY
(laughing)
That's what I've been trying to tell you!

SAM
That's good. Means there's hope for both of us.

DEAN pulls up in the IMPALA, and SAM and ANDY stand. DEAN gets out of the car.

DEAN
Victim's name was Holly Beckett, forty-one, single.

SAM
(to ANDY)
Who is she?

ANDY
Never heard of her.

DEAN
Called Ash on the way over here; he came up with a little something. Apparently Holly Beckett gave birth when she was eighteen years old, back in 1983. Same day you were born, Andy.

SAM
Andy, were you adopted?

ANDY
Well, yeah.

DEAN
You were? And you neglected to mention that?

ANDY
Never really came up. I mean, I, I never knew my birth parents, and, and like you said my adopted mom died when I was a baby -- do you, do you think this Holly woman could actually be my m-

DEAN
I don't know. I tried to get a copy of the birth records, but they're hard copy only, sealed in the county office.

ANDY
Well, screw that.



INT. RECORDS OFFICE - NIGHT

As SAM and DEAN go through boxes of files, ANDY walks an elderly security guard to the door.

GUARD
Probably shouldn't have left you kids in here.

ANDY
No, it'll all be fine. All right? Just go get a cup of coffee.
(as the guard leaves, he continues in a dramatic voice)
These aren't the 'droids you're looking for.

DEAN
(grinning as he overhears)
Awesome.

SAM
I got it.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
Yeah. Andy, it's true. Holly Beckett was your birth mother.

ANDY
Huh. Does anyone have a Vicodin?

SAM
Dr. Jennings was her doctor, too, I mean, he oversaw the adoption. You have a solid connection to both of them.

ANDY
Yeah, but I, I didn't kill them.

DEAN
We believe you.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
But uh, who did?

SAM
I think I got a pretty good guess. Holly Beckett gave birth to twins.

LATER
ANDY sits with both hands on his head, staring straight ahead in shock. DEAN is standing by a printer nearby, SAM is pacing with a folder in his hands.

ANDY
I have an evil twin.

SAM
Holly put you and your brother up for adoption. And you went to the Gallagher family, obviously, and your brother went to the Weems family from upstate.

DEAN
Andy, how you doin'? Still with us?

ANDY
Um. What was my brother's name?

SAM
Here. Um, Ansen Weems. And he's got a local address.

ANDY
He -- he lives here?

DEAN
Let's get a look at him. Got his picture coming off from the DMV right now.

DEAN pulls some papers out of the printer and looks at them in surprise.

DEAN
Hate to kick you while you're freaked. (Andy gives a whuf.) Take a look at that.

He shows one of the pages to ANDY, who looks up in shock.



INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

The coffee shop is nearly empty; WEBER and TRACY are closing up.

WEBER
Hey, Trace?

TRACY
Yeah?

WEBER
You and Andy, you guys went together for a while, didn't you?

TRACY
Yeah, Weber, why?

WEBER
I don't know, I was just wondering. I, I was wondering how you felt about him these days. I mean, I've seen you guys together, it seems like there's still something there. Just... were you guys ever, like, serious?

TRACY
Um, no.

WEBER
Come on, Trace.
(echoing with demon voice)
Tell the truth.



EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

DEAN drives the IMPALA down a dark road with SAM next to him and ANDY in the back seat.

SAM
All right, Andy. Tell us everything you know about this guy.

ANDY
Well, I mean, not much. I... Weber shows up one day, eight months ago? Acting like he's my best friend in the world. Kinda weird, like, trying too hard, you know?

SAM starts cringing, rubbing his eyes.

DEAN
Must have known you guys were twins. Why did he change his name? Why not just tell you the truth?

ANDY
No idea.

SAM
Aah!

DEAN
Sam?

Flashes of another vision come together into:



EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

TRACY, wearing only satin lingerie, walks slowly to the side of a ravine. Crying, she climbs onto the ledge and looks around. She pauses, looking back, then leaps. Cut back to:



INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

SAM yells in panic, struggling with the door.

DEAN
Sam? Sam! Sam!

He stops the car as SAM shoves the door open, leaning out. DEAN gets out and runs around the car to kneel beside him, grabbing his shoulders.

DEAN
Hey. Hey!

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

WEBER drives onto the bridge from the last vision and pulls to a stop; TRACY is in the passenger's seat. He runs a hand slowly up her thigh.

WEBER
I take my ladies here. They like it. Well, I mean, I like it, so ... of course they do too.

TRACY
(crying)
Please, I just wanna go home.

WEBER
Stop crying. (demon voice)
(She does.)
Hey. I get it. I see what you see in Andy, I mean, he's a genius. Books he reads? He's gonna be a great man someday. But he is my family, not yours. You can't have him. You're not gonna have anything after tonight.



EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Near the BRIDGE, the IMPALA pulls to a stop. SAM and DEAN get out and circle around to the trunk, which DEAN opens.

SAM
Dean, you should stay back.

DEAN
No argument here. Had my head screwed with enough for one day.

SAM pulls out two handguns; as he walks forward he's stopped by ANDY, who has gotten out of the car.

ANDY
I'm coming with you.

SAM looks, shakes his head no.
Andy, no.

ANDY
If it's Tracy out there ... then I'm coming.



INT. WEBER'S CAR - NIGHT

Crying again, TRACY is unbuttoning her dress as WEBER watches.

WEBER
Okay. Slower. Tracy? I want you to listen to me very carefully, okay? When we're done here, I want you to head over to the edge of the dam. Okay?

TRACY
Okay.

WEBER
And when you get there, you're gonna think you can fly (demonic echo) And you're just gonna step right off. You -- you can fly, can't you?

TRACY (sobbing)
Yeah. I think so.

WEBER
You might get scared, but I want you to say that it's okay. (Tracy is sobbing.) Just tell yourself, everything is okay.

The window behind WEBER'S head shatters, and SAM shoves a handgun in his face.

SAM
Get out of the car! Now!

WEBER (demonic echo)
You really don't want to do this.

SAM backhands him, hard. On the other side of the car, ANDY opens the door and pulls TRACY out.

ANDY
Tracy! Come here, come here, come here. It's okay.

TRACY
Andy! I can't! I couldn't control myself.

SAM opens WEBER'S door and pulls him out of the car. He pins him facedown over the pavement with the gun aimed at his head.

SAM
Don't move. Don't move!

ANDY runs over to them and shoves a strip of duct tape over WEBER'S mouth. He rears back and kicks WEBER twice, furious. SAM pushes him back.

SAM
No! No, Andy, let me handle this, all right?

ANDY
I'm gonna kill you!

SAM
No! I'll handle this, I'll handle this!

ANDY
I will kill you!

SAM
Andy! Listen to me! Listen to me!

WEBER stares at TRACY, who picks up a large stick and hits SAM on the back of the neck with it. He goes down, unconscious. ANDY turns to her as WEBER stands up.

ANDY
Tracy, stop! (demonic echo) I said STOP IT!

She drops the stick and backs away, terrified. ANDY turns back to WEBER, who pulls the duct tape off his mouth.

ANDY
How did you do that?

WEBER
Practice, bro. If you'd just practice, you would know. Sometimes you don't need to use your words. If you have to,
(tapping his forehead)
all you need is this. Sometimes the headache's worth it.

ANDY
(grabbing WEBER)
You're a twisted son of a bitch!

WEBER
Back off, Andy. Or Tracy's gonna do a little flying.

ANDY turns in horror to see TRACY standing on the ledge.

WEBER
Aren't you, Trace?
(to ANDY)
I'm stronger than you. I can do it.

ANDY
Okay, okay. (backs away, hands up.) Okay. All right, just... just please don't hurt her.

WEBER
Don't be mad at me, okay? I know, it's, it's all wrong. I didn't mean for this to happen, it's just... Tracy? She's trying to come between us.

ANDY
You're insane.

WEBER
She's garbage! Man, they all are! We can, we can push them, we can make them do whatever we want!

ANDY
Are you really... are you really this stupid? Is it--?

WEBER
Wha-

ANDY
I mean, you, you learn you've got a twin...
(SAM starts coming to)
... you call him up, you go out for a drink, you don't start killing people!

WEBER
I've wanted to tell you for so long, bro. But he didn't let me. He said I had to wait until the time was...

ANDY
Who?

WEBER
The man with the yellow eyes.

ANDY
What are you talking about?

WEBER
He came to me. In my dream. He said I was special. He told me he's got big plans for me. Wait 'till you see what's in store, Andy, for both of us! See, he's the one who told me that ... I had a brother. A twin.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Within shooting distance, DEAN stalks to a hiding place with a sniper rifle.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

ANDY
Why did you kill our mother? Why? And why Dr. Jennings?

WEBER
Because they split us up! They ruined our lives, Andy! We could have been together this whole time. Instead of alone. I couldn't, I couldn't let 'em do that, I couldn't let them get away with that. No.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

DEAN crouches in the shadows and lines up the shot.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

WEBER turns, hearing something. He peers into the distance, into DEAN'S hiding place.

WEBER
I see you. Bye-bye. (demonic echo)

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

DEAN turns the rifle up and tucks the barrel under his chin.

Close on TRACY'S face as a gunshot goes off. Cut to WEBER, who jerks; ANDY has shot him in the back. WEBER falls; ANDY lowers the gun, shaking.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. BRIDGE - MORNING

Rescue and police crews have arrived on the scene. ANDY is talking to three police officers, his stance confident. SAM is crouching by a wall, a paramedic tending to his shoulder. DEAN stands at his side.

ANDY
He shot himself. And you all saw it happen. (demonic echo)

POLICEMAN
Yeah. We did.

SAM and DEAN are together, observing. SAM:
Look at him. He's getting better at it.

ANDY passes an ambulance where TRACY is sitting, a blanket around her shoulders. She avoids his eyes. ANDY approaches SAM and DEAN.

ANDY
She won't even look at me.

SAM
Yeah, she's pretty shaken up.

ANDY
No, it's, this is different. It's, uh, I never, I never used my mind thing on her before. Before last night. She's scared of me now.

SAM
Hey, Andy, I hate to do this, but um, we have to get out of here. Here. I wrote down my cell. You don't have to be alone in this, all right? If anything comes up, just call me up.

ANDY
Wha- what am I supposed to do now?

DEAN
You be good, Andy. Or we'll be back.

SAM
(as they walk away)
Looks like I was right.

DEAN
About what?

SAM
Andy. He's a killer after all.

DEAN
No, he's a hero. He saved his girlfriend's life, he saved my life.

SAM
Bottom line, last night, he wasted somebody.

DEAN
Yeah, but he's not a foaming-at-the-mouth psycho. He was just, he was pushed into that.

SAM
Weber was pushed too, in his own way. Max Miller was pushed. Hell, I was pushed by Jessica's death.

DEAN
What's your point, Sam?

SAM
Right circumstances, everyone's capable of murder. Everyone. You know, maybe that's what the demon's doing. Pushing us. Finding ways to break us.

DEAN
Sam, we don't know what the demon wants, okay? Quit worrying about it.

SAM
You know, I heard you before, Dean, when Andy made you tell the truth. You're just as scared of this as I am.

DEAN
That was mind control! I mean, it's like, like, that's like being roofied, man, that doesn't count.

SAM
What?
DEAN
No. I'm, I'm calling do-over.

SAM
What are you, seven?

DEAN
Doesn't matter. Look, we've just gotta keep doing what we're doing, find that evil son of a bitch and kill it.

SAM (doubtfully)
Yeah, I guess.

DEAN'S cell rings. He picks it up.

DEAN
Hello? Ellen. What's going on? Yeah, we'll be right there.



INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY

SAM and DEAN are sitting at the bar, ELLEN behind it and JO walking around the outside.

ELLEN
Jo?

JO
Hmm?

ELLEN
Go pull up another case of beer.

JO
Mom...

ELLEN
Now. Please.

As JO leaves, ELLEN leans on the bar in front of SAM and DEAN.

ELLEN
So. You uh, you want to tell me about this last hunt of yours?

DEAN
No. Not really. No offense, it's just kind of a family thing.

ELLEN
Not anymore.
(dropping a stack of papers on the bar)
I got this stuff from Ash. Andrew Gallagher's house burnt down on his six month birthday, just like your house. You think it was the demon both times, don't you? You think it went after Gallagher's family?

SAM
Yeah, we think so.

DEAN
Sam...

ELLEN
Why?

DEAN
None of your business.

ELLEN
You mind your tongue with me, boy. This isn't just your war, this is war. Now, something big and bad's coming and it's coming fast, and their side holds all the cards. Now, at best all we got is us. Together. No secrets or half-truths here.

SAM
There are people out there, like Andy Gallagher, like me. And um ... we all have some kind of ability.

ELLEN
Ability?

(DEAN rolls his eyes, uncomfortable)

SAM
Yeah. Psychic ability. Me, I have, um, I have visions. Premonitions. I don't know, it's, it's different for everybody. The demon said he had plans for people like us.

ELLEN
What kind of plans?

SAM
We don't really know for sure.

ELLEN
These people out there, these psychics -- they dangerous?

DEAN
No. Not all of them.

SAM
But some are. Some are very dangerous.

ELLEN
Okay, how many of them are we looking at?

DEAN
We've been able to track a clear pattern so far. They've all had house fires on the night of the kid's six month birthday.

SAM
That's not true.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Weber? Or Ansen Weems, or whatever his name is -- I looked at his files, and there was no house fire. There's nothing out of the ordinary.

ELLEN
Which breaks pattern. So if there's any others like him, there'd be nothing in the system. No way to track 'em all down.

DEAN
And so who knows how many of 'em are really out there?

JO is standing behind.

ELLEN
Jo honey?

JO
Yeah?

ELLEN
You'd better break out the whiskey instead.
