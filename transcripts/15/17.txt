--NOW--

[EXTERIOR, Reykjavik, Iceland. Amara lounges in a pool watching the night sky and reading. A man brings her a towel]

MAN (in Icelandic): More wine?

AMARA: (also in Icelandic): No. Thank you.

[The man leaves, and she looks up at the sky and sees a meteor. Then many meteors and colorful northern lights. She's unsettled, gets out of the pool and puts on a robe]

AMARA: Welcome home, brother.


--TITLE CARD--


ACT 1
[INTERIOR: Bunker library. Sam is on the phone with Cas, his laptop and dozens of books spread on the table.]

SAM: Nothing? You sure?

[EXTERIOR: day, Cas is by his truck in a rural farm area]

CAS: Yes. I'd sequestered myself in the archives of the Basilica of Guadeloupe, chasing down a rumor of a spell so powerful it could, quote, wound God Himself. But it turns out it was just that-- a rumor. I just... I don't know what else to do.

SAM: That's alright. We'll find a way. Just get home.

[they disconnect the call as Dean enters the library]

DEAN: That Cas? [Sam doesn't even acknowledge Dean's presence] So that's how it's gonna be? You give me the silent treatment?

SAM: I'm not sure what you want me to say.

DEAN: That you get it. Like, I said, killing Amara, Jack dying... that's the only way.

SAM: "The only way." "Our one shot," "our last chance." You ever get tired of saying stuff like that?

DEAN: We don't have to like it, alright, but you and me, we gotta get it done.

[They're interrupted by a clattering noise coming from the kitchen. When they go to investigate, they find Amara helping herself to a bottle of beer.]

AMARA: Sam, Dean. We should talk.

[they return to the library with Amara, and are joined by Jack]

AMARA: My brother has returned. That means it's time.

SAM: Did he contact you?

AMARA: He's made himself known. How do you intend to cage him? When God caged me, he had four archangels. Do you have four archangels?

DEAN: Nope. We got one Jack.

[Amara hesitates and looks a bit sad as she realizes who Jack is to her]

AMARA: I wish we'd gotten to know one another. That's my fault. Maybe when all of this is over, we can?

DEAN: He's been juicing himself up, getting stronger.

JACK: But I need to complete a final ritual.

AMARA: What do you need me to do?

[INTERIOR: the war room. Cut to Dean walking Amara out after their conversation.]

DEAN: Just want to let you know, you are saving our asses here. You're saving the whole world's ass.

AMARA: I haven't saved anything yet.

DEAN: But when the time comes, we can count on you, right?

AMARA: Like I told you when we first met, you and I will always help each other.

[Amara vanishes, leaving Dean alone. Back in the library, Jack and Sam talk]

JACK: You're angry with me.

SAM: No, I'm not angry. I...

JACK: You're disappointed?

SAM: Jack, look... I wish you'd have been up front with us. But sacrificing your life for a cause... takes a lot of courage. I still think it's wrong, though.

[Dean enters, ending their moment]

DEAN: Alright, we're all set. Jack, why don't you go get your stuff. I'm thinking we leave now, we'll make Santa Fe by tomorrow morning.

[Jack leaves to pack his things]

SAM: Yeah, um, I'm not coming.

DEAN: What?

SAM: You and Jack got this covered.

DEAN: Chuck is back. You wanna take a knee?

SAM: That's not what I'm doing.

DEAN: Wh... You don't even have any leads.

SAM: What do you have, Dean? Honestly?! What, Billie's sending you to Santa Fe to... to meet up with her mystery guest that's gonna perform the "final ritual," or whatever that is, and turn Jack into a suicide bomb?

DEAN: Sam, you and me, we have to do this, it's in the book!

SAM: Oh, Chuck's "Death Book," right? Come on, man! Blindly following orders?! Lying to Amara, sending her to her death? Does any of this feel right to you?!

DEAN: It doesn't matter how we feel! You know what? Stay. Stay. But somebody's gotta be the grownup here.

SAM: Yeah, well, someone has to keep fighting for Jack.

DEAN: He knows what he signed up for!

SAM: Last I checked, we don't give up on family.

DEAN: Jack's not family. I know how you feel about the kid, okay. I care for him, too. I do. But he's not like you. He's not like Cas. He's just not.

[in a horrific display of bad timing, Jack returns to hear him]

JACK: I'm... I'm ready.

DEAN: Well, then, let's hit the road.

[Dean and Jack leave. EXTERIOR, the Impala driving at night, filled with awkward silence between Dean and Jack. Meanwhile, Cas returns to the Bunker, and joins Sam in the library]

CAS: Sam. Stayed behind to find another way, huh? I would've done the same.

[EXTERIOR, a peaceful woodland park. Amara sits on a bench holding a flower, communing with nature, when Chuck interrupts her repose]

CHUCK: Hey, sis.


ACT 2
[EXTERIOR, the park]

CHUCK: Hey, sis.

--AMARA--

CHUCK: You check out my light show the other night? It's pretty rad, huh?

AMARA: You've been ending worlds. And now you've come for this one?

CHUCK: Saved the best for last.

AMARA: And then what?

CHUCK: You know, I've been asking myself that question a lot lately... what happens after the end? And I have an idea... but I need your help.

AMARA: No. Absolutely not.

CHUCK: Come on! You know the rules. I can create, I can destroy, but I can't do a hard reset-- reboot everything-- without you.

AMARA: Not happening.

CHUCK: The Winchesters have gotten to you, huh? Figures-- you and Dean have that whole weird... thing.

AMARA: That wasn't you? Writing?

CHUCK: Ugh! Not that part. Gross.

AMARA: Well, I'm not on Dean's side. And I'm not on yours. Someone needs to defend this world.

CHUCK: Oh, please! You don't care about any of this.

AMARA: I do-- and so should you. Walk with me.

[Amara sets her flower down on the bench and stands up]

CHUCK: Okay, I'm walking. We're walking.

AMARA: You never slow down, do you? Take a breath-- revel in this wonderful thing you created.

CHUCK: Right-- and this is where you drop some sappy crap about how "perfect" my first tree was or whatever.

AMARA: Wasn't it, though? Perfect?

CHUCK: Yeah, it was pretty sweet. It was a fern. I was obsessed with fractals.

AMARA: Now you want to annihilate it? All of it.

CHUCK: No. You don't understand.

AMARA: Oh, I think I do. You want to evaporate every kernel of existence because the Winchesters won't do what you say.

CHUCK: It's not about that. It's about everywhere I look, I'm reminded of my failures. Like, why did I go with carbon-based life? Why not silicon? Or yttrium? Zeroing out-- starting fresh. That's what I need.

AMARA: None of this was a failure-- not a tree, not a human--

CHUCK: Humans! [scoffs] Humans are the worst. Lame, disappointing. They ruin everything they touch. And they're just so boring! I'm over them.

AMARA: What about your first children?

[Amara snaps her fingers, and they're both in Heaven's Throne Room.]

CHUCK: Heaven? Really? Look, I appreciate the effort, but none of this really lights my wick anymore. So, uh...

[Amara walks to a desk, picks up a bell and rings it]

AMARA: Remind me, how does your wick feel about fans?

[Half a dozen angels respond to the bell ringing, several holding bibles. One even has a pen]

VARIOUS ANGELS: Oh, is that really...?! It is! It's him. This is amazing! He's so handsome. He's everything.

TALLI: Oh, my God! I mean... Oh, my you! Could... Could you sign this for me?

[She hands Chuck her book and pen]

CHUCK: Sure.

TALLI: You are the way and the truth and the light.

CHUCK: Cool.

TALLI: Make it out to Talli. Actually, um, Crystal. Talli's a nickname. Actually, could you make it...

[Chuck becomes frustrated and snaps his fingers, and the angels disappear]

CHUCK: Okay! Don't worry... they're not gone, they're just... away. Oof, I guess "Don't meet your idols" goes both ways, am I right? So, meeting those mouth-breathers was supposed to inspire me to do what?

AMARA: I wanted you to feel their love... Their perfect angelic devotion.

CHUCK: Ah. Yeah.

[Chuck takes a deep breath and blows a long, loud raspberry]

AMARA: Really?

CHUCK: I've made up my mind. We can go round and round, but you know me. In the end, I always get what I want.

AMARA: What about what I want.

CHUCK: Okay... what do you want?

AMARA: Balance-- something we've never tried before-- creation and destruction, light and dark, brother and sister united again, but on behalf of one world-- this world. True balance. The way it was always meant to be.

CHUCK: Hmm. [Chuck shrugs]

AMARA: But you can't. You only care about your pleasure. Your story. Well, I guess that makes you the villain.

CHUCK: Villains get all the best lines.

[Amara snaps her fingers again, and they're transported to a workroom in the Bunker]

CHUCK: Oh! The Winchesters' bunker. Are they behind that door? Is this a parent trap sort of thing? 'Cause no. No way. Hasta la vis... [Chuck snaps his fingers and nothing happens, so he tries again] Hasta la... Okay, well, why is that not working? Is this a trap?

AMARA: I gave you an out, but you just wouldn't take it.

CHUCK: You B-word!

AMARA: The Winchesters have found a way to bind you, Brother.

CHUCK: What? No. No! You can't hold me here forever.

AMARA: I can hold you long enough.


ACT 3
[EXTERIOR, night, Dean and Jack in the Impala. They're still riding in uncomfortable silence. Dean glances over at Jack]

--DEAN--

DEAN: Listen, Jack, I don't know what you heard back there, but...

JACK: You don't have to say anything. And... you don't need to be sorry. I'm not like Sam or Cas. I... I understand.

[Dean doesn't have a reply, other than mild horror, and they resume their awkward silence. Hours later (after sunrise), they pull up in front of Jim's Gems, a jewelry shop in Santa Fe. They get out of the car and walk toward the door.]

DEAN: You sure this is the spot?

JACK: Billie said... this is where it ends.

[The door opens, revealing two people inside the shop]

ADAM: Jack?

JACK: Hello?

[Adam turns to his companion and they're both overwhelmed with excitement, and invite Dean and Jack inside]

ADAM: Hmm.

DEAN: So... you must be Billie's mystery guy, Jim?

ADAM: Oh, no, no, no! Jim's a buddy. He just lets me use his shop. I'm Adam.

DEAN: Oh. A-Adam.

ADAM: Yeah, you know... God's primo. First dude off the assembly line.

DEAN: Wait... The... The garden, the apple... that Adam?

ADAM: It was a quince, but yeah.

DEAN: Wow. So then that makes you Eve?

SERAFINA: Serafina. [She looks at Jack, but speaks to Adam] Babe.

ADAM: Yeah.

SERAFINA: His aura.

ADAM: I know.

SERAFINA: It's like Skittles.

JACK (to Dean): She's an angel.

ADAM: Yeah, she's my old lady. She's the only one who could put up with me all these years, huh?

SERAFINA: Awwww, babe.

[Adam and Serafina lose themselves for a moment making out]

DEAN: What's happening?

ADAM: Alright, let's get this party started. You're with me, Jack.

DEAN: Hey, w-w-wait, wait. Where you taking him?

ADAM: Oh, just a little private pop quiz. Can't hand out the "spark of the divine" to just anyone.

JACK: Dean, I'm okay.

[Jack follows Adam into the shop's back room, leaving Dean and Serafina out front]

JACK: So, you're really the first human?

ADAM: God's "first story," yeah. Jumped through every hoop, talked to every snake. When he kicked us out of paradise, Eve and me, we figured, eh, we deserved it. Then he moved on... to our sons.

[Adam sounds understandably bitter about this. Meanwhile, in the front of the shop...]

SERAFINA: Relax, babe! He's gonna pass.

DEAN: And you know that how?

SERAFINA: Saw it in my dreams. We were sipping mushroom tea in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

DEAN: So you were tripping balls and you saw Jack?

SERAFINA: Uh-huh.

DEAN: Awesome.

[Dean doesn't look as if he thinks any of this is actually awesome. Meanwhile, in the back room...]

JACK: You hate him.

ADAM: Oh, no. I've been wanting this for going on 300,000 years. Took me that long to figure out how to do it, too.

JACK: Wait— killing God is your plan?

ADAM: Yeah, Billie's been giving us a hand, yeah. Sera and me, this is our baby, yeah. She kept me alive this long so I could see it through. All we've been waiting on is you.

JACK: Me?

ADAM: Yeah. The main ingredient. Half-human, half-archangel, all-powerful. At least, you could be, if you pass the test. [Adam opens a display case with an assortment of crystals inside] So, here it goes. One of these pretty little suckers has been touched by God himself. It holds the spark of the divine. All you gotta do is tell me which one.

[Jack proceeds to examine the stones. Meanwhile, in the front room...]

SERAFINA: I mean, just think of, like, everything that had to happen for you to get Jack to this place, to this moment. Baby, it was meant to be.

[Dean looks uncomfortable with notion that any of this was "fated," but does nothing to stop it. Meanwhile, in the back room, Jack selects one of the stones...]

ADAM: That's your choice?

JACK: Yes. [Adam looks slightly disappointed, but Jack goes on] And the others. All of them. They're just rocks but their existence makes them divine. Because God is in everything.

ADAM: [he sighs with relief and smiles at Jack] Right on. At least, he should be.

[Adam and Jack return to the front room]

JACK: I did it.

SERAFINA: Far out! [she gives Jack a high five]

DEAN: Okay, uh, great... well, now what?

[Serafina embraces Adam and stabs him while they make out. Dean is justifiably alarmed by this]

DEAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?!

ADAM: Dudes, chill. [to Serafina] Do it.

[She reaches into his wound and pulls something out, and then heals the wound]

DEAN: What the hell is that?

ADAM: It's one of my ribs, dude. Everything can contain the spark of the divine, but this puppy? It's packing enough punch to create life. Or, in your case, destroy God.

SERAFINA: Jack, making your vessel strong, reclaiming your human soul, it was... it was all preparing you for this.

JACK: What'll it do to me?

ADAM: Start an elemental chain reaction. It fuses your soul and your grace into a... Like a...

SERAFINA: Metaphysical supernova.

DEAN: Meaning what?

ADAM: You'll collapse into a living black hole for divine energy. One nothing can escape— not the darkness, not God himself. But once it starts... you can't stop it.

[Serafina puts his rib into a ziploc bag, and Adam hands it to Jack]

ADAM: So, don't use 'til game time. You dig?

JACK: I dig.

ADAM: He digs.

[EXTERIOR, night, the Impala driving toward the bunker. Dean looks at the bag in Jack's hands and pulls over]

JACK: We're almost home.

DEAN: Yeah, I need to say something before we head in.

JACK: No, I-i-it's okay.

DEAN: Hold up. Just... What I said to Sam, you didn't need to hear that. Alright? Not now. Not with the weight that you're carrying— for us, for this world. Jack... I don't know how to explain it, but what I found out about Chuck... it's like—it's like I wasn't alive. Not really. You know, like, my whole life I've never been free. But like, really free. But now... now me and Sam, we got a shot at living a life. Without all this crap on our backs. And that's— that's because of you. So, I— I— I wanted to say... I need to say... Thank you, Jack. Thank you.

JACK: You're welcome.

DEAN: Yeah. Okay.

[Dean's phone buzzes and he reads the message, his face reflecting the gravity of its contents]

JACK: It's time, isn't it?

DEAN: It's time.

[Jack opens the bag and dumps the rib into his hand while Dean watches on intently. Jacks eyes glow gold and the rib disintegrates in his hand, while Dean watches with horror, and a bit of fear and regret]


ACT 4
[INTERIOR, the bunker library. Sam is still hard at work searching for another way. In frustration, he slams a book shut and shoves it off the table.]

--SAM--

[Cas enters, picks up the book, and returns it to the pile on the table]

SAM: Sorry.

CAS: It's alright. I understand it. I-I... I feel it, too. It's hopelessness.

SAM: Maybe Dean was right.

CAS: Yeah, maybe.

SAM: It just... It feels wrong. You know, Billie's got Dean so convinced.

CAS: But you don't believe her?

SAM: I don't know what I believe. I just wish I could talk to her, Billie, before it all goes down, you know, just to make sure.

CAS: There is no easy way to summon death, and I will not let you end your own life.

SAM: Cas, that's not what I'm saying. Wait... You remember when Sergei was here? Remember what he was looking for?

CAS: Yeah, it was the Key to Death.

SAM: Yes.

CAS: Wait, he said it would open the doorway to— to Death's Library.

SAM: If it's in the bunker and if we can find it, m-maybe I can just... walk up to her, right?

CAS: Right.

[montage of Sam and Cas researching the key and looking through boxes of artifacts. In a chest labeled "Copper Creek Mining Company," Cas finds a casket with the skull symbol from their research. Inside is the key they're looking for.]

CAS: Sam?

SAM: Cas, this has to be it.

CAS (handing Sam the box): There's an inscription.

SAM: It's in Latin. Viator mortalis, cave, quoniam scias Clavem Mortis pensare graviter. Il tamen desideres, ut introeas illum abyssum obscurissium artis, opus est tibi porta.

[The key glows in Sam's hand, and the illuminated outline of a doorway appears on the wall, with a glowing keyhole]

CAS: Sam, I should go with you.

SAM: No, Cas... Look, I don't know if this is crazy or... or what, but if Dean beats me back here... Buy me some time?

CAS: Sam, for what it's worth, I don't think you're crazy. I think your internal compass is functioning perfectly.

[Sam goes through the doorway into Billie's library. He's confronted by the body of a reaper on the ground, and then more dead reapers. In the distance he can hear screaming and cautiously explores]

REAPER: Please! Wait, wait, don't hurt me! No!

ANOTHER REAPER: Please, please. She won't come!

THE ENTITY: Keep praying or whatever.

REAPER: It's hopeless! Please! O-Okay, okay, okay. [he prays, and nothing happens] I told you.

[The Entity twists her hand and the reaper dies. Sam attempts to sneak away, but it's too late. She snaps her fingers and Sam is suddenly in front of her]

THE ENTITY: Sam Winchester?

SAM: Meg?

THE ENTITY: Sorry, she's still dead. Just borrowing the Queen's pretty face 'cause really, I'm Empty.

SAM: You're the Empty?

THE ENTITY: That's what I said.

SAM: What are you doing here?

THE ENTITY: Death and me need a word. Been trying her party-line, but she's ignoring me. I hate that.

SAM: What do you want?

THE ENTITY: The Empty was supposed to be mine. Not even God held sway. But lies, sweet little lies. Billie said when she takes over, she'd make it all better, but then your busted-ass friend in the trench coat came along and he gave me these trust issues.

SAM: Billie wants to take over?

THE ENTITY: Become "New God." Classic narcissist, right? She's all tingly for the rules, the good-old days.

SAM: What is that supposed to mean?

THE ENTITY: Everyone back to where they belong... realities, dimensions, graves. What should be dead dies, angels off Earth, demons back to Hell, and I go back to sleep. Or I'm supposed to. Except, again, trust issues. But you, you're Sam Winchester. You're in God's book. [she taps the thick book on Billie's desk]

SAM: That's... That's Chuck's Death Book? Have you read it?

THE ENTITY: Only Billie can read it, dummy. She always talked about how you should be so dead, except she needs you. So, maybe if I hurt you... [she holds up a hand and makes a fist. Sam crumples in pain and groans] Hear that? Get your scythe down here, Billie, or your boy's toast.

SAM: Wait! Stop! Billie sent me.

THE ENTITY (releasing her grip on Sam): She did what now?

SAM: Billie... She sent me.

THE ENTITY: Really? 'Cause you're saying a lot of dumb stuff for, you know, an Emissary of Death.

SAM: Yeah. We're all... We're trying to beat God. Not a whole lot of time for questions.

THE ENTITY: Go on.

SAM: Billie... sent me... to get the book. She didn't say why.

THE ENTITY: Where is she?

SAM: Earth. You can't go there, can you?

THE ENTITY: Only if I'm summoned. God's so protective of his little sand castles.

SAM: Well, Billie can't leave, either, something about the plan, so she sent me with a message. Billie will honor her promise. God, Amara-- they die. And you, you can go back to sleep.

THE ENTITY: And if you're lying?

SAM: I guess you have two choices. Give me the book— maybe we all win. But you kill me, we lose... And you will never go back to sleep.

[Sam returns through the door into the bunker's storeroom, bringing Chuck's Death Book with him]

SAM: Cas.

CAS: Sam, finally.

SAM: What?

CAS: It's Amara. She's here with Chuck. It's time.

SAM: No, no, no. Cas, we can't let that happen. We have to stop it.


ACT 5
[INTERIOR, the bunker. The room Amara has trapped Chuck in]

AMARA: It's not too late, brother. You can still choose this world, us. It doesn't have to end like this. I--

CHUCK: Amara. Shut up.

[INTERIOR, the bunker library.]

SAM: Chuck and Amara cannot die.

CAS: Wait, I don't understand.

[Dean enters, supporting Jack who is doubling over and clutching his stomach]

DEAN: Are they ready? We need to get this kid in the room right now.

SAM: Wait, wait... Dean... Dean, no. Listen!

[Back in the room where Chuck and Amara are]

CHUCK: You hear that?

AMARA: What?

CHUCK: Dean. Brought to the edge of doubt. His sense of duty, his rage winning out in the end.

[Back in the Library, Dean helps Jack through the halls while Cas and Sam follow]

SAM: Billie is playing us.

DEAN: So, what, her plan's not gonna work?

SAM: No, it will work.

DEAN: Then great.

SAM: But listen, if Jack takes out God and Amara, it'll create a power vacuum that Billie will fill. This was all her power grab.

CAS: Wait, Death wants to become God?

DEAN: As long as Chuck dies, I'm good.

SAM: Okay, listen, just stop. [He circles around in front of Dean, blocking the way]

DEAN: Get outta the way, Sam. What are you doing?!

SAM: I'm trying to make you listen.

[In the storage room with Chuck and Amara]

CHUCK: And poor Sam. Always gotta know everything. Can't leave well enough alone.

[In the Hallway]

DEAN: We don't have time! Jack already lit the fuse! We gotta go!

CAS: You did what?

DEAN: Sam, I'm not gonna ask you again.

SAM: Dean, please.

[Storeroom]

CHUCK: This is my ending. My real ending.

[Hallway]

DEAN (pulling his gun and aiming it at Sam): Move.

CAS: Dean, don't.

DEAN: Move, Sam. Move!

[Storeroom]

AMARA: You orchestrated this?

CHUCK: What part of omniscient do you people not understand? So I can't read my "Death Book." So what? I control space and time. Just plant a few visions, goad Death a little... Mess with a few outcomes... And... bada-bing! I mean... [laughing]They think they can kill me?

[Hallway]

SAM: Dean, don't do this.

DEAN: I don't want to do this, but this is everything!

SAM: No, it's not!

[storeroom]

AMARA: They're not going to kill you. They're going to cage you.

CHUCK: Oh, sis...

[hallway]

DEAN (cocking the gun): Get outta my way.

[Sam bats Dean's arm to the side and they struggle. Dean punches Sam]

[storeroom]

CHUCK: They want to kill me. And... they want to kill you. There's no cage. There never was.

[hallway]

[Dean carries on hurrying Jack toward the storeroom]

DEAN: Let's go, let's go.

SAM: Dean. No, Dean.

[Sam jumps Dean from behind, Jack tumbles to the floor. Sam holds Dean while Cas attends to Jack]

SAM: Wait. Stop! You gotta listen.

[Dean throws Sam off]

[storeroom]

CHUCK: Sam and Dean, they're using Jack to destroy us.

AMARA: No, but... but Dean can't hurt me.

CHUCK: No, but he can lie to you. He could send you into the meat grinder with a wink and a smile.

[Hallway]

DEAN (to Cas and Jack) You guys go, go!

SAM: Jack, don't!

CAS: Sam, why not?

SAM: Because if Billie takes over, then everyone goes back to where they belong. That means everybody from apocalypse world, Bobby, Charlie, they get sent back to a place that doesn't exist anymore. And everyone we saved. Eileen, she... she just dies again. And that's just the beginning.

[storeroom]

CHUCK: Look, I get it. You wanted him to care about you, but humans... they'll break your heart every time.

[hallway]

DEAN: Sam, we don't have a choice. Jack's about to blow!

SAM: We always have a choice.

[storeroom]

CHUCK: I spent so long searching for happiness, contentedness. In creation... or the Winchesters. But the only ones who will ever really "get" us... is us. You and me. Back together?

[hallway]

DEAN: There's nothing else we can do, okay?! We just gotta get out of the way.

SAM: No, we can't get out of the way, Dean, not this time.

DEAN: I don't care if Billie gets what she wants! I don't, man! I'd trade it all— I'd trade 'em all for Chuck in a heartbeat!

SAM: What about me? Would you trade me?

[storeroom]

AMARA: Balance.

CHUCK: Yes. Think of it. Us starting fresh. Creating something new, something beautiful... peaceful... together. And we can finally forget about all this pain. No baggage. Only balance.

[Chuck extends a hand to Amara. Tearful, she takes it and is absorbed into him. One of his eyes glows blue, and the other black.]

[hallway]

DEAN: Chuck has to die. He has to! Otherwise he'll keep us tap dancing forever, and I can't live like that, man! I can't live like that! I won't!

SAM: I know you feel like that right now, okay. I know you do. But you gotta trust me. My entire life, you've protected me— from Dad, from Lucifer, from everything. I didn't always like it, you know, but... it's the one thing in the whole world that I could always count on. It's the only thing I've ever known that was true. So please... put the gun away. Just put it away, and we'll figure it out, Dean, we'll find another way, you and me. We always do.

[Dean uncocks the gun and puts it away. Meanwhile, the door to the storeroom explodes and Chuck/Amara comes storming out]

CHUCK: Are you kidding me?! After everything, all that, you... you did it again!

CAS: Where's Amara?

CHUCK: Amara. Amara. She's in her somewhere.

CAS: What, you consumed your sister?

CHUCK: We came to an understanding, so spare me your contempt, Castiel, the self-hating angel of Thursday. You know what every other version of you did after "gripping him tight and raising him from perdition?" They did what they were told. But not you. Not the "one off the line with a crack in his chassis." All of you. You know, I tried and I tried and I tried, but you're all just too stupid, too stubborn. Too broken. You know what? I'm over it. I'm over you.

SAM: Yeah? Good.

DEAN: Screw you, Chuck.

CHUCK: No, screw you. You know what you do with broken toys? You throw them out. So, kill each other, don't kill each other... I don't care.

CAS: What do you mean?

CHUCK: I mean... have fun watching him die.

[Chuck points at Jack, who doubles over in pain]

CAS: Jack.

JACK: Help me!

DEAN AND SAM: Jack, Jack, Jack.

DEAN: Hey.

[Jack's eyes glow gold, and golden light breaks through cracks in his skin]

DEAN: Jack!
