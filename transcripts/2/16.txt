TEASER

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

A married couple (MOLLY and DAVID) are driving along a generic 2-lane blacktop at night. 'House of the Rising Sun' (The Animals) plays on the radio.

MOLLY
[driving]
We're lost.

DAVID
[reading the map]
No. This is a short cut...

MOLLY
Babe, it's just we've been on this road over an hour, and we haven't seen a single car.

DAVID
Molly, I know how to read a frickin' map, okay?

MOLLY
We passed a gas station a while back. Let's just go ask someone.

DAVID
That was 40 minutes ago. We're not turning around.

MOLLY
Come ON. Isn't this argument a little archaic? Men can ask directions these days.

DAVID
No, we can't. It's against our genetic code. Look, I know exactly where we are.

MOLLY
Oh, yeah? Where?

DAVID
Highway 99, okay? It cuts right through...

[they pass a sign that reads '41']

MOLLY
Highway 99, huh?

DAVID
Okay, so we, we're taking the scenic route.

MOLLY
David. It's our anniversary, and we're spending it stuck in the car.

DAVID
I know. I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you, okay? Come here.

[he leans over, kissing at her neck playfully]

MOLLY
Stop. I'm mad at you.

DAVID
Oh, come on, Molly. Hey, you love me.

MOLLY
[smiling despite herself]
No, I don't. You're a jerk. David, I mean it.
[she pushes him off, taking her eyes off the road. A MAN appears in the road before them.]

DAVID
Molly!

[screaming, she swerves to avoid the man and runs the car off the road]

[later: the car has crashed into a tree. MOLLY wakes up and looks around, disoriented.]

MOLLY
David? David?
[she crawls out of the wreck]
David? David?
[he is nowhere to be seen]
Da... David?!
[she staggers through the woods, calling for him]
David?! David?
[she comes upon a cabin, with a candle burning in the window]
Hello? Is anyone here?
[she enters]
Hello?
[she passes a wall covered in tools, then sees the MAN from the road standing with his back to her]
It's you. You're okay. I'm so sorry.
[close on his stomach, which she can't see and which is impaled and bloody]
I didn't see you there. Are you... Are you hurt?
[reaches out to touch him]
Sir?

[He turns towards her, blood dripping down his face. His mouth opens, spilling more blood, and his face turns dark and rotting. She glances down and sees his stomach. She screams.]

TITLE CARD: SUPERNATURAL

ACT ONE


EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

MOLLY runs through the woods away from the cabin. She staggers onto the road, where a car is approaching.

MOLLY
Stop!

She stands in the middle of the road, hands out.

DEAN
Holy-!

He stops the Impala just in front of her.

MOLLY
You've got to help me.
[goes to the passenger's side and pounds on the window, which SAM rolls down.]
Please. Please!

SAM
All right, all right. Calm down, calm down. Tell us what happened.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN have parked the IMPALA by the road and all three are standing around it.

MOLLY
I-I swerved, a-And we crashed. And when I came to, the car was wrecked and my husband was missing. I went looking for him, but that's when the man from the road, he... he started chasing me.

DEAN
Did he look like he lost a fight with a lawn mower?

MOLLY
How did you know that?

DEAN
Lucky guess.

SAM
Ma'am, what's your name?

MOLLY
Molly. Molly Mcnamara.

SAM
[exchanging a look with DEAN
I think maybe you should come with us. We'll take you back into town.

MOLLY
I can't. I have to find David. He might have gone back to the car.

SAM
We should get you somewhere safe first. Then Dean and I will come back. We'll look for your husband.

MOLLY
No. I'm not leaving here without him. Would you just take me back to my car, please?

SAM
Of course. Come on.

[EXT. WOODS - NIGHT]

The IMPALA parks by the woods near the crash site. They get out, MOLLY leading them into the woods.

MOLLY
It's right over there.
[they come upon the crash site, but the car is gone]
I don't understand. I'm sure this is where it was. W-We hit that tree right there. This... this doesn't make any sense.
[she goes to investigate, out of earshot]

SAM
Dean, we got to get out of here. Greeley could show up at any second.

DEAN
What are you gonna tell her?

SAM
The truth?

DEAN
She's gonna take off running in the other direction.

MOLLY
I know it sounds crazy, but I crashed into that tree. I don't know who could've taken it. It was totaled. Please. You have to believe me.

SAM
Molly, listen, we do believe you. But that's why we want to get you out of here.

MOLLY
What about David? Something must have happened. I have to get to the cops.

DEAN
Cops... that's a great idea. We'll take you down to the station ourselves. So just come with us. It's the best way we can
help you and your husband.

MOLLY
Okay.

[she comes back up]

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

They drive down the road, MOLLY in the backseat.

MOLLY
We're supposed to be in lake Tahoe.

SAM
You and David?

MOLLY
It's our five-year anniversary.

DEAN
A hell of an anniversary.

MOLLY
Right before, we were having the dumbest fight. (Sighs.) It was the only time we ever really argued... when we were stuck in the car.

SAM
(laughing) Yeah. I know how that goes.

[DEAN scowls at him]

MOLLY
You know the last thing I said to him? I called him a jerk. Oh, god. What if that's the last thing I said to him?

SAM
[turning to face her]
Molly... We're gonna figure out what happened to your husband. I promise.

[the radio starts making odd noises, then plays 'House of the Rising Sun'. DEAN frowns at it]

DEAN
Did you-- ?

SAM
No.

DEAN
I was afraid you'd say that.

MOLLY
This song ...

DEAN
What?

MOLLY
It was playing when we crashed.

The radio crackles again, and settles on another station. A creepy voice (GREELEY'S) can be heard.

GREELEY'S VOICE
She's mine. She's mine. She's mine.

MOLLY
What is that?

GREELEY appears in the middle of the road. Dean floors it straight at him.

DEAN
Hold on.

MOLLY
What are you doing?

[He drives straight into GREELEY, who vanishes in a puff of smoke]

MOLLY
What the... What the hell just happened?

SAM
Don't worry, Molly. Everything's gonna be all right.

[the IMPALA begins to shudder]

DEAN
Spoke a little too soon, Sammy.
[the IMPALA coasts to a stop on the side of the road. Dean tries to start it again but the ignition sputters.]
I don't think he's gonna let her leave.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

All three exit the car.

MOLLY
This can't be happening.

DEAN
Well... Trust me. It's happening.

He opens the trunk and starts pulling out weaponry. MOLLY comes around and sees the arsenal, backs away slowly.

MOLLY
Well... Okay. Thanks for helping, but I think I got it covered from here.

SAM
[going after her]
Wait. Molly, Molly, wait a minute.

MOLLY
Just leave me alone.

SAM
No no no. Please. You have to listen to me.

MOLLY
Just stay away.

[turns and starts to leave]

SAM
It wasn't a coincidence that we found you, all right?

MOLLY
[stops, turns back]
What are you talking about?

DEAN
We weren't just cruising for chicks when we ran into you, sister. We were already out here. Hunting.

MOLLY
Hunting for what?

DEAN
Ghosts.

SAM
[exasperated]
D... d... don't... Sugarcoat it for her.

MOLLY
You're nuts.

DEAN
Really? About as nuts as a vanishing guy with his guts spilling out. You know what you saw.

SAM
We think his name is Jonah Greeley. He was a local farmer that died 15 years ago on this highway.

MOLLY
Just ... stop.

SAM
One night a year, on the anniversary of his death, he haunts this road. That's why we're here, Molly. To try and stop him.

MOLLY
Now, I suppose this ... ghost made my car disappear, too.

DEAN
Crazier things have happened, huh?

MOLLY
You know what? I'm all filled up on crazy. I'm gonna get the cops myself.

DEAN
I don't mean to be harsh, but I don't think you're gonna get too far.

MOLLY
What is that supposed to mean?

DEAN
Means that plan A was trying to get you out of here. Obviously that didn't go over too well with, uh, Farmer Roadkill.

SAM
Molly, we're telling the truth. Greeley's not gonna let you leave this highway.

MOLLY
You're s... you're serious about this, aren't you?

DEAN
Deadly.

SAM
Every year, Greeley finds someone to punish for what happened to him. Tonight that person is you.

MOLLY
Why me? I didn't do anything.

SAM
Doesn't matter. Some spirits only see what they want.

MOLLY
So you're saying this ... Greeley, he took my husband? Oh, god.

SAM
Molly, look, we're gonna help, all right? But first, you gotta help us.

MOLLY
Help you? How?

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

MOLLY has led them back to the cabin where she saw GREELEY.

MOLLY
This is it. This is where I saw him.

DEAN
Must have been his hunting cabin.
[sees vicious tools hanging, a bloodstained table]
Huh. Seemed like a real sweet guy.

SAM
No markers or headstones outside.

MOLLY
You're looking for Greeley's grave?

SAM
Yeah.

MOLLY
Why?

DEAN
So we can dig up the corpse and salt and burn it.

MOLLY
Oh. Sure, naturally.

SAM
It's a way to get rid of a spirit.

MOLLY
And that'll save David?

SAM
Well, this is what'll help both of you, provided there's a corpse to be found.

MOLLY
So how do we find it?

SAM
I'm not sure. After Greeley died, his wife claimed the body. And that was the last anyone saw of her. So good guess she brought him back here. But they had a thousand acres. He could be buried anywhere on 'em.

MOLLY
So this is really what you guys do? You're like Ghostbusters?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Minus the jumpsuits.
[briskly]
This is a fascinating conversation and all, but this highway is only haunted once a year, and we got till sun-up to wrap this thing up. What do you say we move it along, okay? Great.

They go outside and continue their search.

MOLLY
What are we looking for?

SAM
Greeley's house. Maybe he's buried there. Look for roads or paths or something. Stay close.

MOLLY
Yeah. Okay.

She hears a voice.

VOICE
Molly? Molly, help me. Molly?

MOLLY
David? David? David!

She goes in search of the voice. GREELEY appears and grabs her. She screams.

DEAN
[pointing his shotgun at GREELEY]
Whoops.
[shoots GREELEY in the head. he dissipates]

SAM
[running to them]
Hey! Are you all right?

MOLLY
What has that son of a bitch done with my husband?

SAM
Just take it easy, all right? You're gonna see David again. You will.

DEAN
Hey!
[indicating something ahead of them]
Follow the creepy brick road.

SAM
[gesturing MOLLY to follow DEAN; SAM takes up the rear]
Go ahead.

MOLLY
That thing shoots rock salt?

SAM
Yep.

MOLLY
And plain salt keeps away spirits?

SAM
Simple remedies are always the best. In most cultures, salt's a symbol of purity, so it repels impure and unnatural things. Same reason you throw it over your shoulder.

[They round the corner and see a creepy house]

DEAN
You know, just once I'd like to round the corner and see a nice house.

SAM and MOLLY enter the house; DEAN stays outside to look around. DEAN enters.

SAM
Any headstones outside?

DEAN
Yeah, right. Is it ever that easy?

SAM
I guess not.

DEAN
You two check upstairs. See if you can find any notes or records telling us where he's buried. I'll just check down here.

SAM and MOLLY go upstairs. They find a room strewn with papers.

SAM
Great.
[he starts going through the papers; MOLLY finds an old scrapbook by the window and opens it]

MOLLY
Look at this.
[She takes the scrapbook to the bed and sits down. SAM joins her.]
It's Greeley and his wife.
[SAM turns a few pages]
It's a love letter he wrote her. My god, it's beautiful. I don't understand how a guy like this can turn into that monster.

SAM
Um ... Spirits like Greeley are, uh ... like wounded animals. Lost. In so much pain that ... they lash out.

MOLLY
Why? Why are they here?

SAM
Well, there's some part of them that... that's keeping them here. Like their remains or, um... unfinished business.

MOLLY
Unfinished business?

SAM
Yeah. Uh, it could be revenge. Could be love. Or hate. Whatever it is, they just hold on too tight. Can't let go. So they're trapped. Caught in the same loops. Replaying the same tragedies over and over.

MOLLY
You sound almost sorry for them.

SAM
Well, they weren't evil people, you know? A lot of them were good. Just... Something happened to them. Something they couldn't control.

DEAN
[from the doorway]
Sammy's always getting a little J. Love Hewitt when it comes to things like this. Me, I don't like 'em. And I sure as hell ain't making apologies for 'em. There's nothing downstairs. You find anything?

SAM
Uh, just about every piece of mail or receipt they ever had. Looked through a couple, but nothing about a grave so far.

DEAN investigates a wall.

SAM
What?

DEAN
There's something behind here.
[tosses his flashlight to SAM]
Here.
[moves a cabinet aside, revealing a small hidden door. He pokes at it]
It's locked from the inside.
[turning around, he throws a back kick at the door, which does nothing. He looks surprised, then braces himself and kicks harder. The door falls inward. They crawl through. Once in the room they brush away cobwebs to stand up.]
It smells like old lady in here.
[he finds a corpse hanging by the neck from the ceiling.]
And that would explain why. Well, now we know why nobody ever saw her again.

MOLLY
She didn't want to live without him.

SAM
[picking up a chair as if to take down the corpse]
Dean, give me a hand.

DEAN
Really?

MOLLY
What are you gonna do?

SAM
We can't leave her like this.

DEAN
Why not?

SAM
She deserves to be put to rest, Dean.

DEAN reluctantly agrees. SAM stands on the chair and begins to cut through the rope as DEAN steadies the corpse.

DEAN Son of a ... (at the smell, or the horribleness of holding a corpse)

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN dig a grave for Mrs. GREELEY.

MOLLY
So... So, if you manage to put Greeley to rest, too... What happens to them?

DEAN
Lady, that answer is way beyond our pay grade.

MOLLY
You hunt these things, but you don't know what happens to them?

DEAN
Well, they never come back. That's all that matters.

SAM
[seeing that this answer has not satisfied her]
After they let go of whatever's keeping them here, they ... they just go. I hope someplace better, but we don't know. No one does.

MOLLY
What happens when you burn their bones?

SAM
Umm... Well, my dad used to say that was like death for ghosts, you know? But... The truth is, we still don't know. Not for sure.
[looks at DEAN]
Guess that's why we all hold on to life so hard. Even the dead. We're all just scared of the unknown.

MOLLY
The only thing I'm scared of is losing David. I have to see him again. (long pause) I have to.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

MOLLY is pacing in one room, looking through the photo album; SAM and DEAN waiting in another room nearby.

SAM (sighs)
I think we should tell her about her husband.

DEAN
We can't.

SAM
Dean, it's cruel, letting her pine for him like this. I don't like keeping her in the dark.

DEAN
It's for her own good.
[gets up]
Man, I know you feel guilty, all right? But let's just stick to the plan. Let's get her out of here. Then we'll tell her.

MOLLY
[approaching]
Tell me what? What aren't you telling me? It's about David. You know what happened to him.

SAM
Molly--

DEAN
Sam, don't.

MOLLY
Don't what? Don't tell me because I'll mess up your hunt? You don't care about me or my husband.

SAM
That's not true.

MOLLY
Really? Then whatever it is, tell me, please.
SAM swallows, wanting to say something.
[They hear a radio turn on, static, then the song 'House of the Rising Sun' begin to play]

MOLLY
He's coming.

DEAN (to SAM)
Stay with her.

DEAN goes cautiously towards the sound. He uncovers the dusty radio that has powered itself on. He crouches down and finds a broken, frayed power cord. He hears another noise and goes toward the front door. It frosts over and the words 'SHE'S MINE' appear in the frost.

In the other room, MOLLY is standing by the window. SAM steps cautiously forward towards the next room. Suddenly a figure crashes through the window behind MOLLY and grabs her. She screams as she is dragged outside. DEAN comes running back.

SAM
He's got Molly!

They both leap through the window and chase them through the woods. They lose sight of them, and return to the house.

DEAN
This guy is persistent.

SAM
We gotta find Molly.

DEAN
We gotta find Greeley's bones. And, uh, no pressure or anything, but we got less than two hours before sunrise.

SAM
[looking through the photo album]
Hey.

DEAN
What do you got?

SAM
[reading the caption on a photograph]
'February 6, 1992.'

DEAN
That was like two weeks before the accident, wasn't it?

SAM
Yeah. I mean, it looks like the hunting cabin, but... I swear there's a tree there right where they're standing. (They both look up.) I should've thought of it.

DEAN
What?

SAM
It's an old country custom, Dean. Planting a tree as a grave marker.

DEAN
You're like a walking encyclopedia of weirdness.

SAM (somewhat bitterly)
Yeah. I know.

[they leave]

INT. HUNTING CABIN - NIGHT

MOLLY is hanging from the ceiling by her wrists.

MOLLY
Where's David? What did you do to him?

GREELEY
You shouldn't worry about him anymore.

MOLLY
Oh, my god.

GREELEY
You should worry about yourself.

MOLLY
I didn't do anything to you.

GREELEY
Oh?

MOLLY (groaning)
[as he runs a filthy hand over her face]
I know... I know about your wife. Hurting me won't bring her back.

GREELEY
My wife is gone. All I got left's ... hurting you.

[He slides a finger across her collarbone, slicing flesh; Molly screams.]

MOLLY
P-Please. Just let me go.

GREELEY
Go? You're not gonna leave. You're never ... gonna leave.

[He drags a finger across her belly, gouging deep. She screams in pain.]

SAM and DEAN approach the cabin from the outside, carrying shovels.

SAM
Go get Molly.

Aas DEAN heads inside, SAM begins to dig around the tree. Inside, GREELEY is approaching MOLLY menacingly when his head explodes in a shotgun burst, revealing DEAN behind him. MOLLY gasps.]

MOLLY
Oh, thank god.

DEAN (smiling)
Yeah, call me Dean.
[GREELEY appears behind DEAN, who turns to face him. GREELEY gestures and DEAN cries out, a cut appearing on his cheek.]
This guy's really pissing me off.

- GREELEY gestures again and DEAN flies backward, slamming against the wall.
- Outside, SAM digs feverishly. He hits something hard, looks down; it's bones. From inside we hear Dean yell, "Hurry up, Sam!"
- Inside, DEAN is still struggling against the wall. GREELEY reaches out, and a knife flies into his hand.
- SAM empties a box of salt into the open grave.
- GREELEY approaches DEAN with the knife. Greeley and Dean struggle.
- SAM empties a container of gasoline into the grave, lights a match and drops it in.
- GREELEY freezes and rears back in pain, screaming "No, no."
- The corpse in the grave catches fire and burns
- GREELEY bursts into flame, is consumed, and disappears. The knife falls to the floor.

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

DEAN, SAM, and MOLLY approach the IMPALA. DEAN pats it lovingly.

DEAN
Oh, baby, it's been a long night.

DEAN drops his bag in the back, then climbs into the driver's seat. SAM opens the back door for MOLLY.

SAM
All right. Let's get you out of here.

MOLLY
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what happened to my husband.

SAM
Molly...

MOLLY
All this time ... I've been looking for him, and you knew that... You knew that Greeley killed him, didn't you? He's dead.

SAM
No, Molly. David's alive.

MOLLY
What? You're sure?

SAM
I'm sure. We'll take you to him. Come on.

[smiling in relief, she gets in the car.]

EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

They pull up in front of a nice suburban home. The lights are on inside.

SAM
He's in that house, right there.

MOLLY
I don't understand.

SAM
You will.

[They get out. She approaches the window, and can see DAVID inside. He is older, wearing a bathrobe, and pouring a cup of coffee.]

MOLLY
That's ... not ... It can't be. (Sam and Dean are watching Molly. They look at each other.)
[DAVID looks up and a woman in a bathrobe comes up to him, kissing him on the lips.]
What's happening?
[turning back to SAM and DEAN]
Who is that?

SAM
That's David's wife. (Molly turns around to look at the house again, then back to Sam and Dean.) I'm sorry, Molly. 15 years ago, you and your husband hit Jonah Greeley with your car. David survived.

MOLLY
What are you saying?

DEAN
We're saying there isn't just one spirit haunting Highway 41. There are two. Jonah Greeley and you.

SAM
For the past 15 years, one night a year you've been appearing on that highway.

MOLLY
No, that's not possible. It was our anniversary ... February 22nd --

SAM
1992.

MOLLY
Yes.

DEAN
Molly, it's 2007.

MOLLY
Oh, god.

FLASHBACK - SAM AND DEAN POV, THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

DEAN
All right. Tell me about Highway 41.

SAM
12 accidents over 15 years. Five of them fatal, all of them happening on the same night.

DEAN
So what are we looking at ... Interstate dead zone? Phantom hitchhiker? What?

SAM
Not quite. Year after year, witnesses said the same thing made them crash. A woman appearing in the middle of the road, being chased by a man covered in blood.

DEAN
Two spooks?

CONTINUED FLASHBACK: INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN find old newspaper articles referring to MOLLY and JONAH'S deaths.

CONTINUED FLASHBACK: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

DEAN
Now, where is Molly buried?

DAVID
She... she wasn't buried anywhere. She was cremated.

CONTINUED FLASHBACK: EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

DEAN
So much for burning her bones.

SAM
Yeah, but then what's keeping her here?

CONTINUED FLASHBACK: MOLLY sees the events of the crash and the aftermath in flashes: David calling "Molly!" and Molly screaming as they crash.

SAM [present]
Some spirits only see what they want.

FLASHBACK: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

MOLLY
David?! David?

MOLLY runs out onto the road, stopping the IMPALA.

MOLLY
Stop! Stop! (Impala breaks. Dean yells, "Holy--") Molly: You have to help me!

SAM
Dean, I don't think she knows she's dead.

MOLLY
Please! (banging on Sam's car window) Open up! Please!

SAM
Okay, okay! All right, all right. Just calm down. Tell us what happened.

CONTINUED FLASHBACK: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

DEAN
What are you gonna tell her?

SAM
The truth?

DEAN
She's gonna take off running in the other direction.

CONTINUED FLASHBACK: INT. GREELEY'S HOUSE = NIGHT

SAM to MOLLY
Some spirits hold on too tight. Can't let go.

FLASHBACK ENDS

MOLLY
And Greeley?

SAM
Each year he punishes somebody for his death... ah, chasing them. Torturing them. And each year, that somebody is you.

MOLLY
But I don't remember any of it.

SAM
Because you couldn't see the truth, Molly.

MOLLY
So that's why he won't let me off the highway. Because... I killed him. I killed us both.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE

EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE - NEAR DAWN

MOLLY
[sitting on the steps]
Why didn't you tell me when you first saw me? Why wait until now?

DEAN
You wouldn't have believed us.

MOLLY (to Dean, accusingly)
And you needed me for bait.

SAM
Well, we needed you.

MOLLY
David.

SAM
Molly, we brought you here so you could move on.

MOLLY
I have to tell him --

SAM
Tell him what? That you love him? That you're sorry? Molly, he already knows that. Look, if you want to go in there, we're not gonna stop you.
DEAN
Yeah, but you are gonna freak him right out. For life.

SAM
David's already said his good byes, Molly. Now it's your turn. This is your unfinished business.

MOLLY
What am I supposed to do?

SAM
Just... let go. Of David. Of everything. You do that... we think you'll move on.

MOLLY (crying)
But you don't know where.

SAM
No. But Molly, you don't belong here. Haven't you suffered long enough? It's time. It's time to go.

[MOLLY nods sadly, then steps slowly away from the house. She turns her face upwards as the first light of dawn creeps over the rooftops. Bathed in light, she becomes part of the light and vanishes.]

DEAN
I guess she wasn't so bad... for a ghost. You think she's really going to a better place?

SAM
I hope so.

DEAN
I guess we'll never know. Not until we take the plunge ourselves, huh?

SAM
Doesn't really matter, Dean. Hope's kind of the whole point.

DEAN
All right, Haley Joel.
[smacks him in the shoulder]
Let's hit the road.

They cross the road and get back in the IMPALA as a light rain begins to fall.
