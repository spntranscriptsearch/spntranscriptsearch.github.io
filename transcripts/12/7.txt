TEASER

Interior : A week ago, Adam and Gordy are in Adam's basement attempting to summon Lucifer.


Adam: Dark Lord.


Gordy: Apollyon.


Adam: Beelzebub. As your humble servants, we beseech thee. We say your names as summonings. Show thyself! Serpent.


Gordy: Devil.


Adam: Lucifer! Show thyself! Rain your splendor upon me. Let me bathe in your unholy wrath.


Gordy stifles a laugh.


Adam: Drench me, Lucifer.


Gordy trying to hide that he is laughing at Adam


Adam: Cut it out, Gordy.


Gordy bluntly laughs at Adam about what he's summoning.


Adam: Dude, it's not funny.


Gordy: (Switch clicks, song stops). Dude, you asked Lucifer


to drench you.


Adam: I didn't write it, okay? It's a Satanist Society of America-approved summoning. I found it online.


Gordy: Yeah, like you found that "artifact." Face it, Adam,


your "Satan feather" is faker than my stepmom's Chinatown Fendi.


Adam: It's real.


Gordy: It's a rock.


Adam: Well, it's fossilized. A feather from Lucifer's wing. The seller excavated it from one of his crypts.


Gordy: Lucifer has "crypts." Lucifer has "wings." You're so frickin' dumb.


Vince Vincente: Actually… I've been looking for that.


Gordy: No way! No freakin' –


Vince snap Gordy’s neck.


Adam: Aah!


Vince Vincente: Hiya.


Adam: You're… I-it worked! My summoning actually –


Vince Vincente: The only thing that "summoned" me was this. (getting the fossilized feather from Adam) This vessel was already wearing out, and my trip under the sea did not help. With a little power up… (put the fossilized feather to his

chest)[Whoosh] (suddenly Vince glows and heals himself)


Adam: (Adam using his cape cover his face because of sudden glow of light)


Vince Vincente: Hey. Won't last long, but it'll do. So, uh, you and your...pal, are you typical of my following on Earth these days? 'Cause...oof.


Adam: No, no, no, no, no, no. You can't be Lucifer. You're Vince Vincente. My mom loves you. You're...kinda famous.


Then Vince also snaps Adam's neck.


Vince Vincente: Huh. Kinda famous.


TITLE CARD


ACT 1

Interior: At the Bunker Dean is playing Words with Mary


Dean: "Twerking." Booyah. [Beeping]


Mary sent a message “That CAN’T be a word.”


Dean while smiling sent a message “Check the dictionary. Devil Emoji”


SAM WALKS IN, CATCHES DEAN AND IS ANNOYED THAT DEAN HAS BEEN GOOFING OFF WHILE HE HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR LUCIFER AS WELL AS KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR CASES.


Dean: Ah.


Sam: Seriously?


Dean: What?


Sam: So I've been trying to dig up info on the British Men of Letters, keeping an eye out for cases, and you've been goofing off with a game that went out of style five years ago?


Dean: I don't think Mom's quite ready for Snapchat.


Sam: You're playing against Mom?


Dean: Yeah.


Sam: The same Mom that didn't know what a cellphone was a month ago?


Dean: Yeah.


Sam: Doesn't exactly seem like a fair fight.


MARY WON THE GAME AGAINST DEAN.


Dean: (with a dismayed face and showing Sam his phone that Mary won!) You were saying?


Sam: Huh! [Chuckles] So how she been lately?


Dean: She's good. You know, she – she's dealing.


WHILE THEY ARE TALKING THEY GET A CALL FROM CASTIEL


Dean: Hey, Cass.


Castiel: Hello, Dean. (while sitting at the bar)


Dean: You still living out an '80s buddy comedy with Crowley?


Castiel: Unfortunately.


Sam: Any news on Lucifer? [Cellphone chiming] While Sam is reading the news about Vince Vincente


Castiel: Actually, yes. Look at the news.


Sam: One sec. [Clears throat] [Tapping keys]( Sam uses his laptop to open news about Vince Vicente.) No way. So this is from today.


They watch the news where a reporter interviews Vince Vicente.


Reporter: We're here in front of Death Siren Records...


Dean: Oh, no friggin' way....with Vince Vincente.


Vince Vincente: Yes, it's, uh, it's great having the band back together again. In the studio, feeling pumped. Haven't felt this fired up in ages.


Reporter: A lot of people saying that your style of rock could never make a comeback in today's landscape. What do you say to them?


Vince Vincente: Go to hell.


Dean: – Tell me that's not Lucifer.


Castiel: – We don't know.


Sam: Cass, I-I thought you said Rowena got some licks in. Shouldn't he have burned through his vessel by now?


Castiel: Yeah, but we don't know. We don't –


Suddenly Crowley takes the cellphone from Castiel and turns on speakerphone.


Crowley: Hello, boys. Long time. We team up to save the world, and then bupkis. You don't call, you don't write.


Dean: Yeah, we don't care.


Sam: Crowley – Lucifer.


Crowley: Lucifer. Think about it. Of all the extinct rock acts, Ladyheart are the most Paleolithic. A major label sponsored comeback in 2016 for those dinosaurs? It doesn't feel like a wholly natural turn of events, does it?


Castiel: Maybe Lucifer found a way to heal his vessel.


Dean: Yeah, but still...I mean, what the hell?


Crowley: He's in L.A. I'll see you there. [Beep] (Hangs up the phone)


Dean: Oh, L.A.


Sam: Yeah.


Suddenly Crowley puts on his sunglasses.


Castiel: Where are you going?


Crowley: I know a guy.


Interior: Crowley visits associate Russell Lemmons at Death Siren recording studio to get some information about Vince Vincente.


When Crowley suddenly appears, Russell is sitting in a chair while holding a glass of wine in his left hand and looking at a trophy in his right hand. Russell is meditating.


Crowley: Hello, Russell.


Russell: Brother Crowley. One moment. Just let me tie this off real quick. All right! [Claps hands] So… what brings you to the City of...[chuckles] Angels?


Crowley: You know this is my city.


Russell: Ha!


Crowley: What's with all this Maharishi crap?


Russell: I moved to the Westside last year. Started daily meditation, yoga, green juice. Helps to keep the ego and the anger in check. But enough about me. How you been, huh? Health? Family? Hell?


Crowley: Doesn't matter, don't care, and been better.


Russell: Well, good news. Good news. I got a couple of quality up-and-comers for you. Thirsty young talent. Souls ripe for the taking. You have been pleased with our...arrangement so far?


Crowley: Oh, as punch. A soul's a soul. Mm. But there is a certain prestige to owning a Swift or a Drake.


Russell: Ah. You like that? It's a gift from Dre.


Crowley: This whole Vince Vincente comeback thing… It's a joke, right? Russell: No. Deadly serious, my friend. We've raided, repackaged, and resold everything else from our past. Why not give hair metal another shot? Yeah, okay. I doubted it, too, but Vince came to me with a killer pitch. The original Ladyheart lineup reunited. Back in the day, those cats sold, like, 10 mil.


Crowley: So did Hootie & the Blowfish.


Russell: And I'll bring them back, too. I know Ladyheart might be a punch line, but the band's got off-the-chart name recognition. And just talking to Vince, he seemed different, you know? Energized. Reborn. Lit.


Crowley: Like a whole new man.


Russell: Exactly.


Exterior: Dean and Sam are riding in the impala heading to L.A.


Dean: All right. 450 miles to L.A. Land of gridlock, Botox, overtaxing, underachieving, smell of sweaty desperation. I mean, you can't breathe. The beaches are toxic. You got dudes in skinny jeans wearing sunglasses inside. [Sighs] Oh.

Image-obsessed narcissists. I do like the yoga pants, though. [Chuckles] When was the last time we were in L.A.? About 10 years ago, doing a vengeful spirit? Man, that seems like forever ago. Doesn't it? Hey. [Hits arm] Tryin' to talk to you

here.


Sam: What?


Dean: You...What are you listenin' to?


Sam: Uh, podcast. Why?


Dean: All right, well… I need something to keep me awake, so crank it up.


Sam: I mean, it's a history podcast. [Clears throat]


Dean: Well, I like history, you know? Gladiators and outlaws, pirates. Hell, we're driving a piece of history right here.


Sam: N-not that kind of history. This is a, uh… [Clears throat] it's a podcast on the history of the Protestant Reformation. A multipart exploration of each of Martin Luther's 95 theses.


Dean: Oh.


Sam: Yeah, that's what I thought. [Clears throat]


Dean unplugs his earphones to hear "The Bloody Messiah"


Dean: Ohh, Sam.


Sam: Dude.


Dean: Hair rock? Really?


Sam: It's not hair –


Dean: Come on.


Sam: It's not hair rock, Dean. It's hard rock. It's legitimate hard rock.


Dean: [Chuckles] Wow.


Sam: Don't judge a book by its cover.


Dean: Yeah, or a dude by his, uh, rainbow wig and leopard prints.


Sam: Rainbow wig? What? You know what? I'm done apologizing. Lucifer possessed Vince Vincente. This is Vince Vincente's music, so listening to it is research.


Dean: No. No.


Sam: As a matter of fact… [Raises volume] Study up, Dean.


Dean: No, no. No. I don't wanna listen to it.


Sam: You like it.


Dean: No. No. No, no. No. Turn it off.


Sam: It'll grow on ya. [Clears throat]


The music keeps playing as they continue down the road



Interior: Inside the sound booth of Death Siren Recording Studio.


Manager: Your tweet about Ladyheart's reunion already has over a million engagements. When you were solo, you were lucky to have 300 "likes." The band's teaser track on SoundCloud? 500K streams in 4 hours. [Guitar and bass tuning] (Vince Vincente’s face is happy, and Roseleen is very excited about the news.) Buzzfeed just posted a listicle – "10 Things You Need to Know About Ladyheart." This is good, Vince. This is really good.


Vince Vincente: Great.


Roseleen: It's happening, Vince. I mean, we are gonna be famous again.


Tommy steps in the room to talk to Vince.


Tommy: Vince. So, we actually gonna record or what?


Vince Vincente: Hmm. Not really feelin' it.


Tommy: Come on, man. The band's back together. We've got an actual recording budget. Dude... [Whispers] let's make some music.


Vince Vincente: Music. What are the fans saying about me right now?


Manager: They're tweeting about your drinks with Pam Anderson last night, speculating if you two are rekindling. And they're debating whether Vince Vincente is bae, nay, or daddy.


Tommy: What the hell does that even mean?


Vince Vincente: It means it's not about the music. It never really was. You know, rock's not the reason. It's just an excuse...to worship, to adore. See, humans have always been desperate to put someone or something above them. And let's face it, God ain't cuttin' it these days. It takes a Kim Kardashian, a whatever Justin Bieber is. A me. They're enjoying the ride. So should you.


Tommy left the room dismayed about what Vince Vincente said.



Interior: Inside the Bellaqua hotel lobby


Sam and Dean are waiting in the lobby of the hotel for Crowley and Castiel. Sam gets a water from the dispenser. Dean gives him a look.


Sam: What? It's good.


Dean: It's vegetable water.


Castiel: Sam, Dean.


Dean: Hey. You consider switching up your duds there? Bit stiff for this town.


Sam: He could be an agent or something.


Dean: Yeah, maybe a third-tier agent.


Castiel: At least I don't look like a lumberjack.


Sam: Okay, enough. Guys, where's Crowley?


Castiel: He said he'd meet us here. Frankly, I appreciate the break. It's been weeks, and he's been right there, just talking and talking and talking. It's relentless.


Crowley approaches Castiel from behind.


Crowley: Don't listen to him. [Sighs] Feathers and I are all but inseparable now.


Sam: You find anything?


Crowley: Yes. Vince Vincente is riding with the Devil.


Castiel: Okay, so what now?


Crowley shows a keycard for Vince Vicente’s room.


Crowley: I suggest we go check out his room. Vince is scheduled to be in the studio all day, so we're covered.


Dean: How'd you get the card?


Crowley: This is L.A. I know a lot of people.


Using the card from the receptionist, Castiel, Crowley, Sam, and Dean enter Vince Vicente’s room.


Castiel: Well, looks like there was some kind of a fight.


Dean: Mm. Yeah. Some kind.


Sam: Look at this. Rock star biographies. Like, all of them, from Aerosmith to ZZ Top. It's like he's studying how to become famous.


Dean: Well, so what, Lucifer's a dork?


Sam: That's good to know.


Castiel: Look at this – "The seeds of a ripe dragon fruit drizzled with exactly 1 ounce of Acacia honey, prepared in a ceramic bowl – no plastic." What is this spell?


Crowley: It's breakfast. It's Vince's rider. I've seen worse.


Sam: I don't get it. Lucifer could be taking over Heaven and Hell right now, and instead, he's trying to act out some rock god fantasy?


Dean: Yeah. Who wouldn't? [Strikes strings]


Castiel: I found something.


Sam: What is that?


Castiel: It appears to be a human tooth pulled out by the root.



Interior: Inside the room of Death Siren Studio.


Roseleen: Can I ask you something? Why are you spending time with me? You ignored me for years, not that I blamed you.


Vince Vincente: I was a fool not to recognize such sweet devotion.


Roseleen is hiding her smile smiling because of what she heard from Vince.


Vince Vincente: Talk to me, Roseleen. Tell me about...me.


Roseleen: [Sighs] You're Vince. Vince Vincente. And I knew I was in love with you the moment I saw you. I was 16, just a normal kid


growing up in Arcadia.


Vince Vincente: Arcadia. Sounds beautiful.


Roseleen: I was watching "Headbanger's Ball" and the "Bloody Messiah"


video came on. And I... [Sighs] Oh. It was your voice. And your hair. And your eyes. It was everything. You were everything. And even when people made fun of me – younger girls at work, shredding on my Ladyheart tattoos and saying you're a joke – I never stopped loving you. And I never will.


Vince Vincente: How much do you love me? What would you do to show me?


Roseleen: Anything.


Vince Vincente set down the glass on the table.


Vince Vincente: Anything? (leaning to get a knife out of his pocket) Would you bleed?


Roseleen nodded, but looked afraid.


Vince Vincente: Then bleed.


Roseleen takes the blade and begins carving Vince Vincente’s name into her chest. Roseleen starts to scream and Lucifer smiles while he looks on.



ACT 2

Interior: Inside the hospital


Doctor: Mrs. Greenfield has lost a lot of blood and there'll be no fixing those scars, but she's stable.


Castiel: And she cut herself?


Doctor: She carved his name into her chest. "Vince Vincente." Didn't skip a letter. And she cut deep.


Dean: Thanks, Doctor. Well, again, what the hell?


Crowley: I'll go talk to her.


Sam: No. No, no, no, you won't.


Dean: Cass, stay here. Keep an eye on him.


Crowley: Well...together again.


Castiel: Yay.



Interior: Sam and Dean are inside Rosaleen’s hospital room, talking to her about her injuries.


Dean: We wanna understand what happened, but in order for us to do that, we need you to talk.


Sam: Roseleen, did Vince force you to do this?


Roseleen: No. Vince didn't. He wouldn't have to. I wanted to, to show him, to make him happy.


Dean: You ever stop and wonder what kind of sicko gets happy off of watching somebody melonball their own flesh?


Roseleen: Don't talk about Vince like that. He had a reason, a good reason. He must have. I'm sure he can explain everything. If I could just see him – Ah!


Roseleen tried to stand forgetting that she has wound in her chest.


Roseleen: I need to get to the show. Please! Please!



Interior: Inside Death Siren Recording Studio


Manager: Okay, we're building an aura of mystery and exclusivity with tonight's show – undisclosed location, small, select audience. It's as much about who doesn't get a ticket as who does. This could push


your social media profile to Kimye levels.


Vince Vincente: Who gets the tickets?


Manager: It's an online lottery of local fans, but it'll tend towards


the Ladyheart diehards. They'll be more engaged –


Vince Vincente: I've had my fill of the diehards. They already love me. Religion, celebrity, Twitter – it's all the same rules. If you're not gaining followers, you're losing followers. I want a different crowd tonight. New fans.


Manager: Look, getting a new audience is great for social media visibility, which is great for overall buzz, but they're fickle. They don't spend any money on music. They have no loyalty. Good luck translating their attention to album or ticket sales.


Vince Vincente: I don't care. [Whispers] I want fresh blood.


Manager: Got it.



Interior: Inside the hospital after talking to Roseleen. Sam and Dean inform Crowley and Castiel about the upcoming concert.


Castiel: So the show is tonight?


Sam: That's what she said.


Castiel: Can Lucifer even sing or play an instrument?


Dean: I doubt they offer intro to guitar in the cage.


Crowley: Like it matters. What Lucifer made that woman do has got nothing to do with music. It's about devotion.


Dean: Come again?


Crowley: You little people wouldn't understand, but I've been a king. Having people look at you like you're everything, knowing that once they buy in, you can make them do anything, it's intoxicating.


Dean: Well, that's super creepy.


Castiel: Okay, so this concert, all these people, what is – what is Lucifer planning to do?


Sam: Nothing good.


Castiel: Is Rowena –


Crowley: Dear Mother says that once we catch Lucifer, she'll show, no sooner.


Dean: Well, without Rowena, we're outgunned.


Crowley: With her, we're outgunned.


Sam: It doesn't matter, guys. This is our shot. We just gotta find out


where he's playing tonight.


Dean: All right, let's get to work.



Interior: Inside Death Siren Studio, Russell’s Office.


Russell: A mystery to even me. Though, even if I did know, I probably wouldn't tell you.


Crowley: You'd threaten our very lucrative partnership for one over-the-hill, bad dye job rock dinosaur?


Russell: I'm smelling money with Vince, bruh. This is business, Crowley. It's nothing personal.


Crowley used his hand to drag Russell to the wall and the drink splashes into the floor. Russell is scared and has started panting.


Crowley: No, believe me, it's personal.



Exterior: Outside Death Siren Studio. In the pathway, Castiel is talking to Tommy to try and find out where the show is.


Castiel: Tommy.


Tommy: Guys, I'll meet you inside. Agent. What are you doing here, man?


Castiel: Investigating Vince, same as before. You hear what happened


to Roseleen?


Tommy: Yeah, that was, uh, it was awful. But, I mean, come on, man,


she cut herself, right? It wasn't like...


Castiel: You know that's not the whole truth. You know Vince isn't Vince.



Interior: Inside a restaurant, Sam and Dean are talking to Vince’s Manager.


Dean: We're the brothers that rock together. Hmm? We're kind of like the American Oasis.


Manager: Ew.


Sam: Uh, uh, but with synths.


Dean: Yeah, right, so, you know, we're – we're hip.


Sam: Exactly.


Manager: Who plays what? [Sighs]


Sam: I'm on keys. He's on the drums.


Dean: Guitar. Drums and guitar. I pretty much do it all. [Chuckles]


Sam: We saw online that you represent Vince Vincente. We were kind of hoping you could do for us what you've done for him.


Manager: [Sighs] Sorry. I took this meeting 'cause you looked hot in your pics, but I am not feeling this.


Dean: Okay, you know what? We're not actually here for a meeting.


Sam: Vince's show tonight – where is it?


Manager: Who are you guys?


Sam: Look, you must've noticed, Vince is different.



Interior: Crowley is still in Russell’s office, forcing him to leak where Vince Vincente’s concert.


Russell: I...don't know!


Crowley: You're messing with hellfire, Russell. You will find out where that show is. You will tell me or I will end you.


Russell is threatened by what Crowley said and begun to exhales, breathing heavily.


Russell: Oh. [Gasps] [Intercom beeps] Brigitta, get me another green juice in here. Namaste.



Exterior: Castiel is asking Tommy to tell where is the concert.


Castiel: Where's the show, Tommy?


Tommy: Man, I don't know what the hell's going on with Vince, all right? All the royalties on our hits dried up years ago. I got two daughters in college. I know what I told you and I know what I saw, but...


Castiel: And you don't care who pays the price?


Tommy: Sorry.



Interior: Sam and Dean are asking the Manager to tell where the concert will be held.


Manager: Vince gives me the skeeves, but he's a playing client.


Dean: No, he's the Devil.


Sam: Yeah, like, literally.


Manager: [Chuckles] I'm in P.R. I've worked for sexists, racists, even politicians. My job is making saints out of devils. No way I'm threatening my reputation by working against his interests. So you need to take a step back or I start

screaming. And in a crowded place like this? Girl like me, two guys like you… Guess what happens next? Buh-bye.



Interior: Lobby of Bellaqua Hotel


Dean: And you said you put the fear in Russell.


Crowley: I thought I had. These yoga types. Just when you think you've harshed their mellow...


Sam: Yeah, well, I've been looking everywhere online, and, uh… [Scoffs] no one's linked the venue yet. Seriously?


Dean: What?


Sam: Dude.


Dean: Shut up.


Sam: Cass.


Dean: Anything?


Castiel: No.


Dean: So we couldn't flip a single member of Vince's team. Even with the threat of mass murder, these SoCal douchebags won't do the right thing.


Crowley: Welcome to Los Angeles.


Castiel: So what happens now?



Interior: Inside the Limo where the event happen.


Manager: [Scoffs] I've never seen so many crying emojis in my life.


The people who didn't get in, they're rending garments all over Twitter. Gossip blogs, social media, they're on fire speculating


about the secret reunion show.


Vince Vincente: And the winners?


Manager: Thrilled.


Tommy: Be more thrilled if we had new music to sell.


Russell: What?


Tommy: [Inhales deeply] Well, Vince was a no-show at the studio. Again.


Vince Vincente: The muse – guess she took a powder. Relax, Russell. Tonight's show? It's gonna kill.


Russell: I took a chance on you, Vince. An aging, well-past-his-prime


Buttrocker. You will get in line.


Vince Vincente: Or?


Russell: Or I take it all back. Huh?


Tommy: Whoa.


Russell: Eh. Check your contract for it. You don't do what I say, I can bury Ladyheart. I own you.


Vince Vincente: Do you?


Russell: Yeah.


Vince Vincente points his finger to Russell’s pen.


Vince Vincente: [Chuckles] (Smiling while forcing Russell to stab himself with a pen.)


Russell: What's happening here? Hey, man.


Tommy: Vince, what are you doing?


Russell: Hey, man. Hey!


Tommy: Vince, stop!


Russell: Hey!


Tommy: Vince!


Russell: [Strained voice] Hey. [Squish] (the pen went straight to his throat.)


Vince Vincente: Well… [Gasping] See you all inside. [Car door opens] (as he goes out on the limo to see his fans.)


Woman: Whoo!


Man: Yeah! Vince! Vince!


Fans: [Cheering, whistling][Laughing evilly]


Vince Vincente: Who's ready to have fun?


Woman: Vince, I love you!


Man: Hey! Vince!


Manager: [Sighs](while stepping out of the Limo.)


Woman: Thank you! I love you, Vince!


Manager: I quit.


While Vince Vincente is entering the club, the fans take pictures of him.



ACT 3

Interior: Inside the Club Meteor, the staff prepares for the show. Tommy sends a text to Castiel, giving him the location of the show.


Castiel: Guys.


Castiel informs Dean, Sam, and Crowley that Tommy sent a text about the location of the show. The fan who have tickets start entering the bar.


Castiel: Ugh. Tommy's still not answering.


Dean: Well, he got us here. That's what matters. [Car door closes]


Crowley: Enochian handcuffs. That's your move?


Castiel: They held me.


Crowley: You're not him.


Dean: We have no sure bets here, okay? Anything that we use is gonna be like popping BBs.


Crowley: Oh, great pep talk. Go, team.


Sam: Guys, we're here to do more than just take a shot at Lucifer.


Crowley: We are?


Sam:Yes, we need to save the people inside, too.


Castiel: I'll take Lucifer. He's my responsibility.


Sam: No, he's not. He's all of our responsibility.


Castiel: Well, the only way you'll clear that crowd without drawing fire is if he's otherwise engaged.


Dean: Engaged in what, Cass? Killing you?


Sam: Cass, you'll last...three minutes tops.


Castiel: Then I'll buy you three minutes.


Crowley: Make it four. What? I help.


Crowley chimes in and tells them he'll help them, much to Sam and Dean's surprise.



Interior: Backstage of Meteor Club


Band Mates 1: [Laughs] Have you seen that crowd? Man, I have not seen an audience this hyped since we headlined Monsters of Rock in '91, man.


Band Mates 2: No.


Band Mates 1: And the girls?


Band Mates 2: Mm-hmm?


Band Mates 1: Perfect age.


Band Mates 2: Ooh.


Band Mates 1: Tommy? [Snaps fingers] You okay? [Man chuckles] Our fearless leader.


Vince Vincente is approaching, and he snaps the neck of his 2 band mates.


Vince Vincente: How you feelin' about the show, Tommy?


Tommy is speechless with fear after watching Vince kill their bandmates.


Vince Vincente: Yeah. Me, too. [Whispers] The nerves. [Plays off-key chords] Whoops! Guess I should've practiced before tonight. [Sets down guitar] Or, you know, ever.


Tommy: Who are you?


Vince Vincente: Who I was… well, that doesn't matter. Who I am? Well, I'm Vince Vincente, rock god. And after careful deliberation, I've decided to cut the dead weight. [Whispers] I'm going solo.


Before Vince can snap his finger, Castiel arrives and stops him by holding his left hand.


Vince Vincente: Castiel.


Vince pushes Castiel back to remove his hands.


Castiel: Aah!


Vince Vincente: Took you long enough. Did you bring the rest of the Little Rascals?


Crowley: Just me.


Vince Vincente: Spanky.


In the audience, Sam and Dean go to the crowd to find ways to stop the show.


Sam: Sorry.


Sam sees the emergency fire switch and gestures his plan to Dean.


Dean: Hey, you guys – you guys smell smoke?


Fans: One, two, three! Vince! Vince!


Vince Vincente: Did not take you for the martyr type, Crowley.


Crowley: I'm really not. I just hate you that much.


Crowley wave his hand to drag Vince to the wall.


Crowley: What are you doing, Lucifer? You mean nothing to those kids out there. You think they'd draw blood for you? By choice?


Vince Vincente: Well… I thought I'd at least ask. And if they won't give it up by choice, maybe I'll just take it.


Castiel: Why?


Vince Vincente: Because it's fun. Because I can. And because being Lucifer? So much Judeo-Christian baggage. But Vince? He's famous. Everybody loves him.


Then Vince wave also his hand and drags Crowley to the wall.


Crowley: Uhh!


Vince Vincente: And I need love. I had a really jacked childhood. Hey, Tommy.


Before Tommy escape in the room Vince snaps his neck.


Castiel: You think this is fun?


Vince Vincente: Oh, I wouldn't expect you to understand. I was inside you. I know what a weak, duty-bound…


Castiel attempts to attack again but he is swiftly knocked aside by Lucifer


Vince Vincente: ...pleasureless dullard you are.


Castiel: – Aah!


Vince Vincente: And you. Bad doggy. Sit!


Lucifer turns to Crowley to smash him with his guitar.


Crowley: Ow! Uhh!


Meanwhile, in the crowd. Dean continues to question if anyone smells the smoke.


Dean: No, seriously, I-I-I think I smell smoke, everyone.


Man: Sure you're not having a stroke?


Dean: Hey, I'm serious. We need to get out of here.


Man: – Step off, dad.


Dean: – Hey, listen to me. We've got to go, okay?


Man: What's your problem, man? Get off me!


Dean: We gotta – All right, yeah.


Man: Get this guy off me!


Dean: No, listen to me, okay? Listen, we gotta get out of here.


Man: What's your problem, old man?


Dean: Okay. All right, yeah.


Security guard forces Dean to break it up.


Dean: Okay. Look, we gotta get everybody out of here.


Sam to pulls the emergency fire switch. [Alarm ringing]


Man: Fire!


At the sound of the fire alarm, Lucifer looks up from smashing Crowley with the guitar.


Vince Vincente: Clever girls.


Lucifer waves his hand to stop the alarm and to start the music. The "Bloody Messiah" plays again and crowds go back inside.


Sam: No. No, no, no, no, no. [Grunts]


Dean: Oh, no.


Lucifer continues to smash Crowley with his guitar and stop. He looks at Castiel, who is trying to get on his knees.


Vince Vincente: Stick around for the afterparty.


Then Vince Vincente takes the stage.


Vince Vincente: Hello, L.A.!


The crowd start to cheer for Vince.



ACT 4

Interior: Vince/Lucifer step in the stage to see all the crowds waiting for him. He was amazed that lot of people has come to the show of Vince.


Vince Vincente: What a crowd!


Woman: I love you, Vince!


Vince Vincente: Look at all those fresh, new faces. Everyone excited?


Fans are clapping and cheering for Vince.


Vince Vincente: Yeah, you should be! Tonight's not gonna be a typical show. Tonight, you're gonna see and feel things you never saw or felt before.


Fans: Yeah!


Vince Vincente: Things might get a little bit messy.


Fans continue cheering.


Vince smiles.


Dean: Ah, screw it.


Dean fires a gun at the ceiling.


Fans start to scream.


Fans: He's got a gun!


The crowd starts heading to the exit.


Sam: We gotta go! We gotta go! Go, go! Come on, guys!


Sam keeps yelling at the crowd to get everyone out faster.


Vince tries to stop the crowd by closing the door.


Sam try to stop to close the door so that everybody can go out.


Sam: No, no. No, no, no. [Grunts] Go! [Strained voice] Go. [Grunting] [Groans]


When the last person escape, Lucifer is able to slam the doors shut, trapping Sam and Dean with him.


Vince Vincente: Nuh-uh-uh.


Suddenly, Castiel appears on the stage and attacks Lucifer by smashing his face with a guitar.


Castiel: Hey, assbutt. [Grunts]


Castiel is easily deflected. Dean takes the stage and places the binding handcuffs on Lucifer,


Vince Vincente: Hi, Dean.


Lucifer simply throws Dean off the stage and shrugs the cuffs off.


Vince Vincente: Sam. Enjoy the show? [Sizzling] Mm, guys, you know I could end you all with a snap of my finger? Why would I do that when you can't do anything...


Castiel: (trying to stab Lucifer with the angel blade but Lucifer stop him) [Groans] Uhh!


Vince Vincente: ...to me?


Dean: Why are you doing this?


Vince Vincente: [Chuckles] Why?


Sam: You and God made up. You forgave him. What would he think?


Vince Vincente: I'm not especially interested in his opinion. Dear old dad, he finally apologized for abandoning me. And what's the very next thing he does? [Voice breaks] He ditches me. [Laughs] And you, too, by the way. And rides off

into the sunset with Auntie Amara. He needed my help, and he'd say anything to get it. His words, your words, they mean nothing. Don't you get it? This is all meaningless. Heaven, Hell, this world. If it ever meant anything, that moment is past.

Nothing down here but a bunch of hopeless distraction addicts, so filled with emptiness, so desperate to fill up the void… they don't mind being served another stale rerun of a rerun of a rerun. You know what my plan is? I don't have one. I'm

just gonna keep on smashing Daddy's already broken toys and make you watch.


Sam: Yeah? 'Cause it kinda looks like you're falling apart.


Dean: Yeah, you got a little something, uh, right there. I mean, face it, rock is dead.


Vince Vincente: What can I say? Kicking your ass took a lot out of me. But don't worry. Onward and upward.


Lucifer escapes leaving Vince's body, which drops to the floor and continues to deteriorate until his face caves in.



ACT 5

Exterior: In the street.


Sam, Castiel, and Crowley are standing outside the car while waiting for Dean to close the trunk. Crowley has been beaten badly by Lucifer, and his right eye is swollen.


Dean: How you feelin'?


Castiel: I'm not dead.


Dean: Well, I gotta hand it to you. You said you were gonna draw


Lucifer's fire and you drew some serious fire.


Crowley: Oh, it was a grand success.


Dean: Well, we didn't catch Lucifer, but we did save the crowd,


so I'm gonna call that a win.


Sam: I wouldn't. Vince Vincente is dead.


Dean: We never even hoped to save him. And, yes, I know, the third album –


Sam: No, he was still a person, and he meant something to a lot of people. And Lucifer just took all that and just twisted all that up and snuffed it out. Lucifer was bad enough when he had a plan, a motive. Now he's just having fun. I mean,

how many people died tonight? Them, this, it's all on us. We let him out. We're not winning. We're just losing slow. And you heard what he said.


Crowley: Onwards and upwards. He's gone big.


Castiel: And he'll go bigger.


Dean: And we will stop him. We will. It's what we do, man.
