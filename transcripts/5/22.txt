ACT ONE
Voiceover by CHUCK:

On April 21, 1967, the 100 millionth GM vehicle rolled off the line at the plant in Janesville – a blue two-door Caprice.

There was a big ceremony, speeches. The lieutenant governor even showed up. Three days later, another car rolled off that same line. No one gave two craps about her. But they should have, because this 1967 Chevrolet Impala would turn out to be the most important car – no, the most important object – in pretty much the whole universe.

She was first owned by Sal Moriarty, an alcoholic with two ex-wives and three blocked arteries. On weekends, he'd drive around giving Bibles to the poor "gettin' folks right for Judgment Day." That's what he said. Sam and Dean don't know any of this, but if they did, I bet they'd smile.

After Sal died, she ended up at Rainbow Motors, a used-car lot in Lawrence, where a young marine bought her on impulse. That is, after a little advice from a friend. I guess that's where this story begins.

And here's where it ends.

EXT. BOBBY'S SALVAGE YARD – DAY

SAM sits on the hood of the IMPALA drinking a beer. DEAN joins him.

SAM: Hey.

DEAN takes a beer out of a cooler and leans against the IMPALA.

SAM: Dean? What's going on?

DEAN: I'm in.

SAM: In with...?

DEAN: The whole "up with Satan" thing. I'm on board.

SAM: You're gonna let me say yes?

DEAN: No. That's the thing. It's not on me to let you do anything. You're a grown – well, overgrown – man. If this is what you want, I'll back your play.

SAM: That's the last thing I thought you'd ever say.

DEAN: Might be. I'm not gonna lie to you, though. It goes against every fiber I got. I mean, truth is... You know, watching out for you... it's kinda been my job, you know? But more than that, it's... it's kinda who I am. You're not a kid anymore, Sam, and I can't keep treating you like one. Maybe I got to grow up a little, too. I don't know if we got a snowball's chance. But... But I do know that if anybody can do it... it's you.

SAM: Thank you.

DEAN: If this is what you want... Is this really what you want?

SAM: I let him out. I got to put him back in.

DEAN: Okay. That's it, then.


SUPERNATURAL Title Card


INT. BUILDING – DAY

Bodies hang upside down over a devil's trap. SAM wipes blood off a large knife. CASTIEL puts the lid on a jug of blood. DEAN stands nearby.

EXT. BUILDING – DAY

SAM, CASTIEL and DEAN exit the building. SAM and CASTIEL carry gallon jugs of blood and put them in the trunk of the IMPALA. DEAN walks over to BOBBY.

DEAN: I still can't get used to you at eye level.

BOBBY: So, was I right?

DEAN: As always, Yoda. Two stunt demons inside, just like you said.

BOBBY: Did you get it?

DEAN: Yeah, all the "go juice" Sammy can drink.

BOBBY: You okay?

DEAN: Not really. What do you got?

BOBBY: Not much. These look like omens to you? [He hands DEAN a newspaper.] Cyclone in Florida, temperature drop in Detroit, wildfires in L.A.

DEAN: Wait. What about Detroit?

BOBBY: Temp's dropped about 20 degrees, but only in a five-block radius of downtown Motown.

DEAN: That's the one. Devil's in Detroit.

BOBBY: Really? As far as foreboding goes, it's a little light in the loafers. You sure?

DEAN: Yeah, I'm sure.

EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

The IMPALA drives down the road.

INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN is driving, SAM riding shotgun. CASTIEL is asleep in the back seat.

DEAN: Aw. Ain't he a little angel?

SAM: Angels don't sleep.

DEAN: Sam, I got a bad feeling about this.

SAM: Well, you'd be nuts to have a good feeling about it.

DEAN: You know what I mean. Detroit. He always said he'd jump your bones in Detroit. Here we are.

SAM: Here we are.

DEAN: Maybe this is him rolling out the red carpet, you know? Maybe he knows something that we don't.

SAM: Dean, I'm sure he knows a buttload we don't. We just got to hope he doesn't know about the rings. Hey, um... on the subject, there's something I got to talk to you about.

DEAN: What?

SAM: This thing goes our way and I...Triple Lindy into that box... y-you know I'm not coming back.

DEAN: Yeah, I'm aware.

SAM: So you got to promise me something.

DEAN: Okay. Yeah. Anything.

SAM: You got to promise not to try to bring me back.

DEAN: What? No, I didn't sign up for that.

SAM: Dean --

DEAN: Your Hell is gonna make my tour look like Graceland. You want me just to sit by and do nothing?

SAM: Once the Cage is shut, you can't go poking at it, Dean. It's too risky.

DEAN: No, no, no, no, no. As if I'm just gonna let you rot in there.

SAM: Yeah, you are. You don't have a choice.

DEAN: You can't ask me to do this.

SAM: I'm sorry, Dean. You have to.

DEAN: So then what am I supposed to do?

SAM: You go find Lisa. You pray to god she's dumb enough to take you in, and you – you have barbecues and go to football games. You go live some normal, apple-pie life, Dean. Promise me.

EXT. ALLEYWAY – NIGHT

BOBBY looks through binoculars at a building in which a man is standing in the window.

Chicago, Illinois

BOBBY walks over to SAM, DEAN and CASTIEL.

BOBBY: Demons. At least two dozen of them. You were right – something's up.

DEAN: More than something. He's here. I know it.

DEAN walks to the trunk of the IMPALA. SAM looks at BOBBY.

BOBBY: I'll see ya around, kid.

SAM: See ya around.

SAM and BOBBY hug.

BOBBY: He gets in... You fight him tooth and nail, you understand? Keep swingin'. Don't give an inch.

SAM: Yes, sir.

SAM holds out his hand to CASTIEL.

SAM: Take care of these guys, okay?

CASTIEL: That's not possible.

SAM: Then humor me.

CASTIEL: Oh. I was supposed to lie. Uh... Sure. They'll be fine.

SAM: Just – just stop... talking.

SAM walks to the trunk of the IMPALA, where the open jugs of demon blood sit.

SAM: You mind not watching this?

DEAN walks away. SAM picks up a jug.

CUT TO: SAM clears his throat and closes the trunk. DEAN is leaning on the side of the car. SAM takes a deep breath.

SAM: Okay. Let's go.

SAM walks past DEAN and after a moment DEAN follows him. BOBBY and CASTIEL watch them go.

CUT TO:

SAM raises his arms as he approaches the building with the DEMONS.

SAM: All right! We're here, you sons of bitches! Come and get it!

Two DEMONS come outside.

DEAN: Hey, guys. Is your father home?

INT. BUILDING – NIGHT

The DEMONS manhandle SAM and DEAN inside.

LUCIFER: Hey, guys. So nice of you to drop in.

ACT TWO

CHUCK (VOICEOVER): The Impala, of course, has all the things other cars have... and a few things they don't. But none of that stuff's important. This is the stuff that's important. The army man that Sam crammed in the ashtray – it's still stuck there. The Legos that Dean shoved into the vents – to this day, heat comes on and they can hear 'em rattle. These are the things that make the car theirs – really theirs. Even when Dean rebuilt her from the ground up, he made sure all these little things stayed, 'cause it's the blemishes that make her beautiful. The Devil doesn't know or care what kind of car the boys drive.

INT. BUILDING – NIGHT

LUCIFER breaths on the window pane and draws a pitchfork in the condensation.

LUCIFER: Sorry if it's a bit chilly. Most people think I burn hot. It's actually quite the opposite.

DEAN: Well, I'll alert the media.

LUCIFER's face is covered with red sores.

LUCIFER: Help me understand something, guys. I mean, stomping through my front door is... a tad suicidal, don't you think?

SAM: We're not here to fight you.

LUCIFER: No? Then why are you?

SAM: I want to say "yes."

LUCIFER: Excuse me?

SAM takes a breath, closes his eyes and the two DEMONS drop dead in flashes of light.

LUCIFER: Chock-full of Ovaltine, are we?

SAM: You heard me. Yes.

LUCIFER: You're serious.

SAM: Look, Judgment Day's a runaway train. We get it now. We just want off.

LUCIFER: Meaning?

SAM: Deal of the century. I give you a free ride, but when it's all over, I live, he lives, you bring our parents back --

LUCIFER: Okay, can we please drop the telenovela? I know you have the rings, Sam.

SAM: I have no idea what you're talking about.

LUCIFER: The Horsemen's rings? The magic keys to my Cage? Ring a bell? Come on, Sam. I've never lied to you. You could at least pay me the same respect. It's okay. I'm not mad. A wrestling match inside your noggin... I like the idea. Just you and me, one round, no tricks. You win, you jump in the hole. I win... Well, then I win. What do you say, Sam? A fiddle of gold against your soul says I'm better than you.

SAM: So he knows. Doesn't change anything.

DEAN: Sam.

SAM: We don't have any other choice.

DEAN: No.

SAM: Yes.

LUCIFER closes his eyes and bright light emanates from him.

EXT. BUILDING – NIGHT

BOBBY and CASTIEL watch as the windows of the building blaze with light, then dim.

INT. BUILDING – NIGHT

DEAN looks around. SAM is motionless on the floor. DEAN takes the Horsemen's rings out of his pocket and throws them at the wall, where they stick.

DEAN: Bvtmon...Tabges...Babalon. (OPEN THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE TO THE WICKED...)

A hole appears in the wall where the rings were. Air is sucked into it. SAM stirs and DEAN goes to him.

DEAN: Sammy!

SAM: Dean!

DEAN: Sammy!

SAM: [groans] I can feel him. Oh, god!

DEAN: You got to go now! Come on! [He helps SAM up.] Go now, Sammy. Now!

SAM walks towards the hole and takes some deep breaths. He then smiles and turns back to DEAN.

LUCIFER (in SAM's body): I was just messing with you. Sammy's long gone.

LUCIFER/SAM turns back to the hole in the wall.

LUCIFER/SAM: Chdr bvtmon tabges babalon.

The hole closes. LUCIFER/SAM removes the Horsemen's rings from the wall.

LUCIFER/SAM: I told you... this would always happen in Detroit.

LUCIFER/SAM disappears. DEAN puts his hands to his head with tears in his eyes.

EXT. DIFFERENT BUILDING – NIGHT

INT. DIFFERENT BUILDING – NIGHT

Five people stand in a loose circle. LUCIFER in SAM's body flexes his right arm, shoulder and hand.

LUCIFER/SAM: Sam. Come on. I can feel you... scratching away in there. [He looks in a mirror.] Look... I'll take the gag off, okay? You got me all wrong, kiddo. I'm not the bad guy here.

SAM: I'm gonna rip you apart from the inside out. Do you understand me?

LUCIFER/SAM: Such anger... Young Skywalker. Who are you really angry with? Me? Or that face in the mirror?

SAM: I'm sure this is all a big joke to you, huh?

LUCIFER/SAM: Not at all. I've been waiting for you... for a long, long time. Come on, Sam. You have to admit – you can feel it, right?

SAM: What?

LUCIFER/SAM: The exhilaration. And you know why that is? Because we're two halves made whole. M.F.E.O. Literally.

SAM: This feels pretty damn far from good.

LUCIFER/SAM: I'm inside your grapefruit, Sam. You can't lie to me. I see it all – how odd you always felt, how... out of place in that... family of yours. And why shouldn't you have? They were foster care – at best. I'm your real family.

SAM: No, that's not true.

LUCIFER/SAM: It is. And I know you know it. All those times you ran away, you weren't running from them. You were running towards me. This doesn't have to be a bad thing, you know. I let Dean live, didn't I? I want him to live. I'll bring your folks back, too. I want you to be happy, Sam.

SAM: I don't want anything from you.

LUCIFER/SAM: Really? Not even a little payback?

SAM: What's that supposed to mean?

LUCIFER/SAM: Look closely. None of these little devils look familiar to you?

SAM: That's Mr. Bensman... One of my grade-school teachers.

LUCIFER/SAM: And that's your friend Doug from that time in East Lansing. And Rachel... your prom date. Sam Winchester, this is your life. Azazel's gang – watching you since you were a rugrat, jerking you around like a dog on a leash. I know how you feel about them. Me too. So, what do you say you and I blow off a little steam?

EXT. STREET – DAY

The news is playing on televisions in a store window.

NEWS REPORTER: Reports are flooding in – a 7.6 earthquake in Portland, 8.1 in Boston, more in Hong Kong, Berlin, and Tehran. The U.S.G.S. has no explanation but says to expect a six-figure death toll.

DEAN and BOBBY are watching.

CASTIEL: It's starting.

DEAN: Yeah, you think, genius?

CASTIEL: You don't have to be mean.

DEAN: So what do we do now?

CASTIEL: I suggest we imbibe copious quantities of alcohol... Just wait for the inevitable blast wave.

DEAN: Yeah, swell. Thank you, Bukowski. I-I mean, how do we stop it?

CASTIEL: We don't. Lucifer will meet Michael on the chosen field, and the battle of Armageddon begins.

DEAN: Okay, well, where's this chosen field?

CASTIEL: I don't know.

DEAN: Well, there's got to be something that we can do.

CASTIEL: I'm sorry, Dean. This is over.

DEAN: You listen to me, you junkless sissy – we are not giving up! Bobby? Bobby?

BOBBY: There was never much hope to begin with. I don't know what to do.

INT. BUILDING – NIGHT

LUCIFER in SAM's body is sitting on steps. The five people are dead on the floor.

LUCIFER/SAM: [exhales sharply] So... are we having fun yet?

ACT THREE

CHUCK (VOICEOVER): In between jobs, Sam and Dean would sometimes get a day – sometimes a week, if they were lucky. They'd pass the time lining their pockets. Sam used to insist on honest work, but now he hustles pool, like his brother. They could go anywhere and do anything. They drove 1,000 miles for an Ozzy show, two days for a Jayhawks game. And when it was clear, they'd park her in the middle of nowhere, sit on the hood, and watch the stars... for hours... without saying a word. It never occurred to them that, sure, maybe they never really had a roof and four walls...

INT. CHUCK'S HOUSE – NIGHT

CHUCK is typing the words he is saying on his computer.

CHUCK: ...but they were never, in fact, homeless. That's a good line.

The phone rings and CHUCK answers it.

CHUCK: Mistress Magda?

DEAN: Um, no, Chuck.

CHUCK: Oh, uh, Dean. Uh, wow. I, uh, I didn't know that you'd call.

DEAN is in the IMPALA, parked in a city alleyway.

DEAN: Who's Mistress Magda?

CHUCK: Nothing. She's a, uh, a – just a, uh... a close friend.

DEAN: Yeah, I'll bet – real close. Whatever happened to Becky?

CHUCK: Didn't work out. I had too much respect for her.

DEAN: Boy, you really got a whole virgin/hooker thing going on, don't you?

CHUCK: Okay, this can't be why you called.

DEAN: Sam said yes.

CHUCK: I know. I saw it. I'm just working on the pages.

DEAN: Did you see where the title fight goes down?

CHUCK: The angels are keeping it top secret – very hush-hush.

DEAN: Aw, crap.

CHUCK: But I saw it anyway. Perks of being a prophet. It's tomorrow, high noon – place called Stull Cemetery.

DEAN: Stull Ceme-- Wait. I know that. That's – that's an old boneyard outside of Lawrence. Why Lawrence?

CHUCK: I don't know. It all has to end where it started, I guess.

DEAN: All right, Chuck. You know of any way to short-circuit this thing?

CHUCK: Besides the rings? No. I'm sorry.

DEAN: Well, do you have any idea what's gonna happen next?

CHUCK: I wish that I did. But I-I just – I honestly don't know yet.

DEAN: All right. Thanks, Chuck.

EXT. ALLEYWAY – NIGHT

DEAN closes the trunk of the IMPALA. BOBBY and CASTIEL walk up to him.

BOBBY: You goin' someplace? You're goin' to do somethin' stupid. You got that look.

DEAN: I'm gonna go talk to Sam.

BOBBY: You just don't give up.

DEAN: It's Sam!

CASTIEL: If you couldn't reach him here, you're certainly not gonna be able to on the battlefield.

DEAN: Well, if we've already lost, I guess I got nothing to lose, right?

CASTIEL: I just want you to understand – the only thing that you're gonna see out there is Michael killing your brother.

DEAN: Well, then I ain't gonna let him die alone.

DEAN gets into the IMPALA and starts the engine.

EXT. STULL CEMETERY – DAY

LUCIFER in SAM's body stands in the cemetery. There is the sound of wings and MICHAEL in ADAM's body appears.

LUCIFER/SAM: It's good to see you, Michael.

MICHAEL/ADAM: You too. It's been too long. Can you believe it's finally here?

LUCIFER/SAM: No. Not really.

MICHAEL/ADAM: Are you ready?

LUCIFER/SAM: As I'll ever be. A part of me wishes we didn't have to do this.

MICHAEL/ADAM: Yeah. Me too.

LUCIFER/SAM: Then why are we?

MICHAEL/ADAM: Oh, you know why! I have no choice, after what you did.

LUCIFER/SAM: What I did? What if it's not my fault?

MICHAEL/ADAM: What is that supposed to mean?

LUCIFER/SAM: Think about it. Dad made everything. Which means he made me who I am! God wanted the Devil.

MICHAEL/ADAM: So?

LUCIFER/SAM: So why? And why make us fight? I just can't figure out the point.

MICHAEL/ADAM: What's your point?

LUCIFER/SAM: We're going to kill each other. And for what? One of Dad's tests. And we don't even know the answer. We're brothers. Let's just walk off the chessboard.

MICHAEL/ADAM: I'm sorry. I-I can't do that. I'm a good son, and I have my orders.

LUCIFER/SAM: But you don't have to follow them.

MICHAEL/ADAM: What, you think I'm gonna rebel? Now? I'm not like you.

LUCIFER/SAM: Please, Michael --

MICHAEL/ADAM: You know, you haven't changed a bit, little brother. Always blaming everybody but yourself. We were together. We were happy. But you betrayed me – all of us – and you made our father leave.

LUCIFER/SAM: No one makes Dad do anything. He is doing this to us.

MICHAEL/ADAM: You're a monster, Lucifer. And I have to kill you.

LUCIFER/SAM: If that's the way it's got to be... Then I'd like to see you try.

LUCIFER/SAM and MICHAEL/ADAM slowly circle one another. We hear the sound of a car engine.

INT. IMPALA – DAY

DEAN puts a tape into the tape deck and turns up the volume. "Rock of Ages" by Def Leppard plays.

MUSIC: * Gunter, glieben, glauchen, globen! All right! I got something to say! Hey it's better to burn out! Yeah! Than fade awa-a-a-y all right oh! Gonna start a fire! *

EXT. STULL CEMETERY – DAY

DEAN drives up to LUCIFER/SAM and MICHAEL/ADAM.

DEAN: Howdy, boys.

MUSIC: * We're gonna burn this damn place down! Ooh, ooh! Down to the ground. *

DEAN: Sorry. Am I interrupting something?

ACT FOUR

EXT. STULL CEMETERY – DAY

DEAN: Hey. We need to talk.

LUCIFER/SAM: Dean. Even for you, this is a whole new mountain of stupid.

DEAN: I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to Sam.

MICHAEL/ADAM: You're no longer the vessel, Dean. You got no right to be here.

DEAN: Adam, if you're in there somewhere, I am so sorry.

MICHAEL/ADAM: Adam isn't home right now.

DEAN: Well, then you're next on my list, buttercup. But right now, I need five minutes with him.

MICHAEL/ADAM: You little maggot. You are no longer a part of this story!

CASTIEL: Hey, ass-butt!

CASTIEL and BOBBY have appeared. CASTIEL is holding a bottle from which a flame is burning – a Molotov cocktail. CASTIEL throws the bottle at MICHAEL/ADAM, who screams as he goes up in flames.

DEAN: "Ass-butt"?

CASTIEL: He'll be back – and upset – but you got your five minutes.

LUCIFER/SAM: Castiel. Did you just Molotov my brother with holy fire?

CASTIEL: Uh... no.

LUCIFER/SAM: No one dicks with Michael but me.

LUCIFER/SAM snaps his fingers. CASTIEL explodes in a rain of blood and chunks of meat.

DEAN: Sammy, can you hear me?

LUCIFER/SAM: You know... I tried to be nice... for Sammy's sake. But you... are such a pain... in my ass.

LUCIFER/SAM throws DEAN onto the windshield of the IMPALA, which shatters. BOBBY shoots LUCIFER/SAM in the back. When LUCIFER/SAM turns, BOBBY shoots him again in the front. LUCIFER/SAM makes a twisting hand motion and BOBBY's neck snaps.

DEAN: N-o-o-o-o!

LUCIFER/SAM: Yes.

LUCIFER/SAM grabs DEAN's legs and pulls him off the hood of the IMPALA. He punches DEAN hard. DEAN falls back against the IMPALA, spitting blood.

DEAN: Sammy? Are you in there?

LUCIFER/SAM: Oh, he's in here, all right. [He punches DEAN again.] And he's gonna feel the snap of your bones. [Another punch. DEAN falls to the ground.] Every single one. [He hauls DEAN to his feet.] We're gonna take our time.

LUCIFER/SAM punches DEAN a further ten times. DEAN, his face now very swollen and bleeding, puts out a hand to LUCIFER/SAM's jacket.

DEAN: Sam, it's okay. It's okay. I'm here. I'm here. I'm not gonna leave you. [LUCIFER/SAM punches him twice more.] I'm not gonna leave you.

LUCIFER/SAM draws back his fist for another punch.

LUCIFER/SAM stares. His fist unclenches: it's SAM again. He lets go of DEAN, who falls to the ground against the IMPALA.

SAM: It's okay, Dean. It's gonna be okay. I've got him.

SAM takes out the Horsemen's rings and tosses them on the ground.

SAM: Bvtmon tabges babalon.

The ground caves in around the rings and air is sucked into the hole. SAM and DEAN look at each other as the hole widens. SAM breathes deeply.

MICHAEL/ADAM: Sam! It's not gonna end this way! Step back!

SAM: You're gonna have to make me!

MICHAEL/ADAM: I have to fight my brother, Sam! Here and now! It's my destiny!

SAM looks at DEAN, closes his eyes and spreads his arms. MICHAEL/ADAM lunges forward and grabs SAM's jacket. SAM grabs MICHAEL/ADAM's arm and they fall together into the hole. After few moments the hole closes in a blinding flash of light. The Horsemen's rings burn bright in the grass on the ground where the hole was. DEAN closes his eyes as he leans back against the IMPALA.

ACT FIVE

EXT. STULL CEMETERY – DAY

DEAN kneels on the ground near the IMPALA. CASTIEL appears next to him.

DEAN: Cas, you're alive?

CASTIEL: I'm better than that.

CASTIEL touches Dean on the forehead and Dean's wounds heal. DEAN stands up.

DEAN: Cas, are you God?

CASTIEL: That's a nice compliment. But no. Although, I do believe he brought me back. New and improved.

CASTIEL walks to BOBBY and touches him on the forehead, resurrecting him. DEAN looks down at the Horsemen's rings, which he holds in his hand.

CHUCK (voiceover): Endings are hard.

INT. CHUCK'S HOUSE – DAY

A manuscript for "Supernatural: Swan Song by Carver Edlund" lies on CHUCK's desk.

CHUCK (VOICEOVER): Any chapped-ass monkey with a keyboard can poop out a beginning, but endings are impossible. You try to tie up every loose end, but you never can. The fans are always gonna bitch. There's always gonna be holes. And since it's the ending, it's all supposed to add up to something. I'm telling you, they're a raging pain in the ass.

CHUCK types on his computer.

EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

The IMPALA drives down the road.

INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN and CASTIEL are in the IMPALA, DEAN driving.

DEAN: What are you gonna do now?

CASTIEL: Return to Heaven, I suppose.

DEAN: Heaven?

CASTIEL: With Michael in the Cage, I'm sure it's total anarchy up there.

DEAN: So, what, you're the new sheriff in town?

CASTIEL: I like that. Yeah. I suppose I am.

DEAN: Wow. God gives you a brand-new, shiny set of wings, and suddenly you're his bitch again.

CASTIEL: I don't know what God wants. I don't know if he'll even return. It just... seems like the right thing to do.

DEAN: Well, if you do see him, you tell him I'm coming for him next.

CASTIEL: You're angry.

DEAN: That's an understatement.

CASTIEL: He helped. Maybe even more than we realize.

DEAN: That's easy for you to say. He brought you back. But what about Sam? What about me, huh? Where's my grand prize? All I got is my brother in a hole!

CASTIEL: You got what you asked for, Dean. No paradise. No hell. Just more of the same. I mean it, Dean. What would you rather have? Peace or freedom?

When DEAN looks over, CASTIEL is gone.

DEAN: Well, you really suck at goodbyes, you know that?

EXT. BOBBY'S SALVAGE YARD – DAY

DEAN and BOBBY stand near the IMPALA.

CHUCK (VOICEOVER): This is the last Dean and Bobby will see of each other for a very long time. [DEAN and BOBBY hug before DEAN drives away.] And, for the record, at this point next week, Bobby will be hunting a rugaru outside of Dayton. But not Dean. Dean didn't want Cas to save him. Every part of him, every fiber he's got, wants to die, or find a way to bring Sam back. But he isn't gonna do either. Because he made a promise.

EXT. LISA'S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN knocks and LISA opens the door.

DEAN: [voice breaking] Hey, Lisa.

LISA: Oh, thank god. Are you all right?

DEAN: [voice breaking] Yeah. Uh, if it's not too late, I... think I'd like to take you up on that beer.

LISA: It's never too late.

DEAN steps inside and into LISA's arms.

LISA: Shh. It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

CHUCK (VOICEOVER): So, what's it all add up to? It's hard to say. But me, I'd say this was a test... for Sam and Dean. And I think they did all right. [Flashbacks play.] Up against good, evil, angels, devils, destiny, and God himself, they made their own choice. They chose family. And, well... isn't that kinda the whole point?

CHUCK: No doubt – endings are hard. But then again... nothing ever really ends, does it?

CHUCK smiles and vanishes into thin air.

INT. LISA'S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN sits at LISA'S table with BEN. LISA brings a dish to the table.

LISA: You okay?

DEAN: Yeah, I'm good.

DEAN takes a drink of whisky.

EXT. LISA'S HOUSE – NIGHT

A streetlight burns out. We see someone standing beneath it, watching. It is SAM.
