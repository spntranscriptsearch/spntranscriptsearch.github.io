NOW

Outside Gunnison, Colorado. The year was 1989.

EXTERIOR: Wide shot of woods with small creek and half-dried bushes.

Two boys are trekking down the path while having a conversation, an older brother looks no more than sixteen, whereas his little brother is around twelve. They each carries a cooler box and fishing rod.

Jesse: It finally happened.

Matt: What? You didn’t get detention this week?

Jesse: Me and Jackie, we kissed.

Matt: Okay, can I stop hearing about him every two minutes now? “You think he likes me?”, “Jackie looked at me. I-I think he looked at me.”

Jesse: He definitely likes me.

Matt: Jesse, you know you gotta be careful, right?

Jesse: I’m not an idiot.

The boys are crossing a wooden bridge to get past the creek.

Matt: Yeah, I know, but it’s not just Ned and Charlie and those dicks who’ll stomp your head in. I mean, everybody at school and in town … they won’t leave you alone.

Jesse: Okay. I wish we were gone already. Can’t you lie and say you’re 18 and get a fake ID?

Matt: California’s expensive, okay? We just gotta save some more money.

Jesse: You can sell your collection.

Matt: I will, okay? When it’s time. I can get at least $900 for the Buffalo nickel and another $400 for the double eagle.

Jesse: That’s a lot.

Mattther: Look, Jess.

Matt stops Jesse’s steps and starts talking seriously.

Matt: As soon as I turn 18, I promise, we’re gonna get out of here, okay?

Jesse looks concerned at first about Matt’s plan, but then he comes around.

Jesse: Can I see it?

Matt: Yeah.

Matt bends down to put the cooler box and hands the fishing rod in his hand Jesse, then he takes a small wallet from his pocket and shows what’s inside to Jesse, a small nickel. Jesse looks at it adoringly.

Matt: Come on. Here.

Matt stretches his hand to get the nickel back and receives it from his brother, then he puts it back into the wallet.

Matt: Gotta go get that early morning bit, right?

Jesse: Hang on. I gotta pee.

Jesse put the fishing needs in his hand to the ground, and walks away to a tree and starts unzipping his pants. Just before he do so, there was a mysterious sound coming from the bushes that gets his attention.

Jesse: [aware] Matty? Matty?

EXTERIOR: The bushes where Matt and Jesse are talking before.

Matt: [in the distance] Jesse! Aah!

Jesse: [screaming] Matty! Matty!

Jesse runs to the spot where he and Matt were. Matt disappears. The cooler boxes and fishing rods are on the ground, abandoned.

Matt: [in the distance] Jesse! Aah!

Jesse sees Matt being dragged by something. Matt is trying to let go. Matt: Jesse! Aah! Jesse! Jesse! Aah!

A mysterious creature is taking Matt away. Jesse starts to panic.

Jesse: Matty! [chases the creature] Matty! Matty! Matty!

Jesse stops in an open space. Mysterious sounds comes from behind him. He slowly turns around in fear.

TITLE SEQUENCE

EXTERIOR: The Men of Letters’ bunker walls and surrounding woods. The Impala parks just outside the entrance.

INTERIOR: The bunker’s War Room. Dean is sitting on one of the chairs, reading a book. Sam comes in carrying a bowl of cereal.

Sam: Dude, you even move since last night?

Dean: [tiredly] Sleeping is the new smoking.

Sam: What? No, it’s not. It’s sitting. Sitting is the new smoking.

Dean: That’s can’t be right.

Sam: Dean, we’ll find Cas, okay? He’s stronger that he looks.

Dean: You know, we gambled with Cas, and now Amara has him.

Sam: For a reason, which means he’s still alive.

Dean: [shakes his head] I’ve been with Amara. Her beef is with the big guys … with God, with Lucifer. The small fries, even an angel like Cas, doesn’t even register. And if it meant hurting Lucifer, killing Cas would mean nothing to her.

Sam: It’s been a week. We’ve still got no leads.

Dean: You think I don’t know that? [rises from the chair]

Sam: So … so we get back out there. We get back to work. We keep moving. We keep working. We’ll catch a break on Cas. We have to. It’s … it’s karma.

Dean: [looks to another book] You know, karma’s been kicking us in the teeth lately.

Sam: Yeah. [puts bowl down and lifts laptop] So … let’s kick it back. Here, check this out [opens laptop].

Dean closes the book in his hands and walks closer to Sam.

Sam: Libby Strauss. Uh, went missing near Gunnison, Colorado. Now Libby’s friend claimed she was carried off by a mutant creature with green eyes.

Dean: [sits back on the chair] Demon?

Sam: That’s what I thought, but it gets better. The friend chased after ‘em and she found Libby, only it wasn’t Libby anymore because now she, too, is a green-eyed mutant.

Dean: Demon swap suits?

Sam: Only one way to find out.

EXTERIOR: The Impala drives on the road.

EXTERIOR: A police station on the countryside with mountain view on the background.

INTERIOR: Sheriff’s office, Sam and Dean sat with the female coloured-skin sheriff.

Sam: How many missing do you have?

Sheriff Tyson: Six, all in the last forty-eight hours. They’re disappearing one by one.

Sam: Okay, uh, let’s start with Libby Strauss. I understand that she was from out of town?

Sheriff Tyson: Uh, she and a friend were visiting from Tuscon. Libby was the first reported missing.

Dean: But all the rest have been local?

Sheriff Tyson: All residents.

Sam: you got any leads?

Sheriff Tyson: [inhaling] The only eyewitness I have is the friend. Not the most reliable source.

Dean: Why is that?

Sheriff Tyson: She and Libby were on the last legs of their cannabis tasting tour. Fumes still coming off the girl when I questioned her.

Dean: A trippin’ trip.

Sam: Have you had anything odd like this happen around here before?

Sheriff Tyson: [gets up from her chair and moves closer to Sam and Dean, leans on her desk] Twenty-seven years ago. About a dozen residents went missing. Twenty-seven years before that, another eight disappeared.

Dean: All within the same time frame? Couple days?

Sheriff Tyson: Same time of year, too.

Sam: And how far back do the disappearances go?

Sheriff Tyson: [shrugs] That’s it. The town’s only been here since the fifties. It was all virgin forest till they found coal here.

Dean: So then how do people explain the missing?

Sheriff Tyson: [sadly] Mostly they don’t. People come and go in this town. I’ve only been here two years, myself. There are some old-timers with their theories.

Sam: Such as?

Sheriff Tyson: Town’s built on an Indian burial ground. Forest folk are pissed because we stole their coal.

Sam: And what’s your take?

Sheriff Tyson: We’re a small town. People get bored, they get fed up, they leave. Once a few get free, it’s like a jail break. Encourages the others.

Dean: Every twenty-seven years like clockwork?

Sheriff Tyson: Honestly, I-I’m just focused on the missing that I have right now. You’re welcome to take a look at the files, talk to the witness. I’ve got panicked residents I need to talk down.

Sam: Right. Sure.

Sheriff Tyson: walks out of her office, leaving Sam and Dean.

Dean: What the hell is going on here?

Sam: No idea. Whatever it is, it’s moved in. Or keeps coming back for seconds. All right, I’ll go check on the reports on the other missing.

Dean: Oh. I guess that leaves me Ganja Girl.

INTERIOR: Outside interrogation room, a cabinet with folder filing ,table lamp, and coffee machine was on top of the cabinet. An officer is seen taking a drink from the water dispenser. Dean is inside the interrogation room with Ganja Girl, or Cori.

Cori: You’re gonna say I was hallucinating. The weed was laced with PCP or something.

Dean: It’s okay, Cory, just … just …. Tell me what you remember. And nothing is too strange or weird to mention.

Cori: [hesitates] The thing that took Libby was naked and pale. Except for the eyes. I swear to God, they flashed green for a second.

Dean tilts his head slightly at the explanation.

Cori: And it didn’t have any hair. Anywhere.

Dean stares at Cori in wonder.

Cori: It was shaped like a man. Or was it a woman?

Dean: [curiously] Was it a man or a woman?

Cori: It didn’t have a … [points downward with her fingers]

Dean: A penis?

Cori: [wide-eyed] It didn’t have anything.

Dean: What you’re saying it was junkless?

Cori: Completely.

Dean: Okay, uh … anything else unusual you can remember? Sounds? Smells?

Cori: Definitely sound. When I found Libby, when was just standing there … shivering, shaking.

FLASHBACK: We see Libby standing in the dark, looking down and her hands are shaking, unusual sound is coming out from her. Cori was approaching her.

Cori: Libby?

Libby doesn’t answer, she only moves her head to Cori’s direction, still with the peculiar sound.

Cori: What happened?

Libby looks to Cori darkly, then her eyes turns bright green and she hisses. Cori screams and runs away.

INTERIOR: Interrogation room.

Cori: It wasn’t Libby. [paused] I don’t know what it was.

Dean: The buzzing … was coming from her body?

Cori: [nods] We heard the same sound right before that thing jumped out at us.

INTERIOR: File room in the police station, Sam is browsing through old files with his laptop open and Dean sits on the desk in front of his brother.

Dean: Green eyes, buzzing. Weed alone doesn’t conjure up that kind of scenario. [turns to Sam] Isn’t that right, Sam?

Sam: [turns to Dean with a caught expression] Dude, I was eighteen.

Dean: Sinner. [smirked]

Sam: It was college. It was probably oregano anyways.

Dean: Rebel. [smiled]

Sam: You’re an idiot. Look, I’m coming up empty also. Uh, nothing on Junkless or the green-eyed shaker.

Dean: [turns to Sam] So we think Junkless turned Libby?

Sam: Hold up. We’re not actually gonna go with “Junkless” on this, are we?

Dean: Eh. [shrugs head]

Sam: Dude, that’s a new low, even for us.

Dean: Well, something happened. You got the eyes, the buzzing.

Sam: Yeah, I know you’re right. That’s can’t be a coincidence. Uh, here, I found this, [picks a file from the pile of paper], the, uh, the sheriff who was here in ’89, Cochran [hands the papers to Dean]. Those are his notes. There’s no mention of buzzing. But he seemed to be closing in on some of the missing, and then his notes, they just kind of abruptly stop.

Dean: [reading the papers] He take a flyer, too?

Sam: No. he remained sheriff for a few more months. He ended up resigning and, uh, then he fell off the radar. I asked around the station, but that was a few sheriffs ago, so … [shakes head].

Dean: Nothing?

Sam: The dispatcher said she thought he moved to Florida, but that was a dead end.

Dean: Kind of like this case.

Sam: Yeah [flips another file papers]. Wait a second. Most of the witnesses in ’89 and ’62, they’re all dead or they’re moved away, but there’s does seem to be one holdout from the ’89 case, Etta Fraser [turns to Dean].

Dean: Let’s go talk to Etta.

INTERIOR: Living room of a suburban house.

Sam: Your husband was one of the people who disappeared in 1989.

Etta: Oh, my second husband. Barely that. Pete only stuck around a couple months.

Dean: So he left voluntarily?

Etta: Oh [chuckles], Pete was volunteering himself all over the place [nods]. Right before he disappeared, people saw Pete diddling two different women in public, separate occasions.

Dean: You mean they actually saw him in the act?

Etta: [deadpans] What does “diddling” mean to you? Uh, Pete was never a showman, but apparently, Doris Kagen and Missy Petersen brought out the hog in him.

Sam: Doris and Melissa, uh, Missy, they disappeared that year, too.

Etta: [scoffs] Oh, yeah. Surprise, surprise. I’d bet my mortgage Pete ran off with one of them.

Sam: But you reported them as missing.

Etta: Well, he didn’t come home for three days. I thought he was dead in a ditch somewhere. We didn’t find out about the women for a long time after.

Sam: Is that … is that white sage?

Etta: [nods] Mm. yeah, you know your herbs [smiles flirtatiously].

Dean and Sam look at each other awkwardly.

Dean: You, uh, planning on taking a trip? [nods to the suitcases on the hall]

Etta: Uh, yeah, I’m going to stay with my sister a few weeks.

Dean: For any reason?

Etta: [turns her head from the suitcases] You’re gonna think it’s real out there.

Sam: Well, you’re be surprised at the kind of crazy we hear [smiles].

Etta: Well [licks her lips], when Pete went missing and we found out about the women, my grandma said that he “got the chitters”. According to her, once a generation around the spring equinox, people in town start going nuts, have orgies, copulating in the woods. And then they disappear, never to be heard from again.

Dean: Well, that’s certainly one explanation for Pete.

Etta looks at Dean questioningly. Dean looks away.

Etta: I never really, um, believed what she said, but … now people are disappearing again [nods]. She always said burn sage to protect yourself [shrugs].

Sam: Hmm. So why did she call it “the chitters”?

Etta: Oh, that was the word Gran used to describe the sound coming from the woods when the orgies were happening. Yeah, kind of a buzzing, rattling.

Dean: Did your Gran ever mention something about, uh, green eyes?

Etta: Oh, yeah [nods]. Gran said that if you got the chitters, you get so revved up with lust that your eyes would shine like emeralds [looks affectionately to Sam].

Dean turns his head to Sam, who rises his eyebrows in confusion. Sam then realizes what Etta’s look means. Dean looks again towards Etta, she’s licking her lips. Dean shrugs before looking sideways to Sam.

Sam: [smiles nervously] Uh …

EXTERIOR: Outside Etta’s house.

Sam: So, we got spring equinox. Which was yesterday.

Dean: Orgies, buzzing green-eyed freaks. Sounds like a rager.

Sam: All right, let’s pick up a six-pack.

Dean: Just six?

Sam: Oh, whatever. Let’s hit the books.

Sam and Dean goes into the Impala.

EXTERIOR: A path under the bridge, the walls are filled with graffiti. A couple of man and woman was walking through the path, talking.

Girl: Just don’t be a wuss. It’s faster this way.

Cliff: And it smells like a urinal, but whatevs.

They suddenly stops and goes wide-eyed. In front of them there’s an old sofa and on top of it there’s another couple making out vigorously.

Cliff: Whoa.

Suddenly one of the couple behind the sofa, the man, shows and looks at the couple. Cliff, who was walking, looks surprised. The man on top of the sofa, hisses and his eyes glows green. As well as the woman who’s under him.

Woman: [screams]

Cliff: Come on!

Cliff and his girlfriend turn around to escape, but their way is blocked by another man with shining green eyes, who jumps to the man. The woman screams and runs away, while Cliff is being bitten by the green-eyed man.

EXTERIOR: The police station with siren blaring in the distance. The Impala is parked outside.

INTERIOR: The interrogation room. Sam and Dean are asking the girl from previous incident under the bridge.

Woman: We ran, and then another one with green eyes came from nowhere. It was Coach Hollister.

Sheriff Tyson: Grant Hollister?

Woman: He attacked us. He had these teeth that were pointed. He ripped into Cliff. I could hear him screaming, but … I ran.

Sam nods listening to her story.

Woman: He killed Cliff.

Sam: Did you, by any chance, recognize the couple?

Woman: [nods] It was one of the Deaver brothers, the tall one, and Mrs. Limoski.

Sheriff Tyson: You’re sure about this?

The girl answers with a nod.

Dean: Did you see anybody else?

Woman: I couldn’t see their faces, but I’m pretty sure there was more of them down the alley, past the couple. I-I could see them moving around.

Dean: The, uh, the couple that-that was going at it, would you say this was a … orgy-like situation?

Woman: I’ve never seen an orgy.

Dean: No?

Sheriff Tyson: Enough.

Dean stopped abruptly. Sheriff Tyson rises from her seat and walks out from the room.

Sam: Excuse us a second.

Sam and Dean follow the Sheriff out from the room.

Sheriff Tyson: [turns to face the brothers] I got a dead kid minus a chunk out of his neck and all the people that girl ID’ed missing.

Dean: Were missing. Yeah, not they’re all having sex with each other.

Sheriff Tyson: Then there’s that.

Sam and Dean looks uncomfortable.

Sheriff Tyson: Putting aside the fact that Rob the fireman is screwing the librarian, and I am friends with his pregnant wife, now I’ve got two witnesses claiming they saw … what? I don’t even know. Aliens? Attacking people. Yeah. What is this? Spanish Fly gone bad?

Dean: Well, I can honestly say this is a new one for us.

Sheriff Tyson: I gotta go contact the families.

Sam: Right.

Sheriff Tyson walks from Sam and Dean to do her duty.

Dean: So we have confirmed orgy-ish behaviour.

Sam: Yeah, just like Etta’s husband.

Dean: What, the chitters? [walks]

Sam: [follows his brother] Well, we should go check the crime scene.

Dean: [answers phone] Agent Lewis. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey [stops and listens to the person on line]. Cori, calm down! Where exactly? [listens to Cori on the phone] All right, I’m on my way [lines off phone].

Sam looks concerned.

Dean: Ganja Girl’s pretty hysterical, says she just saw her friend walking in the woods. She’s too freaked out to go, so …

Sam: You go. I’ll grab the alley.

Dean: Great.

Sam and Dean walks to start investigating.

EXTERIOR: The woods near the suburb area. The Impala is seen coming and stops inside the woods. Dean steps out and starts checking the surroundings. There’s a rattling sound coming near him, and he turns. There’s a girl standing with her head down.

Dean: Libby?

The rattling sound stops. Dean walks approaching her.

Dean: Hey, Libby, there’s a whole lot of people looking for you.

Libby lifts up his face and looks to Dean. Her face was pale and dirty, then she snarls at Dean and her eyes shines green. Dean stops his steps and suddenly he’s being pushed by a man to the ground. Dean fights the man, who’s snarling and rattling. Dean punches the man, and when the male chitter about to return, he suddenly gets decapitated.

Dean: Uhh!

The head rolls on the ground.

Dean is panting from the fight, and when he looks up there’s a man holding a machete and offering his hand to Dean to get up. When Dean finally gets back to his feet, there was another man running to their direction and starts stabbing the chitter in the chest several times.

Cesar: You hurt?

Dean: No, I’m-I’m-I’m good. Thanks.

Cesar: Jesse, I think it’s dead.

Jesse: Just making sure.

Dean still has his eyes to the younger hunter, Jesse, and the body on the ground that now has blood stains on the chest. Jesse takes a step back to stand next to Cesar.

Dean: [confused] Who the hell are you guys?

Jesse: You wouldn’t believe us.

Dean is getting more confused with Jesse’s answer.

EXTERIOR: The view of the woods and mountain behind it. The Impala and another car are parked outside a countryside-styled restaurant.

INTERIOR: The restaurant with billiard balls colliding on the background. A waitress brings two bottles of beer to Dean and the other men’s table.

Dean: So, how long you guys been hunting? [looks to Cesar and Jesse in turns]

Jesse: Together? About seven years. And we’ve heard of the Winchesters, but we also heard you bit it a couple years ago.

Dean: Ah, that’s a long, ugly, ugly story [shakes head and turns to the entrance door when Sam walks in].

Sam: Hey [waves].

Dean: Sam, hey. Uh, Jesse and Cesar [waves hand to Jesse, then Cesar].

Sam: [shakes hand with the other hunters] You guys are hunters, right?

Dean calls the waitress for more beers.

Cesar: Yeah.

Sam: I’m surprised we never ran into you [sits next to Dean].

Cesar: Well, we’re mostly in Mexico. Sometimes we make a run over into Texas.

Sam: Nice. Uh, nothing in the alley, by the way [taps Dean’s shoulder]. Thanks [looks to the waitress who brings him beer, smiles to Dean, and takes a second look to the waitress].

Dean: You guys have any idea what we’re hunting?

Jesse: They’re called Bisaan. It’s a kind of cicada spirit.

Sam: We couldn’t find any lore on ‘em.

Jesse: They’re rare, at least in America. People think that they originated in Malaysia, in the forests there.

Dean: So what are they doing here?

Jesse: What they always do. Every 27 years, they come up from the underground, they mate like crazy for a few days. That generation dies off, and the whole cycle goes on repeat.

Sam: So they’re reproducing?

Dean: But we’re-we’re dealing with townsfolk here. I mean, they didn’t just crawl out of a hole a few days ago.

Jesse: This is what surfaces [gets his tablet]. Bisaan can’t reproduce on their own [shows a picture of wayang on the screen], so they take over a human body to do the deed. They enter through the mouth, like a hermit crab climbing into a shell.

Cesar: Only they don’t care that the shell’s not empty.

Dean: Well, that explains Junkless.

Sam: What about the buzzing?

Jesse: It’s how they communicate. It’s a mating call.

Dean: And you, um, kill them by taking off their heads, I see.

Jesse: Seems to do the trick.

Sam: How do you guys knows so much about these things?

Cesar turns to Jesse.

Jesse: One of them took my brother 27 years ago.

Sam and Dean look surprised. Sam turns to Dean, and Dean is speechless.

Sam: [looks to Jesse] I’m sorry to hear that.

Jesse: I’ve been waiting years to come back and have this shot at them. So, I hope you understand, I’m gonna ask you two to take a step back from this one.

Dean: [nods] Well, catch us up. Where have you guys been?

Jesse: In the woods, where the action is, looking for their burrow and saving your ass.

Sam is slightly taken aback, but he gives a look of approval. Cesar scoffs.

Jesse: What?

Cesar: Well, one of the reasons we’ve been holed up in the trees is because Jesse hates the town and everyone in it.

Jesse: Because they’re ignorant and useless. [turns to Cesar] They didn’t believe me 27 years ago, they’re not gonna start now.

Cesar: [sternly] It’s boneheaded not to be following leads in town.

Jesse: Hey, nobody stopping you from talking to the whole box of crackers.

Cesar sighs and looks away.

Dean: Ah, you guys fight just like brothers [chuckles], almost as bad as us.

Cesar: Well, [paused], it’s more like an old married couple.

Dean: [laughed] That’s … [looks to Cesar]

Cesar signs Dean with his look. Dean turns to Jesse.

Dean: [with realisation] Oh, so … [points back and forth to Jesse and Cesar]

Cesar: Yeah.

Dean: Okay, that’s …

Cesar puts his beer bottle on the table and looks at Dean, while Jesse is being silent.

Dean: What’s it like, settling down with a hunter?

Cesar: Smelly, dirty. [turns to Jesse] Twice the worrying about getting ganked.

Sam smiles understandingly, and looks away.

Dean: [nods] Huh.

Sam: Jesse, you’re from here. Do you know anything about the sheriff, Cochran, who worked the case back in ’89?

Jesse: That son of a bitch was incompetent. He shut himself away years ago.

Sam: Do you know where he is?

Jesse: Turned tail, ran off into the hills, couple towns over. [angrily] Lives like a hermit.

Sam: Can you take us there? Uh, it seems like he was honing in on some of the missing.

Jesse: [sternly] We need to find the burrow.

Cesar: [patiently] Jess, we’ve been beating around the woods for two days.

Jesse: [stubbornly] That’s where they are. You saw the tracks.

Cesar: I can keep searching on my own. We’re losing.

Dean: Why don’t I go with you? [looks to Cesar] We’ll start where-where I got jumped.

Cesar nods at Dean’s idea, then he and Dean turn to Jesse.

Jesse looks concerned, but he gives an approval.

INTERIOR: The Impala was going down the road. It’s raining.

Dean: How long do we have before these things are gone?

Cesar: [sitting on the passenger seat] We gotta find the burrow tonight. By tomorow, the Bisaan will be underground, dying. Won’t be able to find them or their eggs. [angrily] And Jesse will wait another 27 years.

Dean turns to Cesar next to him, and looks sharp to the road.

Dean: Well there’s four of us now.

Cesar turns to Dean and looks to the road again.

Dean: We’ll smoke those sons of bitches.

Cesar: Yeah, it’ll eat him alive if we don’t.

Dean: It’s hard to watch someone go through that, isn’t it?

Cesar: [huffs] Yeah, [pauses], I never had a brother or a sister, but I’ve seen it over and over, when someone loses someone when they’re young. It never heals over.

Dean: No, it doesn’t.

Cesar: And the insane thing is, how many hunters have you seen over the years get their revenge?

Dean: A few.

Cesar: Yeah. Me too. [pauses] And they are never fixed, are they?

Dean: No, I guess not. [pauses] But, you gotta help him get that revenge anyway [turns to Cesar].

Both hunters look at each other meaningfully, then to the road. The Impala rolling down in the rain.

EXTERIOR: The woods where Dean met Cesar and Jesse before. Dean and Cesar investigate the surroundings using torches. They found footsteps to the deeper side of the woods. Cesar signals to Dean to check it out, while he’s looking for another signs of Bisaan around the woods.

EXTERIOR: Jesse and Cesar’s SUV vehicle.

INTERIOR: Jesse driving the car, and Sam sat on the passenger seat.

Jesse: [sighs] I must’ve stumbled around searching for Matty, ten, twenty minutes. I was shaking and panicking. Told myself I had to focus, find him, and I did. Those green eyes staring at me. It wasn’t human. [looks to Sam] I took off, didn’t look back.

Sam: You never saw him again after that?

Jesse: [shakes head] Everybody in town, including my Mom, thought some pervert had taken him. She was falling apart, crying. Why didn’t I remember what the guy looked like? Why was I making up this lie?

Sam: She still live here?

Jesse: Moved as soon as she could. Still thinks I should’ve done something. Saved him. Everybody did.

Sam: They couldn’t accept that your brother was taken by a monster, huh? [smiles understandingly]

Jesse: They couldn’t accept a lot of things. But Matty did. [pauses] He was a great brother.

Sam frowns at the last remark from Jesse.

EXTERIOR: The woods where Dean and Cesar are looking for the Bisaan’s burrow.

Cesar is searching on his side of area, when there’s a figure coming out from the ground behind him. He doesn’t hear the sound of dry leaves flipping when the creature moves, it’s the sound of a twig cracking that finally makes him turn around. When Cesar aims his torch to the ground, he sees that there’s a disturbance on the soil, and suddenly something jumps on him. His scream makes Dean comes quickly to help.

Dean: You good?

Cesar: Go!

Dean runs to chase the creature.

EXTERIOR: An old wooden house on the hill. Jesse’s SUV is parked outside the house, along with the house owner’s car.

INTERIOR: Living room of the house, table is full of beer bottles. Sam and Jesse are sitting in front of the former sheriff, Cochran.

Cochran: I don’t care if you’re FBI or not. It was thirty years ago, I don’t remember a damn thing. Except we never found him.

Jesse: Well, one of them is a sixteen-year old boy, and that was my brother.

Cochran: A lot of folks lost family that year.

Jesse: And you didn’t help a damn one of them, did you?

Sam: [turns to Jesse] Jesse …

Jesse looks sideways to Sam, then to Cochran. The air is awkward between them.

Sam: Mr. Cochran, we’re here because more people have gone missing. The same M.O.

Cochran looks surprised at Sam’s information.

Cochran: No. No, it’s done. It’s done.

Sam and Jesse looks at each other in wonder.

EXTERIOR: The woods where Cesar and Dean are.

Cesar is checking his leg, when Dean comes.

Dean: Cesar?

Cesar: You lost it?

Dean: [pants] No. no, I followed it. I saw where it went. I think I found the burrow.

Cesar: [sighs] Thank God.

Dean: I think that’s why he attacked you. He was being protective.

Cesar: Of what?

Dean: The females, the burrow.

Cesar: Oh, that makes sense. Must be laying their eggs by now.

Dean: You gonna be all right?

Cesar: Yeah. Where are we headed?

Dean: It’s a hike.

Cesar: That’s okay.

Dean: I tried to call Sam, there’s no service.

Cesar: Do you think the whole brood’s there?

Dean: [nods] If we’re lucky.

Cesar: Let’s go.

Dean: All right.

INTERIOR: Wash basin inside a kitchen.

Someone is turning on the tap and washes his face there. It’s Cochran. He wipes his face with water, and dries it with a towel. He then walks to the living room, where Sam and Jesse are waiting.

Cochran: Okay, I’ll tell you what. Leave your card, and if anything comes back to me, I’ll call.

Sam: Mr. Cochran, you don’t own a phone. Look, we’re not asking for a lot. Just please tell us what you know.

Cochran: I couldn’t find them. So that’s on me.

Sam rises his eyebrows in confusion, and Jesse looks up.

Cochran: [sighs] I never recovered from it. I-I … [scratches his nose] So, I bought this little slice of heaven and made my peace. I wish you all better luck.

Jesse: Joe, please. I was twelve when my brother got taken. [rises from his seat] I never got over what I lost that day, the one person in the whole world I loved the most.

Cochran: Okay, I’m gonna say this once. It’s time for you to go.

Sam: Listen, we know what took Jesse’s brother, [rises from his seat] and what took all the townspeople then and now. You know, Jesse was only a kid at the time, but he was telling the truth. What took these people was not human.

Cochran: [sceptically] How do you know?

Sam: It’s what we do.

Jesse: I saw one of the creatures today.

Cochran sits back on the chair.

Cochran: I knew she was something. I-I didn’t know what. I tracked one of those things down in ’89. It-it-it was sick and dying. I … I followed it back to its-its lair, I guess. [pauses] My daughter was there. [sobs] Couple of days before that, she had left to go back to school, I … [sobs] I don’t know what happened. But she was one of them [sobs].

Sam: Wait a second. You never reported her as missing.

Cochran: [looks to Sam and shakes his head] I knew where she was. [sobs] All the missing people were … scattered all around, dead. I think she and that other thing had killed them. [pauses] I tried … I tried talking to her, but she attacked me like some kind of rabid wolf. Teeth like thorns. I killed her.

Jesse: [angrily pushed Cochran down the chair] You son of a bitch.

Sam moves forward to get Jesse back.

Jesse: You knew the whole time! You knew where they were when everybody was suffering.

Cochran: [pushes Jesse off him] I was suffering too!

Sam: [pulls Jesse away from Cochran and tries to calm him down] Jesse. Hey, hey. Hold on. Hold on.

Cochran: You think anybody would’ve believed me? Monsters?

Jesse: [points to his head] You told me I was making it up! We could’ve told people together, found those things!

Cochran: They were already dying. All the missing people were dead.

Sam looks at Cochran sympathetically, yet upset.

Jesse: No. you didn’t wanna say that your kid was one of them, a monster, and that you …

Sam: Hey [pushes Jesse back].

Jesse: … killed her.

Sam: Jesse.

Jesse: You killed her.

Sam: Jesse, stop. Stop. [turns to Cochran] What did you do? What, did you just erase her from your life? pretend that she just went away somewhere?

Cochran: [takes a picture of his daughter from under the newspaper] Yeah, better to bury it. [voice cracks] All of it. We just let the townspeople think their loved ones had run off for a big, bright life.

Sam: Where was she? Where did you find her?

Cochran: By Taylor Creek [sobs]. The old Donnelly mine [looks and hugs the picture of his daughter].

Sam: Come on [taps Jesse’s chest and pulls him out from the living room]

Jesse looks at Cochran sympathetically before following Sam. Cochran still crying with his daughter’s photo in his arms.

EXTERIOR: The woods dark and eerie.

Dean and Cesar arrive at the burrow, that’s located in an abandoned mine. Dean finds a door, and breaks the wooden fence so he and Cesar can get in. Dean and Cesar walk into the creepy tunnel, then the go separate paths. Dean goes deeper into the mine, then he finds a woman sleeping. Her belly is big, as if she was pregnant. The woman’s skin is very pale, Dean tries to find a pulse, but he can’t feel it. When he looks to the woman’s belly, there’s something larva-like inside, and when the torch is not aiming to it, the larva glows emerald and it moves inside the woman’s belly.

Dean finds a dark tunnel in front of him, he’s about to investigate when he hears something behind him. It’s one of the creatures, pale and eyes shine green. The creature growls and attacks Dean.

On the other side of the place, Cesar is walking down the rail when he’s attacked by another creature, who grabs him down to the floor and kicks his machete off. It snarls when trying to eat Cesar. Cesar manages to kick the creature off his chest and stabs the heart, before he decapitated it.

Dean is still fighting for his life with another creature. Dean starts to use anything around him as weapon, for example, a shovel. When Dean gets to push down the creatures, he chopped his head using the shovel.

That’s the time where Cesar joins him, as the light from his torch surprised Dean, until he knows that it’s Cesar.

Dean: [sighs happily] Oh.

Cesar: [pants] I hate it when I lose my blade.

Dean: Yeah [pants]. You could’ve jumped in anytime [stands up using the shovel].

Cesar walks down to the tunnel, leaving Dean. Then he finds another woman sleeping.

Cesar: What is this place?

Dean: It’s a maternity ward/subway station. That’s home … I think that’s a tunnel.

Cesar: That’s gotta go topside eventually.

Dean: Mothers area already dead. Males weren’t protecting them, they were protection the eggs?

Cesar: They must gestate inside for years ‘til they hatch.

Dean: Yeah, well, these aren’t. I got about five gallons gasoline in the car. I’ll go pull her around.

Dean walks out from the house, while Cesar is still curious on what’s in front of him.

EXTERIOR: The Impala, her boot is opened and Dean is tightened a gasoline bottle. There’s light coming from another car. It’s Jesse and Sam.

Sam: [closes the car door] Did you guys find the burrow?

Both Dean and Cesar nod as answer.

Jesse: Where are they?

Dean: They’re in the mine. Don’t worry, they won’t be coming back out. We just gotta take care of the eggs.

Jesse: You okay?

Cesar: Hell, yeah. It’s finally over [smiles].

Dean: You wanna finish them off? [lifts the gasoline]

Jesse walks into the mine without taking Dean’s offer.

Cesar: Let’s give him a minute.

Sam nods.

INTERIOR: The burrow, there are many remains of Bisaan’s victims. Jesse was on his knees in front of one of the victims, while the other men came and give him lights.

Jess: Ah, jeez. Hey, bro. [sobs] We found Matty.

The torches aimed to an old remain of a person, and then to the lower part of its body.

Jesse: Ah, jeez. [picks something from underneath the remains] Oh, God.

Jesse opens the leather wallet, and finds the nickel is still there.

FLASHBACK: Jesse looks at the nickel the first time as a boy.

Jesse holds the nickel in his grip.

Cesar: We’ll give him a proper burial.

Jesse: [sobs] What about the others?

Torches go around the room. There are many other victims.

Dean: Don’t worry. We’ll, uh, [lifts the gasoline] we’ll take care of it.

Jesse is still crying with the nickel in his hand.

EXTERIOR: Daylight, the other side of the woods.

Cesar and Jesse preparing the burial for Matty, hunter style. Dean and Sam watch from way back.

Sam: You know, whenever you and Dad used to leave me to go hunting, and I-and I wouldn’t hear from y’all for a while, I, um, I was always sure that some vamp or rugaru, or take your pick, I always figured one of them finally got ya. I tried to think what to do, you know, the next step to take. [shakes head] I was just lost.

Dean: We came back, though, every time.

Sam: Yeah.

Dean: And look at Jesse, I mean, he turned out all right.

Sam: They’re a good team.

Cesar and Jesse smile to each other, Cesar pats Jesse’s shoulder.

Dean: They are. I was thinking, maybe they could give us a hand with Amara, you know, with Cas.

Sam: Fresh eyes. Could use the extra muscle, too.

Dean: Yeah.

Jesse light up the fire for his brother’s burial.

Cesar: You did it [places arm around Jesse’s shoulder].

Jesse: We did it [holds Cesar’s hand on his shoulder]. Thank you.

EXTERIOR: Walking path on the woods.

The four hunters walking out from the woods.

Sam: You know, it’s a good thing you guys had that fire extinguisher.

Jesse: Yeah, for a second there, I thought the whole mine was gonna go up in flames.

Cesar: Yeah, you loved it. Like twenty-seven birthdays and Christmases all in one fireball.

Dean: Well, you’re awfully upbeat for a guy who spent half the night in a cave.

Cesar: That’s because we have a deal. When we finished this hunt, if we caught them, we hang up our spurs.

Sam: Nice.

Jesse: Unless your hides need saving.

Dean: No [shakes head].

Sam turns to Dean in surprise.

Dean: [smiles] No, we’re all set.

Jesse looks at Dean, and Sam still confused. Dean looks away.

Sam: So, uh, what’s freedom look like?

Jesse: Nice little spread in New Mexico. We’ve been paying on it for years. Set foot on it about … twice?

Cesar: Gonna raise horses. And if that goes bust, Jesse used to be an EMT.

Jesse: Oh, so now I’m supporting your ass?

Cesar chuckles and looks at Jesse lovingly, before both men turns to the Winchesters. Sam follows the laugh.

Cesar: It’s time to start living.

Cesar and Jesse’s car strolls away, leaving Sam and Dean inside the Impala.

Sam: Couldn’t do it, huh?

Dean: [shakes head] No, didn’t feel right.

Sam: Yeah. I know what you mean. Two hunters who make it to the finish line?

Dean: Yeah, you leave that alone.

Dean turns the Impala’s engine on and drives away.
