NOW
INT. DINER – NIGHT

A MAN is sitting at a table, watching a suggestively-dressed WOMAN talking to a man outside. A waitress, MARLENE, tops up his coffee.

MAN:
Thank you.

MARLENE:
Sure. You've been here a couple nights in a row now.

MAN:
What can I say? I like the ambience.

MARLENE:
Get you anything else?

The MAN sees the WOMAN outside lead the man away with her arms hooked around one of his.

MAN:
No, thanks.

The MAN takes money from his pocket and we see that he is carrying a knife.

MARLENE:
Thanks. Keep safe out there.

The WOMAN and the man she is with walk between trucks parked outside the diner. The MAN with the knife follows them, knife drawn. As he walks slowly between the trucks, MARLENE appears behind him.

MARLENE:
Hey, there. You lost?

MAN:
What?

The MAN’s vision is blurry.

MAN:
Excuse me...

MARLENE:
Ooh-hoo. You're looking a little Cabo Wabo, there.

MAN:
No. No, I'm fine.

MARLENE:
No. You're not. I slipped a little special sauce into your coffee while you were watching the skirt. You do know we're venomous, right?

MARLENE's pupils become almost vertical.

MARLENE:
Looks like I didn't dose you quite hard enough. That's okay. There's more where that came from.

MARLENE smiles, revealing pointed, snake-like teeth. She throws the MAN against a truck. He falls to the ground, dropping the knife.

MARLENE:
That's for the crappy tip.

ACT ONE
Week One

INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY

SAM and DEAN are sitting silently in dim light in Rufus’ cabin, SAM in a chair and DEAN on the couch. They both have their hands in their laps and SAM is clenching his hands together. SAM looks over at DEAN, then away. When SAM is no longer looking directly at him, DEAN looks at SAM, then away.

Week Two

INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY

DEAN is drinking whiskey and looking at a clipboard holding a pad of paper on which is written “45489”, the number Bobby wrote on SAM’s hand in 7.10 Death's Door. SAM is washing dishes at the sink.

SAM takes an address book out of a drawer and opens it.

DEAN has added a list below the number:

Zip Code

Sec [?]

Lock

V-Mail

Password

Bank #

Each item is crossed out.

Week Three

INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY

DEAN pins an article titled “Biggerson’s Recalls Contaminated Meat: Customers Report Illness After Eating Turducken Slammers” to a board holding their research. Also on the board are several articles about Dick Roman.

SAM puts two duffel bags on a table and takes a beer out of the refrigerator.

SAM:
Dean, you know, um... I wonder if – if we... I mean, should we be telling people? I mean, people he knew.

DEAN:
How long ago did I give Frank these numbers? It's been a few weeks, right? What, is he nuts, or is he just being rude?

SAM:
Probably both. Dean, I-I got to ask you a question.

DEAN:
Unless, of course, something happened to him. He can't get to the phone because a Leviathan ate his face.

SAM:
Yeah, also a possibility.

DEAN:
We should go check on him.

SAM:
Dean, do you want to call Bobby's people or not?

DEAN:
W-why is – why is that our job?

SAM:
Because who else is gonna do it?

DEAN:
I'm not calling anybody. If you want to, you go right ahead.

SAM:
I don't want to call anybody. You kidding me?

A phone in one of the duffel bags rings.

DEAN:
Well, I'm not getting it.

SAM takes out the phone.

SAM:
Hello?

GIRL (V-O):
Is Bobby Singer there?

SAM:
Uh, no. He's, uh... I-I-it's not, but I'm a friend of his.

DEAN picks up a flask that was in the duffel bag, sniffs it and puts the lid back on.

GIRL (V-O):
My dad asked me to call Bobby Singer specifically.

SAM:
He's... not here, but, look, if you need s–

The GIRL hangs up.

DEAN:
Who was it?

SAM:
Just some kid.

DEAN:
For Bobby? Girl scout cookies?

SAM:
I think maybe...

DEAN picks up a full bottle of beer from the table.

SAM:
Maybe a-a hunter's kid? I mean, she sounded pretty scared. You know, I have a caller ID. Maybe we should go find her. We – we can check on her.

DEAN:
What about Frank?

SAM:
Well, Dean, I think we should go find this girl first.

DEAN:
Sam, Frank's been working on the numbers that Bobby spent his last breath on, and you want to back-burner that?

SAM looks silently at DEAN.

DEAN:
Fine. You go check out girl scout. I'll find Frank.

SAM:
Fine. But you know what? On one condition – if Frank is just spinning his wheels, then you bail out on crazy and come meet me.

DEAN looks at the beer bottle in his hand, which is now empty.

DEAN:
And thanks for drinking my entire beer.

SAM:
I didn't touch your beer. Mine's right there. You probably drank it without noticing.

DEAN:
Right.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING – DAY

A sign reads “Clarke Manor Furnished Apartments – Month to Month Rentals”.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING – DAY

SAM knocks on an apartment door.

SAM:
Hello? Um, we...spoke on the phone earlier?

The door opens to the length of a chain lock.

SAM:
Hi. Uh...I'm Sam. You sounded like you needed help, and I was in the area.

GIRL:
How'd you find me?

SAM:
Your dad is in Bobby's address book.

GIRL:
So where is he?

SAM:
Bobby? He, uh... He's passed away. Look, um –

GIRL:
Krissy.

SAM:
Krissy. I get it. You don't let strangers in. But if your dad said you could trust Bobby, then you can trust me, too.

KRISSY shuts the door, undoes the chain and opens the door again.

KRISSY:
Just so you know, 911's on speed-dial. One button.

SAM:
Yeah, sure. Note taken.

KRISSY:
So... you're a salesman, too?

SAM:
Yep. So your dad's on the road right now? Been gone a while?

KRISSY:
He usually calls every night.

SAM:
How long has it been?

KRISSY:
Five days.

SAM:
It's just you and him, huh? I know how that is. Look, um... Sometimes on the road, crap happens. So I'll help you track him down.

KRISSY:
Really?

SAM:
'Course. Did he happen to say where he was going?

KRISSY:
Said he had a couple leads near Dodge City.

SAM:
And does he have a desk or something where he keeps his stuff?

KRISSY leads SAM into another room.

SAM:
Do you mind making some coffee? Thanks.

SAM looks through the desk and then inside a closet. Behind the hanging clothes, he finds a research board with missing person notices and an article titled “Monsters In Our Midst” and “Trucker Missing, Rig Found In Ditch”.

SAM:
Krissy.

SAM walks towards the kitchen.

SAM:
Hey, listen, so I think I got an idea where to start. So I'm gonna go. Um...Can I borrow this?

SAM holds up a framed photograph of KRISSY and her dad.

KRISSY:
Yeah.

SAM:
Thanks. Here. Here's a number, in case you don't hear from me in the next couple days. Don't worry. I promise I'll check in.

KRISSY:
Don't say that. That's what my dad said.

EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN drives up and gets out of the car.

INT. FRANK’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN walks through the mostly empty house with his gun drawn.

DEAN:
This can't be good.

DEAN turns to the sound of a gun cocking and raises his own gun. FRANK is pointing a shotgun at him.

DEAN:
Well... hi.

FRANK doesn’t lower his gun.

DEAN:
Frank... we're amongst friends here. Okay, acquaintances.

FRANK:
That's just what a Leviathan would say.

ACT TWO
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN:
Frank. I'm not a Leviathan.

FRANK:
Oh, sure. You're not a Leviathan. Dick Roman's not a Leviathan. Gwyneth Paltrow is not a Leviathan.

DEAN:
Yeah?

FRANK:
Trust me.

DEAN:
Okay. You know what, Frank? I think you've been doing a little too much research.

FRANK:
They're anywhere, anyone. Who's to say this ain't the day they come for old Frank who knew too much?

DEAN:
They bleed black goo, right? You want to see what I bleed?

FRANK points his shotgun at DEAN’s foot.

DEAN:
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's take the guns out of it, okay?

FRANK:
Okay.

DEAN puts his gun on the table, takes a switchknife out of his back pocket and makes a cut on his forearm. FRANK finally lowers his shotgun.

DEAN:
See? Red-blooded American.

DEAN wipes his knife on his sleeve.

DEAN:
Now...

DEAN holds out the knife to FRANK.

DEAN:
Your turn.

FRANK:
Oh! Whoa. Look, I'm obviously not –

DEAN:
Fair's fair, douchebag.

FRANK takes the knife, makes a cut on his palm and hands the knife back to DEAN.

DEAN:
Yeah.

DEAN wipes the knife on his sleeve again.

DEAN:
I'm glad we could share that together.

FRANK:
Grab your gun, come with me. For God's sake, don't make any noise.

EXT. – DAY

DEAN and FRANK pull up at a barn containing a trailer.

INT. FRANK’S TRAILER – DAY

DEAN:
Why the downsize?

FRANK:
You! "Hey, Frank, go dig up some dirt on Richard Roman." That night, I was burned off every IP I had. Ears on my phones, eyes on my house...

DEAN:
Wait – Dick's got people watching you?

FRANK:
Do I look like I know? You think it's easy to see this deep into what's real and also be bipolar with delusional ideation? There is no pill for my situation, sweetiepop, so, yeah, best guess – the bigmouths are onto me. Next question.

DEAN:
All right. Well, what's the word on the bigmouths?

FRANK:
Their tentacles are everywhere. I-I'm looking at bankers, military high-ups...

DEAN:
This is why you didn't call me back.

FRANK:
Hey, cut me some slack. You called me like four days ago.

DEAN:
I called you four weeks ago, Frank.

FRANK:
What? No. Really? Days, weeks – quit busting my chops.

DEAN:
What, are you kidding me?

FRANK:
You cool your heels, Buster Brown.

DEAN:
Frank, I paid you fifteen grand for this.

FRANK:
Yeah, I get that –

DEAN:
No, you don't get that! Dick Roman is every card in my hit deck. You understand that? Those numbers, they got something to do with him, okay? Bobby died for those numbers.

FRANK:
Look, I'm sorry about Bobby. I really am. You know, this one time, we were in Fresno, and we got stuck –

DEAN:
No. No, no, no. I'm not gonna play "this one time with Bobby" crap, all right? I'm not gonna get all warm and fuzzy with somebody else who barely knew him.

FRANK:
Just trying to make friendly conversation.

DEAN:
This is not a friendship, Frank. I'm paying you!

FRANK:
Hey. You know what you need? A little LSD, a little shiatsu –

DEAN:
I'm out of here.

FRANK:
Hey, you want to know what those numbers are? Bupkis. They're not lottery numbers, license –

DEAN:
I know that, Frank. Thank you.

FRANK:
Which leaves us little else to do but probability generate.

DEAN:
Come again?

FRANK sits down at a computer.

FRANK:
You run most reasonable possibilities for a Levi-related five-digit number written by a dying drunk, you come up flat. Know what you start to wonder? "Hey, maybe I'm missing a number."

DEAN:
Well, how do you figure?

FRANK:
Oh, I don't know. Because Bobby was dying of brain trauma. I just had a tickle there was a reason nothing was popping out at us, so I set up a program to run possibilities for six numbers, seven, eight. But good news.

DEAN:
Good news?

FRANK:
Never had to go past six, because this...

FRANK types “454893” into the computer. (The number Bobby wrote down in 7.09 How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters was 454895.)

FRANK:
...my little lamb, is coordinates.

DEAN:
You sure? To what?

FRANK:
A field in Wisconsin.

DEAN:
No. No, Bobby didn't give us coordinates to some patch of weeds in Cheeseville.

FRANK:
No, he gave you coordinates to a parcel recently purchased by Willman, Inc., a subsidiary of [FRANK makes a trumpeting noise] Richard Roman Enterprises.

DEAN:
So what do we do?

FRANK:
Stay away. Or, if we're stupid... we go there and set up surveillance.

INT. MORGUE – DAY

MORGUE ATTENDANT:
Matthew Havlena – found in a ditch off the interstate.

SAM:
Cause of death?

MORGUE ATTENDANT:
Missing five pints of blood can't have helped. Puncture wounds – femoral arteries and carotid.

SAM:
So, what? Some kind of animal attack?

MORGUE ATTENDANT:
Or a vampire.

SAM looks at the MORGUE ATTENDANT without smiling.

MORGUE ATTENDANT:
Huh. That... usually gets at least a chuckle.

EXT. TOWN – DAY (SAM)

INT. BARN CONTAINING FRANK’S TRAILER – DAY (DEAN)

(Scene switches between the above locations)

SAM (on phone):
Find Frank?

DEAN (on phone):
Yeah. Those numbers? Coordinates. Dick bought some land. We're headed there now.

SAM (on phone):
Wait, wait, wait. You're just gonna drive right up to –

DEAN (on phone):
Relax. It's a field, not the Death Star. Dick's at a TED Conference. It's all over The Huffington Post.

SAM (on phone):
Wait, wait, wait. Since when do you read?

DEAN (on phone):
Know your enemy, Sam. What's going on with the girl?

SAM (on phone):
I don't think she even knows her dad's in the life. So far, I got three missing truckers and one blood-free body.

DEAN (on phone):
Good times. All right, well, keep me posted.

INT. BARN CONTAINING FRANK’S TRAILER – DAY

FRANK opens the trailer door.

FRANK:
Got the equipment arranged. Come and get your costume on. We can scoot.

DEAN:
"Costume"? What?

EXT. FIELD – DAY

DEAN:
What the hell's so special about this place?

FRANK:
I love a mystery. Now get up in that cherry picker and act like you're fixing something.

DEAN and FRANK are wearing gray overall uniforms and hard hats.

DEAN:
I don't know how to drive that thing.

FRANK:
You think I do?

DEAN:
Well, why do I got to be the sap that –

FRANK points to his own uniform, then to DEAN’s.

FRANK:
This one says "manager." That one says "technician." Sometime this month?

DEAN climbs up into the cherry picker.

DEAN:
Come on. Yah! Whoo!

DEAN clips a carabiner from his safety harness onto the cherry picker and puts the cherry picker in motion.

DEAN:
Okay... aaah! Up. Moving. Aah.

FRANK is looking through binoculars and sees several surveillance cameras.

FRANK:
Oh, crap. Come on down, Tarzan!

DEAN:
What?

FRANK:
Get down here. We need to move. They got this place wired up the wazoo.

DEAN:
They're watching us right now?

FRANK:
Nah, nah, they're just watching Cheech and Ed from Ma Bell.

DEAN:
You know, it's gonna be a little difficult to set up surveillance if there's, uh, surveillance everywhere.

FRANK:
Right. So we need to tap into theirs instead.

INT. FRANK’S TRAILER – NIGHT

FRANK taps some keys and the computer screen shows the field.

DEAN:
All right, now what?

FRANK:
You look horrific. When was the last time you really slept a night?

DEAN:
Let's just work, all right?

FRANK:
This is it. We watch the screens. I can take the first shift. You're no use if you can't even...

DEAN falls asleep.

FRANK:
Keep your eyes open.

DEAN’s phone vibrates in his pocket, but he doesn’t wake.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

SAM is looking at John’s journal while talking on the phone.

SAM (on phone):
Dean, hey. So I think this guy was hunting a Vetala. Um, Dad took one down back in the day. Silver knife to the heart, twist, they're done. He says they're maladjusted loner types – like to knock a guy out, drag him home, feed slow. So, if Krissy's dad got grabbed, there's a chance he might still be alive. Be nice to get this girl's dad back home to her, you know? All right, I could use your help. Call me.

INT. DINER – NIGHT

SAM:
Excuse me. Your manager said that you might be able to help me.

MARLENE:
Sure. What can I do for you?

SAM holds up a picture of KRISSY’S FATHER.

SAM:
You ever see this man?

MARLENE:
I...might have served him the other day. I think he may have gone to talk to that girl out there.

MARLENE indicates the suggestively-dressed WOMAN who KRISSY’S FATHER followed.

SAM:
Thanks.

EXT. DINER – NIGHT

SAM:
Hey! Can I talk to you for a second, uh...

SAM reads the name on the necklace the WOMAN is wearing.

SAM:
Sally? You ever see this man?

SAM holds up the picture of KRISSY’S FATHER.

SALLY:
No.

SAM:
You sure?

SALLY:
It's not safe here. Somewhere private.

SALLY walks between parked trucks and SAM follows.

SALLY:
Something's happening around here. I'm afraid I'll be next.

SAM:
Tell me what you saw.

SALLY:
I don't know what I saw.

SAM draws his knife as he hears someone approaching behind him. It is MARLENE. MARLENE grabs SAM by the wrist and throat and shoves him against a truck. SAM drops his knife.

SAM:
Sally, run!

SALLY’s pupils have become almost vertical and her teeth have become pointed. She kicks SAM’s legs and he drops to his knees. MARLENE holds SAM’s head as SALLY bites his neck. MARLENE’s pupils and teeth have also transformed. As MARLENE and SALLY drop SAM and step back, SAM falls unconscious on the ground.

ACT THREE
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN wakes in his chair. FRANK is monitoring the field on four computer screens.

DEAN:
How long was I out?

FRANK:
'Bout 36 hours.

DEAN:
What? Why didn't you wake me?

FRANK:
Not your butler. Come see this.

DEAN:
What?

FRANK:
This is where it gets good.

FRANK zooms in on a parked car in which two people are kissing.

DEAN:
Frank, you need to get out more.

FRANK:
Not that.

The screen shows a woman walking across the field. FRANK zooms in on her. She is carrying documents and a walkie-talkie.

FRANK:
Check out Sarah Palin.

DEAN:
Who is she?

FRANK:
Amanda Willer.

FRANK hits a key. AMANDA’s California driver’s license, Richard Roman Enterprises security pass and a close-up photo appear on the screen.

FRANK:
Surprise, surprise – works for Richard Roman.

FRANK hits another key. The screen shows three men in uniforms walking towards AMANDA.

DEAN:
What was she doing?

FRANK:
Being a naughty, bossy little girl.

DEAN:
Well, I hate to ask for that in the non-porno version.

FRANK:
They're surveying. They're getting ready to build something.

DEAN:
Build what?

FRANK:
Exactly. What? No idea.

DEAN:
Well, how do we find out?

On the screen the men are taking up positions on the field.

FRANK:
We watch. Patience, grasshopper.

DEAN:
Yeah, patience and me aren't exactly on terms.

FRANK:
Well, then go out and kill something or whatever you kids do to blow off steam. What, you don't like my suggestion?

DEAN:
I don't think you're in a position to be giving suggestions, all right? I think you're one tinfoil hat away from a rubber room.

FRANK:
Did I mention you look awful?

DEAN:
Yes. Maybe because somebody I cared about just got shot in the head. And this is like shoving a rock up a hill. And – screw you.

FRANK:
Here's my advice you didn't ask for – quit.

DEAN:
What?!

FRANK:
You want to keep going?

DEAN:
I want Dick Roman on a spit.

FRANK:
But you're gonna drive yourself into the ground first. Good plan.

DEAN:
[after a pause] I'm not gonna quit. It's not even an option. I'm not gonna walk out on my brother.

FRANK:
Okay, then, fine. Do what I did.

DEAN:
What? Go native? Stock up on C-rations?

FRANK:
No, cupcake. What I did when I was 26 and came home to find my wife and two kids gutted on the floor. Decide to be fine till the end of the week. Make yourself smile because you're alive and that's your job. Then do it again the next week.

DEAN:
So fake it?

FRANK:
I call it being professional. Do it right, with a smile, or don't do it.

DEAN’s phone buzzes. He listens to the message SAM left him.

SAM (recorded message):
Dean, hey. So I think this guy was hunting a Vetala. Um, Dad took one down back in the day.

DEAN:
No, no, no. Sam, that's not right.

FRANK:
What's the guff?

DEAN:
He –

SAM (recorded message):
...says they're maladjusted loner types – like to knock a guy out, drag him home –

DEAN presses a button on his phone to take a call.

DEAN (on phone):
Sam.

INT. KRISSY’S APARTMENT – DAY

KRISSY (on phone):
No. Who's this?

DEAN (on phone, V-O):
Who's this?

KRISSY (on phone):
Sam told me to call if I didn't hear anything back from him.

INT. FRANK’S TRAILER – DAY

DEAN looks very worried.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING – DAY

SAM wakes, tied to a chair. Two dead men are in the room. KRISSY’S FATHER is tied to a chair near SAM.

KRISSY’S FATHER:
That ringing in your ears – it's from the venom.

SAM:
Venom?

KRISSY’S FATHER:
Yeah. They hit you with some kind of knockout juice. You seem to be handling this pretty well.

SAM:
Yeah. Well, um... I was out there looking for you. Lee Chambers?

KRISSY’S FATHER nods.

SAM:
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's. Krissy called. She – she's fine. She is. She's just worried about you. So how do we get out of here?

LEE:
I don’t know. They'll be back pretty quick here.

SAM:
Just the two of them?

LEE:
Yeah, they're a tag team. One of them knocks you out. The other one dumps your rig or your ride or whatever miles down the road. It's a pretty nice system they got.

SAM:
They've been draining you.

LEE:
Yeah. They tap you three, four times, you're dead. And let me tell you... you can't see... you can't walk. I thought they'd kill me right off, but they don't have to. They got nothing to worry about.

SAM:
How many times they fed on you?

LEE:
Three.

INT. CHAMBERS’ APARTMENT – DAY

KRISSY:
Did Sam tell you where he was going?

DEAN:
That's what I'm trying to figure out. What did you tell him?

KRISSY:
Uh...He checked my dad's room.

DEAN:
There?

KRISSY:
Yeah.

DEAN looks around LEE’s room and turns to KRISSY, who is standing in the doorway.

DEAN:
Look, I really don't have time to hold your hand here, so –

KRISSY:
What are you saying?

DEAN:
I'm saying go wait in the living room. Your dad may not want you to know every single thing about him.

KRISSY leans on the doorway and puts a hand on her hip. DEAN opens LEE’s closet and looks behind the hanging clothes. Only the corner of a map is still pinned to the board. DEAN pulls it down.

DEAN:
Where is it?

KRISSY:
You mean everything about the job my dad was working?

DEAN:
Sam said you didn't know.

KRISSY:
Sam seemed competent, so I figured, fine – I'll do what my dad always tells me to. "Be a regular kid, don't say anything, stay out of the line of fire. Let the adults work it out." So much for that.

DEAN:
All right. Hand it over. Okay? I have had a long, long week.

KRISSY pulls out a gun and points it at DEAN.

DEAN:
All right, I get it. You're a tough kid. But I'm trying to get Sam and your dad back.

KRISSY:
My dad left, and he didn't come back. Sam left, and he didn't come back. I give you the info, you leave, you don't come back.

DEAN:
I'm coming back.

KRISSY:
I'm coming with you.

DEAN:
N-no. No. Hell, no.

KRISSY:
I'm coming! Or you're not going.

DEAN snatches the gun out of KRISSY’s hand.

KRISSY:
Ow!

DEAN:
Now hand it over.

KRISSY:
I can't. I burned it.

DEAN:
You what?

KRISSY:
But lucky for you, I memorized it all first.

EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

DEAN and KRISSY are driving in the car.

KRISSY:
Hey, I have a question.

DEAN:
All right, here's the deal. I'm a fun guy. I'm actually awesome. Okay? But right now, I'm not in the mood. I'm neck deep in some serious crap, and if this wasn't an emergency, I would drop your ass off at the nearest mall.

KRISSY:
What serious crap?

DEAN:
Revenge crap, all right? Now shut up. Eat a cookie or something.

KRISSY puts headphones in her ears, then takes them out again.

KRISSY:
One thing doesn't make sense, though. My dad's a pretty great hunter, and your brother's the size of a car, so... So how'd this thing get 'em both?

DEAN:
Vetalas usually hunt in pairs. Sam and your dad both assumed it was one thing hunting solo.

KRISSY:
Why'd they think that?

DEAN:
Because they had the wrong info. Or, best available. Our dad took down a loner years ago. Sam has his journal. Your dad must've been going on the same facts.

KRISSY:
And you know different 'cause...?

DEAN:
Because I hunted one that turned out to be two a couple years back.

KRISSY:
And you never told Sam? Wow, thanks. How 'bout sharing that with the rest of the class so we don't all get killed?

DEAN:
Sam was away at Stanford, smartass.

KRISSY:
Sam went to college? I thought you said your dad was a hunter.

DEAN:
He was. We were. Sam quit, went to college.

There is a pause as KRISSY processes this information.

DEAN:
You could, too, you know – go to college. Be a hunter/pediatrician.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING – NIGHT

SALLY enters and walks over to SAM and LEE, who are still tied to chairs.

SALLY:
Hunter day at the all-you-can-eat. How's everyone feeling? Good?

SAM and LEE don’t respond.

SALLY:
Strong silent. Fine. I don't need much entertainment with my meal.

SALLY walks over to LEE and leans down to feed on his neck.

SAM:
Hey, Sally, uh, did I tell you about the Vetalas I took down in Utah? Yeah. You remind me of them. Except they were so much...younger.

SALLY walks over to SAM.

SAM:
I tied 'em up. Not because I had to. More so... I could take my time.

SALLY:
You're lying.

SAM:
No. I just want you to know how much I enjoyed cutting up your sisters.

SALLY:
Shut up!

SALLY grabs SAM’s hair and bites into his neck.

SAM:
Aah!

SAM’s eyes roll back in his head and his eyes close.

EXT. DINER – NIGHT

DEAN and KRISSY are in the car, which is parked outside the diner.

DEAN:
You ever actually work with your dad?

KRISSY:
Sure. 'Course.

DEAN:
No, I mean work, not shoot cans in the woods.

KRISSY:
I mean, I help all the time.

DEAN:
So, no. Well, right about now, your stomach should be pretty knotted up.

KRISSY:
Not really. Look, maybe this was a lot harder for you when you were my age.

DEAN:
Oh, you think you're a good actress. You're not.

KRISSY:
What are you talking about?

DEAN:
Well, I hate to break it to you, but it's all over your face – you're scared.

KRISSY:
Quit treating me like I'm some girl. I've been prepping for this my entire life.

DEAN:
Training's one thing. Doing – whole ’nother beast.

KRISSY:
Wow. You really scared me straight. Thanks, Dean.

MARLENE walks across the parking lot and gets into the cab of a truck.

KRISSY:
Why is that waitress getting into that truck?

DEAN:
I'm not explaining the R-rated crap to you.

KRISSY:
The front of the truck, not the back, Dean.

MARLENE drives the truck away.

EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

DEAN and KRISSY have followed the truck, which is now parked by the side of a road near a building.

DEAN:
All right.

DEAN holds out his fist to KRISSY.

KRISSY:
What century is this? No one fist-bumps anymore.

DEAN:
Come on. Give it up. Good work.

DEAN wiggles his fist.

KRISSY:
You're a dweeb.

DEAN wiggles his fist again. KRISSY finally puts out her hand. DEAN grabs it and puts handcuffs on her.

KRISSY:
What the hell?

DEAN:
I got an idea.

DEAN attaches the handcuffs to the steering wheel.

DEAN:
How 'bout you stay here?

KRISSY:
Oh, you jackass.

DEAN:
Yeah, well, I'm the jackass who ain't bringing a kid in there, period.

KRISSY:
Why? I can do everything you can do.

DEAN:
I'll bring them back. Trust me.

KRISSY:
Please, they're probably dead.

DEAN:
You don't know that.

KRISSY:
It's been days. Probably just a pile of meat. I've seen it. People die, Dean. I watched my mom get torn to shreds. Let me go in there and kill them.

DEAN:
No. Sorry.

KRISSY:
You're such a hypocrite. How come you get to do it and I don't?

DEAN:
Because I'm the grown-up!

DEAN holds out a hand.

DEAN:
Give it to me.

KRISSY:
What?

DEAN:
Your lock pick. I will frisk you.

KRISSY hands something over to DEAN.

DEAN:
Thank you.

DEAN gets out of the car and walks away.

EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING – NIGHT

DEAN picks the lock and enters.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING – NIGHT

DEAN sees one of the dead men, then sees SAM, LEE and a third man tied to chairs. SALLY is standing next to the third man and MARLENE next to LEE. SAM is still unconscious.

MARLENE:
Good thing we picked up a new one. This one's about tapped out. You want to finish him together?

SALLY:
Sure. Love to.

DEAN grabs a metal bar and hits SALLY, who falls to the ground. He draws his knife as MARLENE advances on him.

MARLENE:
Not so fast.

DEAN swings at MARLENE, but she hits him and he drops his knife. She slams him against a metal cage and grabs him by the throat. SAM wakes. DEAN grabs another metal bar and hits MARLENE. She falls to the ground. DEAN picks up his knife.

KRISSY:
Dad, hold on – I got you!

KRISSY runs across the room, but SALLY grabs her leg.

LEE:
No!

SALLY gets up, pulls KRISSY behind LEE and SAM, and holds KRISSY from behind. DEAN is holding his knife to MARLENE’s throat.

SALLY:
Let her go... or Little Miss Sunshine here gets it.

SALLY’s eyes and teeth transform. DEAN takes his knife away from MARLENE’s throat. She hurries over to stand behind LEE. SALLY’s eyes and teeth return to normal.

ACT FOUR
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING – NIGHT

LEE:
What were you thinking, bringing her here?

DEAN walks towards SALLY and KRISSY.

SALLY:
Now drop the knife!

DEAN puts the knife on the floor.

DEAN:
She's just a child. Let her go.

SALLY:
Yeah, I don't think we'll be letting anyone go.

KRISSY:
Daddy...

LEE:
It's okay, baby. Everything's gonna be fine.

MARLENE:
All right. Enough with the family bonding. It's time for you to shut up.

MARLENE bites into LEE’s neck.

KRISSY:
Daddy, no! Dean!

SALLY:
He can't help you. No one can.

KRISSY pulls a knife out of her sleeve, spins around and stabs SALLY.

KRISSY:
I guess I'll have to help myself, then.

KRISSY twists the knife. SALLY’s body turns grey and her teeth transform. She falls to the floor dead. MARLENE advances on DEAN, who picks up his knife. KRISSY cuts the ropes binding SAM. SAM takes KRISSY’s knife and stabs MARLENE as she turns from DEAN to him. He twists the knife. MARLENE's teeth transform and her body turns black as she dies. KRISSY works on the ropes binding LEE, who is unconscious.

KRISSY:
Bad actress, huh?

DEAN:
Yeah, I take it back.

EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY

INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

SAM and DEAN are walking down a hallway. They enter a room that KRISSY is sitting outside. LEE is in a hospital bed in the room.

LEE:
Yeah, I was hoping you'd stop by. I wanted to thank you.

SAM:
It's no problem.

LEE:
No, you saved my life. Krissy's, too.

SAM:
Actually, uh, she kind of saved ours.

DEAN:
Don't thank us. Quit. Your daughter's 14 years old. She's already a hunter with a-a kill under her belt. I'm not trying to be a dick, but what do you think that does to her life span? She could still be a regular kid.

LEE:
You know, I got into this for a reason.

DEAN:
I know. Your family. That's the same reason you should get out now.

LEE:
I can't. You ever know anyone who left the life?

DEAN:
No. They all get killed first.

SAM:
Well, uh... we should probably let you get some rest.

LEE:
Yeah.

LEE raises a hand in farewell.

EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY

SAM and DEAN exit the hospital, followed by KRISSY.

KRISSY:
Dean! Thanks for saying bye, asshat.

SAM walks over to the car, leaving DEAN and KRISSY to talk.

DEAN:
Oh, what? Now you're sentimental?

KRISSY:
No. Just wanted to tell you that you're kind of amusing for an old man.

DEAN:
How'd you get out of them cuffs, anyway?

KRISSY:
Girl's got to have her secrets.

DEAN:
Bobby pin. You know, you could've gotten yourself killed.

KRISSY:
I saved your bacon.

DEAN:
My point stands. But yes.

KRISSY:
So... Guess I'm retiring – one and done.

DEAN:
Really? How you feel about that?

KRISSY:
Who knows? Maybe I'll go to Stanford like Sam.

KRISSY holds out her fist to DEAN, who bumps it.

KRISSY:
We're so lame.

DEAN:
Yeah, we are. Take care of yourself.

DEAN walks over to the car, where SAM is waiting by the passenger side. KRISSY goes back into the hospital.

ACT FIVE
EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are driving in the car.

SAM:
You know what? Good for them.

DEAN:
Yeah. It's nice to walk away from someone and feel like they could be okay. How about you? How you doing? You all right?

SAM:
No. I'm definitely not. But, you know, I mean, um, I think, maybe... I just want to work.

DEAN nods.

SAM:
Should I even ask?

DEAN:
I'm fine.

SAM:
"Fine," meaning...?

DEAN:
You're right. We should just... work, right? And figure out a way to kick Dick Roman's ass. Well, hey, we are the professionals.

SAM turns on music and leans against the passenger door to sleep. DEAN smiles sadly as he drives.
