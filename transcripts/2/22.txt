NOW
INTERIOR. It's daytime outside (as seen through the windows).

We see SAM's dead body.

DEAN is standing near, looking at SAM's body.

BOBBY (arrives, holding a bucket of fried chicken) Dean? Brought you this back.

DEAN No, thanks. I'm fine.

BOBBY You should eat something.

DEAN I said I'm fine.

DEAN takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey.

BOBBY Dean... I hate to bring this up, I really do. But don't you think maybe it's time... we bury Sam?

DEAN No.

BOBBY We could (Sighs) maybe...

DEAN (calmly) What? Torch his corpse? Not yet.

BOBBY I want you to come with me.

DEAN I'm not going anywhere.

BOBBY Dean, please.

DEAN Would you cut me some slack?

BOBBY I just don't think you should be alone, that's all. I gotta admit, I could use your help.

DEAN snorts

BOBBY Something big is going down – end-of-the world big.

DEAN (yelling)
Well, then let it end!

BOBBY You don't mean that.

DEAN (gets up and stands in BOBBY's face)
You don't think so? Huh? You don't think I've given enough? You don't think I've paid enough? I'm done with it. All of it. And if you know what's good for you, you'd turn around, and get the hell out of here.

BOBBY stands there, shaking his head.

DEAN (shoving BOBBY suddenly)
Go! (yelling)
(pause, then contritely:
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, just go.

BOBBY (turning around, sighing)
You know where I'll be.

He turns his back on Dean and leaves the room. Dean swallows hard, and looks at SAM's body; a tear falls from his eye.


TITLE CARD SUPERNATURAL
ACT ONE
FADE IN: WOODS. NIGHT

JAKE is sitting in a campsite with a fire burning. He is dozing off, but awakes suddenly to see the Yellow Eyed Demon standing in front of him.)

YED Howdy, Jake.

JAKE I'm—I'm dreaming, aren't I?

YED

(to himself) I got a genius on my hands. Well congratulations, Jake. You're it—last man standing. The American Idol. I have to admit, you weren't the horse I was bettin' on, but still, I gotta give it to you.

JAKE Go... to hell.

YED Been there. Done that.

JAKE Everything you put me through—dragging me to that place, making me kill those people...

YED All part of the beauty pageant. Jake, I needed the strongest, and that's you.

JAKE Needed me for what?

YED Oh, I got a laundry list of tasty things for you.

JAKE The only thing I'm gonna do is wake up, hunt you down, and kill you myself.

YED You know, others have tried. It's not easy. Trust me, Jake. You want to be a good little soldier here.

JAKE And if I'm not?

YED If you're a bad little soldier, well, that dear old mom of yours, that adorable little sister ... I'll make certain that they both live long enough to know the chewy taste of their own intestines. (pause) No, Jake. I'm not bluffing.

JAKE What do you want me to do?

YED Like I said – genius.


CUT TO

SAM'S corpse lying on a mattress. DEAN sitting next to him, grieving.

DEAN
You know, when we were little— and you couldn't been more than 5— you just started asking questions. How come we didn't have a mom? Why do we always have to move around? Where'd Dad go when he'd take off for days at a time? I remember I begged you, "Quit asking, Sammy. Man, you don't want to know."
I just wanted you to be a kid... Just for a little while longer. I always tried to protect you... Keep you safe... Dad didn't even have to tell me. It was just always my responsibility, you know? It's like I had one job... I had one job...
And I screwed it up. (pause) I blew it. And for that, I'm sorry. (wipes tears from his face)
I guess that's what I do. I let down the people I love. I let Dad down. And now I guess I'm just supposed to let you down, too.
How can I? How am I supposed to live with that?
(crying)
What am I supposed to do? Sammy. God.
What am I supposed to do? (inhales sharply)
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?! (yelling)


CUT TO:

Nighttime. Impala engine revving. Headlights turn on and DEAN drives recklessly, looking pale and determined. He stops on a dirt road and inserts several items into a box, including a (fake) photo ID of himself. He buries the box in the middle of a crossroads and stands. Several seconds pass in silence, as DEAN looks right and left.

DEAN Oh come on already. Show your face, you bitch!

(Suddenly, a beautiful woman in a black dress appears.)

DEMON Easy sugar, you'll wake the neighbors. (She flashes red eyes for a moment.) Dean. It is so, so good to see you. (Inhales sharply) I mean it. Look at you. Gone and got your family killed. All alone in the world. It's too sweet. Excuse me, you're gonna have to give me a moment. (She walks to Dean, face to face, close.) Sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses.

DEAN I should send you straight back to hell.

DEMON Oh, you should. But you won't. And I know why.

DEAN Oh yeah?

DEMON Yeah. Following in Daddy's footsteps. You wanna make a deal. Little Sammy back from the dead, and—let me guess— you're offering up your own soul?

DEAN There are a hundred other demons who'd love to get their hands on it. And it's all yours. All you got to do is bring Sam back. And give me ten years— ten years, and then you come for me.

DEMON You must be joking.

DEAN That's the same deal you give everybody else.

DEMON You're not everybody else. (Whispering in Dean's ear) Why would I want to give you anything? Keep your gutter soul. It's too tarnished, anyway.

DEAN (nodding) Nine years.

DEMON No.

DEAN Eight.

DEMON (laughs) You keep going, I'll keep saying no.

DEAN Okay, five years. Five years, and my bill comes due. That's my last offer— five years or no deal.

DEMON (Leaning in as if for a kiss) Then no deal.

DEAN Fine.

DEMON Fine. (Walking away) Make sure you bury Sam before he starts stinking up the joint.

DEAN (flinches) Wait.

DEMON (Softly) It's a fire sale, and everything must go.

DEAN What do I have to do?

DEMON First of all, quit groveling. Needy guys are such a turnoff.
(Sighs)
Look... Look, I shouldn't be doing this. I could get in a lot of trouble. But what can I say? I got a blind spot for you, Dean. You're like a... puppy. You're just too fun to play with.
(Sighs)
I'll do it.

DEAN You'll bring him back?

DEMON I will. And because I'm such a saint, I'll give you one year, and one year only. But here's the thing. If you try and welch or weasel your way out, then the deal is off. Sam drops dead. He's back to rotten meat in no time. So... It's a better deal than your dad ever got. What do you say?

DEAN grabs the demon and kisses her to seal the deal.


CUT TO:

SAM's eyes open wide and he sits up on the mattress, looking around, confused, and breathing heavily.


ACT TWO
FADE IN: MOTEL ROOM (dawn or early morning)

SAM is standing in front of a mirror, examining his back, wincing, with a look of pain. There is a scar from where the knife was stabbed into his spine. In the distance a door opens and DEAN enters the room.

DEAN Sammy? Thank god.

SAM Hey.

DEAN pulls SAM into a tight embrace.

SAM Owwww. Uh, Dean...

DEAN (Releases SAM) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. I'm just... I'm just happy to see you up and around, that's all. (SAM nods, looking puzzled.) Come on, sit down. (Both sit)

SAM Okay. Dean... what happened to me?

DEAN Well, what do you remember?

SAM I-I saw you and Bobby, and... I felt this pain. This sharp pain, like... white-hot, you know, and then you started running at me, and... that's about it.

DEAN Yeah, that— that kid, stabbed you in the back. You lost a lot of blood, you know.... It was pretty touch and go for awhile.

SAM But Dean, you can't— you can't patch up a wound that bad.

DEAN No, Bobby could. Who was that kid, anyway?

SAM His name's Jake. Did you get him?

DEAN No, he disappeared into the woods.

SAM We got to find him, Dean. And I swear I'm gonna tear that son of a bitch apart. (SAM stands up with DEAN following suit.)

DEAN Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, Van Damme. You just woke up, all right? Let's get you something to eat. Huh? You want something to eat? (SAM nods) I'm starving. Come on.


CUT TO:

DEAN and SAM sitting at a table, eating.

SAM And that's when you guys showed up.

DEAN That's awful. Poor Andy.

SAM The demon said he only wanted one of us to walk out alive.

DEAN He told you that?

SAM Yep. (Scoffs) He appeared in a dream.

DEAN He tell you anything else?

SAM (Shakes head) No. No. That was it. Nothing else. You know, what I don't get, Dean, is if the demon only wanted one of us, then how did Jake and I both get away?

DEAN Well, I mean, they left you for dead. I'm sure they thought it was over. (Eats a large bite of pizza and turning away) So now that Yellow Eyes has Jake, what's he gonna do with him?

SAM I don't know. But whatever it is, we got to stop him.

DEAN Well, hold on. You need to get your rest. We got time.

SAM No, we don't.

DEAN Sam, oceans aren't boiling, okay? Frogs aren't raining from the sky. Let's get you your strength back first.

SAM Well did you call the roadhouse? They know anything?

DEAN Yeah. (looks away)

SAM Dean... what is it?

DEAN (Sitting down) The roadhouse burned to the ground. Ash is dead. Probably Ellen— a lot of other hunters, too.

SAM (tears in his eyes) Demons?

DEAN Yeah, we think so. We think because Ash found something.

SAM What did he find?

DEAN Bobby's working on that right now.

SAM Well, come on then. Bobby's only a few hours away. (SAM begins to stand.)

DEAN (DEAN stands also and grabs SAM by the shoulders.) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, Sam, stop! Damn it. You almost died in there. I mean, what would I 've — can't you just take care of yourself for a little bit, huh? Just for a little bit?

SAM I'm sorry. No.

DEAN shakes his head.

CUT TO:

Impala driving down a road.


CUT TO:

A hand knocking on a door. BOBBY opens the door and looks at SAM with astonishment.

DEAN Hey, Bobby. (He looks at BOBBY and looks away again almost immediately.)

SAM Hey, Bobby.

BOBBY Sam. It's good to ... see you up and around.

SAM Yeah ... thanks for patching me up. (SAM pats BOBBY on the shoulder and walks past him into the house.)

BOBBY Don't mention it. (DEAN follows. BOBBY looks at him hard, vibrating with unspoken emotion.)

DEAN (stiffly) Well Sam's better. And we're back in it now, so... what do you know?

SAM looks at DEAN curiously.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE

BOBBY Well, I found something. But I'm not sure what the hell it means.

SAM What is it?

BOBBY Demonic omens... like a frickin' tidal wave. Cattle deaths. Lightning storms. They skyrocketed from out of nowhere. Here. (He points to Wyoming on a map.) All around here, except for one place... Southern Wyoming.

DEAN Wyoming?

BOBBY Yeah. That one area's totally clean – spotless. It's almost as if...

SAM What?

BOBBY The demons are surrounding it.

DEAN But you don't know why?

BOBBY No, and by this point my eyes are swimming. Sam, would you take a look at it? Maybe you could catch something I couldn't.

SAM Yeah, sure.

BOBBY Come on, Dean. I got some more books in the truck. Help me lug 'em in.

DEAN Yeah.


CUT TO:

DEAN and BOBBY walking in the junkyard. Finally, BOBBY stops and turns to face DEAN.

BOBBY You stupid ass! What did you do? (DEAN looks away.) What did you do?! (He pushes DEAN.) You made a deal... For Sam, didn't you? How long did they give you?

DEAN Bobby.

BOBBY How long?!

DEAN One year.

BOBBY Damn it, Dean.

DEAN Which is why we gotta find this yellow-eyed son of a bitch. That's why I'm gonna kill him myself. I mean, I got nothing to lose now, right?

BOBBY (He grabs DEAN by the collar) I could throttle you!

DEAN What, and send me downstairs ahead of schedule?

BOBBY (He lets go of DEAN) What is it with you Winchesters, huh? You, your dad. You're both just itching to throw yourselves down the pit.

DEAN That's my point. Dad brought me back, Bobby. I'm not even supposed to be here. At least this way, something good could come out of it, you know? I--I--It's like my life could mean something.

BOBBY What? And it didn't before?! Have you got that low of an opinion of yourself? Are you that screwed in the head?! (He grabs DEAN again)

DEAN (Choking up) I couldn't let him die, Bobby. I couldn't. He's my brother.

BOBBY How is your brother gonna feel when he knows your going to hell? How'd you feel when you knew your dad went for you?

DEAN You can't tell him. You take a shot at me, whatever you got to do, but please don't tell him.

BOBBY begins to cry, grabbing DEAN'S chin. Suddenly there is a clank from a distant part of the junkyard. BOBBY and DEAN crawl to the side of a car, and grab the intruder. Once they have her by the shoulders, they recognize her as ELLEN.

DEAN Ellen? (ELLEN nods, starting to cry) Ellen. Oh, God. (They embrace.)


ACT THREE
CUT TO:

ELLEN and BOBBY sitting at a table. He pours her a shot of liquid from a flask and pushes it towards her.


ELLEN Bobby, is this really necessary?

BOBBY Just a belt of Holy Water. Shouldn't hurt.

ELLEN

(She lifts the shot glass to her mouth and swallows the water) Whiskey now, if you don't mind.

DEAN Ellen, what happened? How'd you get out?

ELLEN I wasn't supposed to. I was supposed to be in there with everybody else.
(Scoffs)
But we ran out of pretzels, of all things. It was just dumb luck.
(She drinks the whiskey BOBBY poured for her and exhales sharply)
Anyway, that's when Ash called. Panic in his voice.
(Sighs)
He told me to look in the safe. Then the call cut out. By the time I got back, the flames were sky-high. And everybody was dead. I couldn't have been gone more than fifteen minutes.

SAM Sorry, Ellen.

ELLEN
(Tearing up)
A lot of good people died in there. And I got to live.
(Scoffs)
Lucky me.

BOBBY Ellen, you mentioned a safe.

ELLEN A hidden safe we keep in the basement.

BOBBY Demons get what was in it?

ELLEN No

(She pulls out a map from her pocket, unfolding it and setting it down on the table. It has several black lines and X's on it.)

DEAN Wyoming. What does that mean? (Pointing to the lines)


CUT TO:

BOBBY is reading from a large book

BOBBY I don't believe it. (He sets the book on a table)

SAM What? You got something?

BOBBY A lot more than that. Each of these X's (He points to the marks on the map) Is an abandoned frontier church— all mid-19th century. And all of them built by Samuel Colt.

DEAN Samuel Colt— the demon-killing, gunmaking Samuel Colt?

BOBBY Yep. And there's more. He built private railway lines (He points to the black lines on the map) connecting church to church. It just happens to lay out like this. (He connects the points on the map until the shape of a star is made.)

DEAN Tell me that's not what I think it is.

SAM It's a Devil's Trap. A 100-square mile Devil's Trap.

DEAN That's brilliant. Iron lines demons can't cross.

ELLEN I've never heard of anything that massive.

BOBBY No one has.

DEAN And after all these years none of the lines are broken? I mean, it still works?

SAM Definitely

DEAN How do you know?

SAM All those omens Bobby found. I mean the demons, they must be circling and they can't get in.

BOBBY Yeah, well... they're trying.

ELLEN Why? What's inside?

DEAN That's what I've been looking for. And, uh, there's nothing except an old cowboy cemetery right in the middle.

SAM Well what's so important about a cemetery or... what's Colt trying to protect?

DEAN Well, unless ...

BOBBY Unless what?

DEAN What if Colt wasn't trying to keep the demons out? What if he was trying to keep something in?

ELLEN Now that's a comforting thought.

DEAN Yeah, you think?

SAM Could they do it, Bobby? Could they get inside?

BOBBY This thing's so powerful, you'd practically need an A-bomb to destroy it. No way a full-blood demon gets across.

SAM No. (Pause) But I know who could.



EXT. WOODS - DAY

JAKE pulls onto a backroad and parks his car in front of a railroad track. He gets out of the car and looks around. After a few moments, Jake turns around and sees the Yellow Eyed Demon standing behind him.

YED Howdy, Jake. So, did you have a nice trip?

JAKE I'm here. I did what you asked. Now what?

YED Fifty miles, thataway. (He points in the opposite direction JAKE is standing, across the railroad tracks) There's a cemetery. A crypt. You got to open that for me. Think you can manage that, sport?

JAKE You know what? Screw you and your freaky orders. Go do it yourself.

YED Oh, I can't. I can't go that way— not yet.

JAKE Why not?

YED I just can't. But if you're gonna open that crypt for me, you're gonna need a key. (He pulls the Colt from his jacket pocket and holds it in the air.)

JAKE A gun?

YED Oh, this isn't just any gun, Jake. This is the only gun in the whole universe that can shoot me dead. (Pointing the gun to his head)

JAKE Is that so?

YED Yep. Here, take it.

(He hands the Colt over to JAKE, who cocks the gun and aims it at him.)

Oh, my. I'm shocked at this unforeseen turn of events. Go ahead, Jake. Squeeze that trigger. Be all you can be. This'll all be over. Your life can go back to normal. Of course, the Army won't take you back 'cause you're AWOL. But I'm sure you could get your old job at the factory back. But then, on the other hand, the rest of your life, and your family's, could be money and honey, health and wealth, every day is ice-cream sundae. And all you got to do is this one little thing.

JAKE Why me?

YED Oh, Jake. It's got to be you. I've been waiting for you for a very long time. You're my leader. You open that crypt, and you will have your army.

JAKE You're talking about the end of the world.

YED No, not the end— the beginning... a better world, where your family will be protected. More than that. They'll be royalty. Buddy boy, you have the chance to get in on the ground floor of a thrilling opportunity. Whaddya say? It's your call.
(JAKE lowers the gun)
Attababy.



CUT TO:

Nighttime. A cemetery gate opens and JAKE enters, walking towards a crypt. DEAN is shown standing behind a large tomb, a gun in hand.

SAM Howdy, Jake.

SAM, BOBBY, and ELLEN appear from the shadows, guns raised.

JAKE Wait... you were dead. I killed you.

SAM Yeah? Well next time, finish the job.

JAKE I did! I cut clean through your spinal cord, man. (SAM glances at DEAN, who lowers his eyes briefly) You can't be alive. You can't be.

BOBBY Okay, just take it real easy there, son.

JAKE And if I don't?

SAM Wait and see.

JAKE What, you a tough guy all of a sudden? What are you gonna do— kill me?

SAM It's a thought.

JAKE You had your chance. You couldn't.

SAM I won't make that mistake twice.

JAKE begins to laugh.

DEAN What are you smiling at, you little bitch?

JAKE Hey Lady, do me a favor. Put that gun to your head.
(ELLEN shakily points her gun at her temple)
See that Ava girl was right. Once you give in to it, there's all sorts of new Jedi mind tricks you can learn.

SAM Let her go.

ELLEN (Voice trembling) Shoot him.

JAKE You'll be mopping up skull before you get a shot off.
(Pauses)
Everybody, put your guns down. Except you, sweetheart.
(Three guns drop)
Okay. Thank you.

JAKE turns around and pulls the Colt out of his pocket. While he is inserting it into the crypt, DEAN and BOBBY grab ELLEN before she can shoot herself just as SAM shoots JAKE four times in the back. JAKE falls onto the ground, and SAM walks to stand over him.

JAKE (Gasping) Please... don't. Please.

SAM shoots JAKE three more times in the chest. Blood spatters onto his face. ELLEN and BOBBY walk past SAM, with BOBBY staring at him hard. DEAN walks over to look at JAKE, then SAM, who wipes the blood from his face.

The four look over to the crypt as two separate engravings on the crypt spin in different directions, then stop.

BOBBY Oh, no.

ELLEN Bobby, what is it?

BOBBY It's hell.

DEAN pulls the Colt from the Crypt.

BOBBY Take cover— now!

All four run behind tombstones as the doors to the crypt burst open. A large black mass erupts from the other side and shoots outward. The camera spans out and shows the demons breaching the Devil's Trap and escaping.

ACT FOUR
Black demon smoke continues to pour from the crypt, with individual trails of smoke haring off in different directions. BOBBY and ELLEN, DEAN and SAM are taking cover behind some tombstones nearby.

DEAN What the hell just happened?!

ELLEN That's a devil's gate. A damn door to hell.

The railway iron is shown being bent in two and a pair of legs crossing, while a black demon smoke trail goes out the other way.

ELLEN Come on! We gotta shut that gate!

DEAN checks the Colt for bullets.

DEAN If the demon gave this to Jake... then maybe...

Thunder crashes and the Yellow Eyed Demon appears behind DEAN. He flings the Colt out of DEAN's hand and into his own. Dean looks astonished.

YED Boys shouldn't play with Daddy's guns.

He throws DEAN into the air, where DEAN hits his head on a tombstone and lies there, stunned.

BOBBY, ELLEN, and SAM are struggling to close the crypt door. SAM looks over and sees DEAN down, and then sees the YED who looks at SAM and smiles.

SAM Dean!

He lets go of the gate door and runs toward his brother.

YED (Throwing SAM against a nearby tree.)
I'll get to you in a minute, champ. But I'm proud of you— knew you had it in you.
(DEAN is struggling upright. The YED throws him against a post.)
Sit a spell.
So, Dean... I gotta thank you. You see, demons can't resurrect people, unless a deal is made. I know, red tape— it'll make you nuts. But thanks to you, Sammy's back in rotation.
(Laughs)
Now, I wasn't counting on that, but I'm glad. I liked him better than Jake, anyhow. Tell me— have you ever heard the expression, "If a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is?"

DEAN You call that deal good?

YED Well, it's a better shake than your dad ever got. And you never wondered why? I'm surprised at you. I mean... (YED approaches DEAN to speak to him face-to-face) you saw what your brother just did to Jake, right? That was pretty cold, wasn't it?
(Chuckles)
How certain are you that what you brought back, is 100%, pure, Sam?
(SAM, watching, looks horrified; it's not clear whether or not he can hear their conversation. In addition to black demon smoke, what appears to be ghosts are now also walking.)
(Laughs)
You of all people should know, that's what's dead, should stay dead. Anyway... thanks a bunch. I knew I kept you alive for some reason. Until now, anyway. I couldn't have done it without your pathetic, self-loathing, self-destructive desire to sacrifice yourself for your family.

As the YED cocks the Colt and aims it at DEAN, JOHN WINCHESTER grabs the demon from behind. The body the demon possessed falls to the ground, the gun still in hand, while JOHN and the cloud of smoke that was the YED wrestle. The demon pushes him to the ground and enters the body once more. When he stands up, DEAN is pointing the COLT at him, and shoots him in the heart. The demon then falls to the ground, dead.

BOBBY and ELLEN finally close the gate doors and turn to see JOHN. DEAN stands up and faces his dad. JOHN walks forward, and smiles at DEAN, putting his hand on DEAN's shoulder. Both are teary, and SAM approaches; DEAN and JOHN both look at SAM, and JOHN and SAM nod at each other. With another look at DEAN, John steps back and disappears into white light.

DEAN and SAM look at each other.


ACT FIVE
CUT TO:

DEAN and SAM stand over the demon's smoking body, astonished.

DEAN Well, check that off the to-do list. (laughs a little)

SAM You did it.

DEAN I didn't do it alone.

SAM Do you think Dad really... do you think he really climbed outta hell?

DEAN The door was open. If anyone's stubborn enough to do it... it would be him.

SAM Where do you think he is now?

DEAN I don't know.

SAM I kind of can't believe it, Dean. I mean... our whole lives, everything... has been prepping for this, and now I... (Chuckles) I kind of don't know what to say.

DEAN I do. (He leans closer to the body) That was for our mom... you son of a bitch.


CUT TO:

SAM and DEAN walking towards the Impala. DEAN opens the door.

SAM You know, when Jake saw me... it was like he saw a ghost. (DEAN, stopping, shuts the door to stand next to SAM and hear him.) (Scoffs) I mean, hell, you heard him, Dean. He said he killed me.

DEAN Glad he was wrong.

SAM I don't think he was, Dean. (pause; SAM looks at DEAN) What happened? After I was stabbed?

DEAN I already told you.

SAM Not everything.

DEAN Sam, we just killed the demon. Can we celebrate for a minute?

SAM Did I die?

DEAN Oh, come on.

SAM Did you sell your soul for me, like Dad did for you?

DEAN Oh, come on! No!

SAM (continuing to look at DEAN)
Tell me the truth.
(DEAN sniffs)
Dean, tell me the truth.

DEAN Sam... (Chuckles)

SAM (Voice breaking) How long do you get?

DEAN One year. (SAM nods, tears in his eyes.) I got one year.

SAM You shouldn't've done that. How could you do that?

DEAN Don't get mad at me. Don't you do that. I had to. I had to look out for you. That's my job.

SAM And what do you think my job is?

DEAN What?

SAM You've saved my life over and over. I mean, you sacrifice everything for me. Don't you think I'd do the same for you? You're my big brother. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. And I don't care what it takes, I'm gonna get you out of this. Guess I gotta save your ass for a change.

DEAN Yeah.

ELLEN (Approaching) Well... Yellow-Eyed Demon might be dead. But a lot more got through that gate.

DEAN How many you think?

SAM Hundred. Maybe two hundred. It's an army. He's unleashed an army.

BOBBY Hope to hell you boys are ready. 'Cause the war has just begun.

DEAN Well, then ... (smiling)

The scene cuts to SAM and DEAN opening the Impala's trunk. DEAN throws the Colt inside and closes it.

DEAN ... we got work to do.
