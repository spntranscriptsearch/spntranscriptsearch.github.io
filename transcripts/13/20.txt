TEASER
NOW

[exterior, an alley behind a liquor store in Central City, Colorado. A man staggers along finishing a bottle of liquor when strange music begins playing. He stops and looks around for the source]
GABRIEL: Fenrir Odensbane! [Gabriel steps out from behind a dumpster and plays the tune again on a kazoo]
FENRIR: Gabriel. I assume you're not here to apologize. [he tosses his bottle away and they face off]
GABRIEL: Ya think?
[Gabriel opens his coat to reveal a wooden sword, and Fenrir’s face flashes with a glowing yellow wolf face and snarls]
GABRIEL: I vowed to do this honorably. No gimmicks. No tricks. Just mano… a-mano.
[Gabriel swings the sword around and Fenrir’s hands extend into claws as funky music plays and they prepare to fight]
GABRIEL: Here, boy.
FENRIR: [wolf growling noises, as Fenrir cuts Gabriel’s hand]
GABRIEL: Ha!
FENRIR: Never known an archangel to bleed.
GABRIEL: [sighs] Ya got me.
[they continue to fight and Gabriel is wounded in the side but vanquishes Fenrir with his wooden sword. He pulls out a slip of paper with a list of names on it and crosses out Fenrir’s with a bloody finger, and then walks away]

TITLE CARD

ACT I

[interior, motel room, where Sam is unpacking and Dean’s on the phone with Cas]
DEAN: Yeah. No, we just got in. Mm-hmm.
DEAN, to SAM: What are you doing? Don't unpack.
SAM: Dude, we could be here for days.
DEAN: No. No. Hey, hell, no.
DEAN [again to Cas over the phone]: Hey -- No, not you. That's… Just call us when you get to Amarillo, all right?
[he disconnects his call]
DEAN: All right, look, Rowena's spell said that Gabriel would be here.
SAM: Yeah, here or in Texas.
DEAN: Yeah, she tracked his essence-- which, gross-- to both places. So Cas is gonna hit up the Lone Star State in a few hours, and we will check this place out.
SAM: Okay. And that could take some time.
DEAN: Which we don't have. Look, I know you know that we've been following leads for the past two weeks. We have nothing to show for it. Meanwhile, Mom, Jack, they could be hurt. Or worse. And we're stuck here in this stupid motel room… doing...
[Dean kicks the bed Sam’s sitting on, activating the magic fingers vibration, and Sam jumps to his feet. Dean kicks the bed again and the vibration stops, and Dean points at the bed]
DEAN: Bonus.
[Sam gives Dean a get-on-with-it look]
DEAN: ...looking for some runaway, dumbash archangel who doesn't wanna be found.
[there’s a knock at the door and they arm themselves and open the door to find Gabriel, injured and bleeding]
GABRIEL: Hey, fellas. Looking for me?

[exterior, the Apocalypse World, Jack and Mary walking through the forest together]
JACK: Balthazar's army attacked, but we were ready. And then I… I killed him.
MARY: And Bobby?
JACK: Well, he'll be back in a few days with the people that we saved.
MARY: How many?
JACK: 30 at least. You're not happy? This is the third battle in a row that we've won.
MARY: Jack, I know. I… We're running out of space and supplies. And now with all those new people, I just...don't know how we're gonna take care of everybody.
[there’s a rustling in the woods nearby, and Mary instantly draws her gun and aims it at a man with raised arms]
JAKOB: Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
MARY: What is it, Jakob?
JAKOB: Just got word from the eyes outside Michael's fortress.
MARY: And?
JAKOB: They're saying the angels, they're leaving.
JACK: Why would they leave?

[interior, the motel room, where Sam is bandaging the wound on Gabriel’s side]
SAM: All right, this is gonna hurt a little bit.
GABRIEL: A little?
DEAN: How'd you know we were here?
GABRIEL: Come on. I felt your witch's tracking spell the second she laid it on me. Tasted like haggis.
SAM: So now you're in trouble?
GABRIEL: What gave you that idea?
DEAN: You show up on our doorstep, bleeding like a stuck pig.
GABRIEL: This? Eh, you know, you… roll into town for a little R&R, stumble into the wrong poker game, take a guy's money, his wife… things get messy.
SAM: You're trying to tell us you came here for R&R?
DEAN: Yeah, this isn't exactly the Riviera.
GABRIEL: I know, right? Huh. Yeah, so anyway, um… I don't suppose you guys have any more of my grace laying around, right? 'Cause, uh, the tank's a little low.
SAM: Oh, did you drain it killing Asmodeus?
GABRIEL: And ditching you. It'll recharge. Eventually. But, uh, until then...
DEAN: Whatever we didn't use on you, we used to open up a rift.
GABRIEL: Cool. Superdupes. Okay. Well, uh, in that case, gentlemen, I must bid you a fond adi-- [he tries to stand and clutches his injured side and cries in pain] Ohh! Yeah, nope. Maybe after a… little siesta. [he flops over onto the sofa] Whoa. Aw. Aw, crap.

[exterior, the alley from the teaser where two men have found Fenrir’s body]
SLEIPNIR: Died as he lived-- side by side with the bottle. [he picks up Fenrir’s bottle and throws it away while he eats an apple]
NARFI: So little respect for our brother.
SLEIPNIR: Well, at least he got a few licks in before the shivving.
NARFI: [touches a finger to blood spatter on the ground and tastes it] This is archangel blood.
SLEIPNIR: Better call father.

[exterior, the Apocalypse World, a flyover of the original location with the giant angel blades from 12.23, zooming into the church where Mary and Jack had once been held prisoner, but now seems abandoned. Jack opens his eyes. The flyover was his vision or dream, and they’re sitting around a fire in their camp, with a group of rebels]
JACK: It's all empty.
MARY: You're sure?
JACK: There are a few angels guarding the perimeter, but inside… they're gone.
MARY: What is going on?
JACK: Maybe...maybe he's scared.
JAKOB: We've been fighting Michael the better part of eight years. There is nothing he is scared of.
JACK: He's scared of me. I'm winning.
MARY: Jack--
JACK: I think we should go, see if Michael left anything behind, something that can tell us where he's gone, what he's planning.
MARY: It could be a trap.
JACK: It's all right. I'll keep you safe.

[interior, the motel room where Gabriel is still passed out on the sofa]
SAM: Until his grace levels come back up, I-I just… I don't get it.
DEAN: Yeah, well, right now, don't care. He's here, and we're gonna keep him here.
GABRIEL: [suddenly waking up and bolting upright] Where?! Where am I? [he sees Sam and Dean and remembers] Oh, right. You.
SAM: Gabriel, look, we don't really know what's going on here--
DEAN: We need your help.
GABRIEL: Uh… yeah, not a big joiner.
DEAN: Oh, so you got better things to do than save the world?
GABRIEL: Exactly. [he inhales sharply and struggles to stand again] Look, this has been… great, a real thrill. But, uh, I just came here for the silver stuff. And since you two are all fresh out, it's time for me to say sayonara.
[as Gabriel is gathering his things and making for the door, it slams open revealing Sleipnir and Narfi]
GABRIEL: Raspberries.

ACT II

[interior, the motel room, Narfi enters, followed by Sleipnir]
NARFI: We're here for the angel. [Narfi’s face glows with an overlaid skull, and Sleipner’s glows with a horse’s head]
DEAN: The here are you guys? [to Gabriel] The here are these guys?
GABRIEL: Oh, just a couple of Norse demigods.
SAM: Demigods?!
[Narfi attacks Sam, and the fight begins. Sleipnir attacks Dean, while Gabriel hides in the closet]
DEAN: Gabriel, little help in here!
[Gabriel cowers, shaking his head as Narfi chokes Sam and Sleipnir backs Dean against a wall with a whip]
DEAN: Sammy!
[Dean finally knocks Sleipnir down, and goes to Sam’s aid, but Gabriel has beaten him to it, stabbing Narfi in the back with another wooden sword. Sleipnir watches as Narfi dies, and then Gabriel holds up the sword toward Sleipnir]
GABRIEL: Hiya, handsome. You ready to die?
[apparently not ready to die, Sleipnir runs away. Gabriel hunches over in pain after straining his injury]
GABRIEL: Ooh.
DEAN: You okay?
GABRIEL: Uh, yeah. I'll go after him in a sec. I just...need a minute.
DEAN: Wrong. [Dean holds up a pair of angel handcuffs] You're not goin' anywhere.

[interior, the Apocalypse World, inside Michael’s abandoned church as the rebels enter and search it]
MAN: Clear over here. All clear.
MARY: Jakob, take the others. Check the warding. [A group of her soldiers go out to secure the perimeter and Mary sighs] Really hate this place.
JACK: Look.
[he points to the altar, set up like a war table with a map and plastic army men converging on one point]
MARY: Well, those are Michael's armies.
JACK: Why are they all over there?
MARY: I don't know.
[the other men return dragging Kevin Tran between them]
JAKOB: Look who we found in the dungeon. The prophet. Kevin Tran. [they angrily push Kevin to his knees] He's a traitor!
KEVIN: I'm-- I'm a prophet of the lord. I was serving God--
JAKOB: You serve Michael. Prophet here turned his back on own kind.
KEVIN: I didn't have a choice! I… Y-you don't understand. I… I… I never used to believe in anything. Well, ex-except science-- quantum mechanical unpredictably. But then the end of the world happened, and everyone around me-- my friends, and my… my mom-- they all started to die. But God chose me? What… What does that even mean?! Michael said he wanted to save the world, not kill it. But he… he hurt so many people. When I couldn't perfect the spell, Michael, he got mad and threw me in the dungeon. And I was so scared, but I fixed it. B-but I… I couldn't do it anymore.
MARY: Kevin...
KEVIN: And then he...he...
MARY: What spell? What's Michael planning?
KEVIN: There's a place in the south where the walls between worlds are thin. Michael's gonna use a spell from the angel tablet to open up the rift, and then he's g--
JACK: He'll invade our world.

[interior, the motel room, where Gabriel is handcuffed to the room divider, as Sam and Dean return and remove their jackets]
GABRIEL: You know… you guys are lucky I'm low on juice, considering what I did to the last guy who locked me up.
SAM: You know what? We said we'd let you go, just as soon as you tell us what the here is going on here.
GABRIEL: Yeah, it, uh… it's not a fun story.
DEAN: Well, we just broke into a junkyard and stuffed the body of a demigod into a car crusher, so I think you owe us some answers.
GABRIEL: Okay, they're not really demigods.
DEAN: Mm.
GABRIEL: Look, the Norse pantheon is its own weird thing. Think of 'em more like, uh, god-begotten monsters.
DEAN: Whatever. What did they want with you?
GABRIEL: I killed their brother.
SAM: Why?
GABRIEL: Remember when I told you what happened after I faked my death at the Elysian Motel?
SAM: Yeah, of course. You went to, uh, Monte Carlo with a bunch of porn stars.
DEAN: Uh-huh.
GABRIEL: Yeah… well, I left a few parts out. [Gabriel relates the tale in voiceover as he’s escorted into a fancy hotel suite by Fenrir and Narfi] After Lucifer, quotation marks, killed me, I needed to lay low. Luckily, I used to hang with a pretty resourceful crew. Found me a real top-shelf hideaway.
[Gabriel, in a tux with the tie undone, joins Sleipnir, Narfi, and Fenrir playing poker in the suite]
I'm calling it.
I'm calling, all right?
Ohh.
SLEIPNIR: Aw, come on!
FENRIR: Skol.
GABRIEL: Gentlemen...
No! What?!
Oh, no!
Come on.
[Gabriel wins the hand, and everyone is impressed and laughing, and they toast, before Dean interrupts Gabriel’s flashback]
DEAN: I thought this story had porn stars.
GABRIEL: Ah! Good catch. My bad.
[the scene in the hotel suite rewinds at high speed, and Gabriel joins the poker game again, except this time smooth sax music is playing and the suite is filled with porn stars. The action of the game is the same, but the tone is entirely different, with Gabriel playing it up for the woman in his lap]
Mmm.
I'm-- I'm calling, all right?
Ohh.
Aw, come on!
Skol.
GABRIEL: Gentlemen...
Ooh!
You're kidding me!
Oh, ho!
I knew it!
GABRIEL: Hey, come on.
[later in the same suite, Gabriel is in a robe with two scantily clad women]
GABRIEL: I had it made-- all the booze I could drink, all the, uh, entertainment I could handle.
[Sam interrupts and Dean looks disappointed, but the action returns to the motel room]
SAM: Okay! Why don't we just skip to the end?
[Gabriel sighs and skips to the end of the story, asleep in bed with the two women, when Sleipnir, Narfi, and Fenrir bound him with a sigil and kidnapped him from his bed]
GABRIEL: So this is how it ended. By the time I came to, they had sold me to Asmodeus.
SAM: Why would they do that?
GABRIEL: Hello? Lucifer? In case you don't remember, there was an apocalypse brewing at the time.
SAM: We remember.
GABRIEL: Well, Vegas odds had my bro pulling off a big win.
DEAN: Yeah? And whose fault was that?
GABRIEL: Mm. Fenrir, Sleipnir, and Narfi were just trying to cover their keisters. They needed to get rid of me before Lucifer figured out where they had me hidden. But selling me to that Kentucky Fried B-hole? For them? That was all profit.
DEAN: So you want revenge.
GABRIEL: Well, obviously. Roasting Asmodeus was, uh, satisfying for a hot minute. But you know one thing better than killing him? Slaughtering them all.
SAM: But since you're low on grace, you had to do it the old-fashioned way-- with wood.
GABRIEL: Don't let anybody ever tell you you're just a pretty face.
[Dean frowns and shakes his head at that]
SAM: All right, anyway, if there are only, uh, three gods or monsters or whatever, how come there are four swords?
GABRIEL: Oh. That top one? That is for the man with the plan, the architect of my torture, and my own personal public enemy numero uno. Their papa… Loki.

[interior, Michael’s abandoned church in the Apocalypse World, gathered around the map table]
MAN: Jakob's right. Leaving his plans like this? It's too sloppy.
SECOND MAN: Or he doesn't care.
MAN: Doesn't care?
SECOND MAN: He knows we can't stop him. He's probably making his move as we speak.
JACK: No, I can go, right now. If I can surprise Michael, I can kill him.
MARY: Jack, no.
JACK: No, we can't let him cross over.
MARY: I know, but--
JACK: We know where he is.
MARY: Do we? Michael could've left this map as bait. Bobby's only a day out. We should wait.
KEVIN: Mary's right. Michael, he… never does anything without a reason.
JAKOB: I say we let the archangel go. Let Michael be some other world's problem for a change.
MARY: How can you even say that? That's 7 billion innocent people. [she scoffs and turns to Jack] Jack, listen to me. This is Michael we're talking about. He's killed everyone that's ever stood against him. We have to think this through. I'm asking for a day. Please.

[interior, motel room, Dean drinks from a flask]
DEAN: Hold on. I thought Loki was you.
GABRIEL: It's trippy, I know. Look, remember when I told you I went into witness protection? Well, who do you think put me there?
SAM: Loki? [Gabriel nods] You and Loki are friends?
GABRIEL: Oh, well… We were. A few thousand epochs ago, I was out for a hike in the fjords. Came across Loki bound in a cave, snake dripping venom into his eye. Ugh. Apparently, he had some spat with his pops. Anyhoo, I freed him. Saved his life. Then my real brothers started going at it. I wanted out. Loki owed me one, so… he helped me ditch Gabriel and become him.
DEAN: So then you took on his whole… trickster vibe.
SAM: What did Loki do while you were impersonating him?
GABRIEL: Oh. Well, he had his own family drama to worry about. It was in his best interest to go off the grid for a while.
DEAN: But you saw him in Monte Carlo.
GABRIEL: Well, I needed someplace to hide. He'd already helped me the once.
DEAN: You know, none of this would've happened if you'd had just… stuck around and helped us fight Lucifer.
GABRIEL: Hey, I did help you. “Casa Erotica”?
SAM: You call that help?
GABRIEL: I call that art. But yes, without me, you two chuckleheads never would've known how to throw Lucifer back in the Cage.
DEAN: But instead of giving us a hand, you ran. And you just did it again when you ditched us in the bunker.
GABRIEL: All right, Dean-- I have more important things to do than to join your little band of merry men.
DEAN: Hey, what you're doing? This? This is not important.
GABRIEL: Every day, Asmodeus tortured me. Every… day! He fed off my grace for years! He used me, he debased me until I was… What I went through… you don't forgive. Everyone who had a hand in it will die. Get me?
SAM: Yeah. We do.
DEAN: Okay, you went through it. We get it. All right? But killing Loki? Not gonna change any of that. It's not. In fact, probably not even gonna make you feel better.
GABRIEL: Well, agree to disagree, Dean-o. We all have our demons. Mine are here, in this town.
SAM: Okay. But...you're low on grace. And Loki knows you're coming.
DEAN: Sam.
[Dean leads Sam out into the hall for a private conference]
SAM: What?
DEAN: Not like I care about killing gods, okay? But this whole revenge kick? It's a waste of time.
SAM: What if it's not?
DEAN: You've seen it, Sam-- with me, with Dad. Revenge only ends one way-- ugly.
SAM: Well, maybe it doesn't have to.
DEAN: Okay, I think I know what this is.
SAM: Okay, what is this?
DEAN: You. You're you're so hopped up on this “Kill Bill” fantasy of his.
SAM: No, no, no. This has nothing to do with me.
DEAN: If you had a shot at Lucifer, you wouldn't take it?
SAM: Of course I would. But this is about Gabriel. He needs our help.
[Dean rolls his eyes, but agrees to hear out Sam’s plan back in the room]
SAM: Gabriel, you agree to help us, we'll agree to help you.
GABRIEL: Hmm.

ACT III
[interior, the map table in the abandoned church in the Apocalypse World. Lightning flashes and thunder sounds as Jack stands over the table, contemplating his options]

[interior, the motel room. Sam loads a gun while Gabriel changes clothes and Dean packs up their weapons bag]
DEAN: All right, Uma, what's the plan?
GABRIEL: Well, Sleipnir's a lot of things, but mainly, he is a coward. I will bet all the personal lubricant in the S.F.V… that after we killed Narfi, he ran straight back to papa's skirts.
SAM: So he and Loki will be together. That's great. How do we find them?
GABRIEL: Uh, they're about a… 5-minute drive from here. Penthouse of the Ophidian Hotel.
SAM: Seriously?
DEAN: You've known this whole time?
GABRIEL: Sure. That's what Loki does. He rolls into a dump town, finds the seediest motel, then uses some mojo to give it his patented Cinderella treatment. [we see Loki work his mojo, as classical guitar music plays and he transforms the seedy motel room into a luxury suite] Loki has his fun, then he moves on. I've been tracking him since Amarillo.
DEAN: And you didn't go after him. Why?
GABRIEL: 'Cause that's… ah… For the most satisfying retributive experience, everyone knows you don't take on the Big Bad from the jump. You work up to him, like so.
[Gabriel shows Dean his kill list, with Fenrir and Narfi’s names crossed out]
DEAN: What am I lookin' at?
GABRIEL: You-- you've never seen a kill list before? Wow. Hmm. Okay. There's Fenrir, Narfi, Sleipnir, and then last but not least, Loki. I'm killing all of his sons in order. And then, when he's got nothing left, I take him out.
DEAN: This is so stupid.
GABRIEL: Really? Is it? 'Cause let me tell you something. Seven years is a long-ass time for me to plan my own personal brand of vengeance. So if you guys aren't gonna get onboard...
SAM: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're 'rboard. Right, Dean?
[Dean shrugs and grunts]
GABRIEL: I'm sorry. What was that?
DEAN: Sure.
GABRIEL: Peachy. So here's what we're gonna do. We go in, we kill Sleipnir, and then, we surprise Big Daddy in the penthouse. Easy peasy like a breeze-y.

[interior, the AU church]
JACK: I know I said I'd wait, but...
MARY: You're going after Michael.
JACK: I have to.
MARY: You can't.
JACK: You don't think I can win.
MARY: I think we don't know how strong Michael is.
JACK: And he doesn't know how strong I am.
MARY: I know you've been winning all these fights, and you want to take him on so bad. I was just like you, with hunting. But I learned the hard way-- thinking you can win all the time, running in blind into every fight? That's how you make mistakes. And the people here, they--
JACK: I'm doing this for them.
MARY: You can't help them if you're dead. And I can't lose another boy.
[Jack reaches out and lays a hand on Mary’s shoulder]
JACK: You won't. I'll come back, for all of you. I promise.
KEVIN: No.
MARY: Kevin?
KEVIN: You can't go.
[Kevin tears open his shirt revealing a sigil carved into his chest. Everyone in the room other than Mary and Jack aims guns at him, but Mary pushes one man’s gun down] Michael… he told me to wait-- for Bobby, for all of you to be together-- but I can't. He wanted you to see.
MARY: Whatever Michael said, he was lying.
KEVIN: No! Michael says… that when I get to Heaven-- when he lets me into Heaven-- I'll get to see my mom again.
MARY: I've been to Heaven, and what's there… it's just memories. Nothing's real.
KEVIN: I don't care! You don't understand. I… You don't know the things that I've done. I just want this to be over.
JACK: Your spell won't kill me.
KEVIN: Michael doesn't want to kill you. He wants to break you. He said for me to tell you that, “Even if you win, you still lose.” I'm sorry.
MARY: Don't!
[Kevin activates the sigil, and the room fills with blinding light. Jack grabs Mary and wraps his wings around her, protecting her]
KEVIN: I'm sorry!

ACT IV

[interior, lobby of the Ophidian hotel. Sleipnir walks in flanked by two bodyguards, munching a carrot, and rides up in the elevator to the penthouse. Gabriel, flanked by Sam and Dean follow them as soon as the elevator doors close, and then follow them up as the dramatic showdown music is replaced with elevator muzak as they strategize on the elevator ride]
GABRIEL: One last thing, just so we're clear. Take out the bodyguards, take out the bystanders, whatever. But when it comes to Sleipnir and Loki, I’m the one who delivers the coup de grace. I want my beautiful face to be the last thing that they see.
DEAN: Okay, no, you know what? No more plans, no more rules. You want Loki dead on the ground? That's what you're gonna get.
[the elevator doors open, and Sleipnir and his guards stand at the opposite end of the hall.]
SLEPINIR: Get him!
[his guards rush into action, but Gabriel snaps his fingers and the lights go out. A gunfight erupts, and Gabriel gets out Sleipnir’s sword by the strobing light of muzzle flashes as Sam and Dean dispatch his guards. When he snaps his fingers again and the lights come back on, Sleipnir is on the ground at the point of Gabriel’s sword, begging for his life.]
SLEIPNIR: Please.
[but Gabriel stabs him, while Sam notices that Dean’s nowhere to be found]
SAM: Dean? Dean! He left.
GABRIEL: Ah. Big bros, right? Always think they know best.
SAM: The penthouse. He went after Loki!
GABRIEL: No. No, Loki's mine!
[Sam and Gabriel rush after Dean, but he’s already arriving at the penthouse, armed with the wooden sword, as flamenco music plays. He pushes open the door to find Loki in the lavish suite holding a lollipop that he returns to a lollipop humidor]
DEAN: Loki?
LOKI: So you are Dean Winchester.
DEAN: And you're the annoying god that we're wasting our time tryin' to kill.
LOKI: Mm. And did Gabriel tell you why he wants me dead?
DEAN: I don't care.
LOKI: Yes, you do. Little bit. Our treatment of your friend is payback for a slight of a more personal nature. The death of my father, Odin.
DEAN: Oh, that wasn't him. Lucifer did that.
LOKI: Ah. But why was my father there in the first place? To parlay, to deal with Gabriel's brothers. When we first made terms, I had only one condition-- I would give him my face, teach him to be me, the trickster, if he agreed to abandon the more… volatile affairs of his family. Forever. When he hit that hotel, he broke that promise, and it cost my father his life.
DEAN: The world was coming to an end.
LOKI: That never mattered to him before. Gabriel had to be punished. Odin was a salty, disagreeable bastard. Truth is… he despised me. But he was my father. I'm sure you understand. What would you do for your father?
[Dean stabs Loki with the sword, but he’s just a hologram. Meanwhile out in the hall, the real Loki confronts Gabriel]
LOKI: Hello, Gabriel.
[in the suite, Dean pulls the sword out of the hologram Loki, who then knocks Dean across the room. Dean tries to slice him with the sword again, and hologram!Loki just sighs]
DEAN: Oh, so you can hit me, but I can't hit you?
LOKI: Mess with the real Trickster… [he gut punches Dean] get the real tricks. [he knocks Dean to the ground. Sam runs in, sees Loki, and aims his gun and fires]
DEAN: No, no, no! It's Loki magic. He's a hologram.
SAM: All right, if we can't kill him, we gotta kill the real Loki.
[back in the hallway, Loki and Gabriel face off]
LOKI: You don't have my wooden sword?
GABRIEL: No. [Gabriel tosses down Sleipnir’s sword] Wanted to do this one old school.
LOKI: Mm. With your… “archangel” powers? This is for my father. [Loki uses his mojo to throw Gabriel into the wall]
GABRIEL: Ah!
LOKI: You think you're some… poor, innocent victim? [he strolls over and punches Gabriel again] Gabriel, with his deadbeat daddy and his mean older brothers. [he stomps on Gabriel] “Who will help me?” “Who will save me?” [he picks Gabriel up and pins him to the wall by his neck] I did! But you… you couldn't keep one promise. And then you had the audacity to ask me to help you again?! [he throws Gabriel down the hall, where Sam and Dean have arrived in a doorway behind him] You think I deserve to die for your spinelessness?! That my sons deserved to die?!
[the fight continues, as Dean slides Loki’s sword to Gabriel and Gabriel finally gets Loki pinned to the wall at the tip of the blade]
LOKI: Of course, of course you would need someone to swoop in and save your pitiful ass.
GABRIEL: Shut up!
LOKI: Face it, old friend, you're a joke. You're a failure. You live for pleasure. You stand for nothing. And in the end, that's exactly what you'll die for.
GABRIEL: You first.
[Gabriel stabs him, and then nods to Sam and Dean as his vengeance is complete]

ACT V

[interior, the AU church, where Jack kneels on the floor holding an unconscious Mary across his lap in a reverse Pieta, thunder booming and lightning flashing through cross-shaped windows as we see the bodies of their friends around the room]

[Exterior, the Ophidian hotel as Sam puts Gabriel’s sword case into the trunk of the Impala]
GABRIEL: Listen… I know you two weren't the, uh, eagerest of beavers when it came to helping me out back there, so, uh… I-I just wanna say… thanks. So… this other world Michael… how we doing this?
SAM: Wait, you're… actually gonna help us?
DEAN: Yeah, no tricks?
GABRIEL: A deal is a deal. And if I'm being perfectly honest, tricks are for kids.
SAM: Hey… How you feeling? Now that… you…
GABRIEL: Got my sweet, sweet vengeance on?
SAM: Yeah, sure. I guess.
GABRIEL: Swell, Sam. I'm a whole new guy.
SAM: That's what I thought.

[interior, the abandoned AU church]
JACK: It's my fault. I said I'd protect them.
MARY: We can prepare and we can fight… and sometimes, things happen we'll never see coming.
JACK: If I can't keep them safe, then what's the point?

[interior, the war room at the bunker, Dean’s sitting at the map table drinking a glass of whiskey when Sam walks in]
SAM: All right, so Cas is helping Gabriel settle in. Rowena's boning up on the demon tablet. So… once Gabe's grace levels are back up, we-- we should be good to go.
DEAN: Great.
SAM: Yeah. Yeah.
DEAN: Mmm.
SAM: Hey… back at the hotel… why did you go after Loki without us?
DEAN: Saw an opening, so I took it.
SAM: So you left us?
DEAN: You guys were handling those goons just fine. I just figured I'd… multitask.
SAM: That's not… I'm saying this has become a whole thing with you lately.
DEAN: A whole thing?
SAM: Yeah.
DEAN: Since when?
SAM: Since the last time we opened up a rift. Since you decided to sideline me and then head to Apocalypse World with Ketch.
DEAN: Okay, well… we talked about that.
SAM: Did we? Because I gotta be honest, after everything, you're treating me like I-I deserve to be back at the kid's table or something.
DEAN: Sam, I'm not gonna apologize for protecting you.
SAM: So that's what you think you're doing here?
DEAN: You remember what happened the last time we had front row tickets to the Lucifer/Michael show? 'Cause I do. You died… and went to Hell. But see, this time, the apocalypse isn't looking for us. We're actually looking for it. I don't care what happens to me. I never really have. But I do care about what happens to my brother.
SAM: Dean, we're going to that place, and we're gonna save Jack and Mom. Together. And if something happens, we will deal with it together. And if we die? We'll do that together, too.
