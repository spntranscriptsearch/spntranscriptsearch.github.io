EXT. PRISON - DAY


INT. PRISON - DAY

KUBRICK is being swiped down with a metal detector, before he enters the prison visitors area. He sits down on the other side of a window in front of GORDON WALKER and picks up the two-way phone.

KUBRIK It's true. A Devil's Gate was opened in Wyoming. Big. St Helen's big.

KUBRIK There's no solid fix on how many demons got out, but it's in the hundreds. An army.

GORDON Sam Winchester was there. Wasn't he?

KUBRIK Talked to a guy who knows a guy who knows Bobby Singer, and yeah, it looks like the Winchesters were at ground zero when the gate was popped, but Singer said they went in there to stop it.

GORDON Mhn-mhn (shaking his head no). Bobby's edge ain't what it used to be. Sam could have him believing anything by now.

KUBRIK Listen Gordon, as far as talk goes? Sam Winchester checks out. He's a hunter, that's all.

GORDON That's all?

KUBRICK nods.

GORDON (Laughs) Kubrick, I'm not even sure he's human.

KUBRICK laughs nervously.

GORDON You think I'm crazy? I told you there was a war coming – six months ago. Take a look around. It's here. Now I'm telling you this boy is a part of it. Track him down, Kubrick. You'll come to see it too. Sam Winchester must die.

GORDON hangs up the phone.


END OF TEASER

ACT ONE
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The Impala is traveling along a quiet, dark road. SAM and DEAN are arguing.


INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

DEAN Because Demon, that's why. I mean the second you find out this Ruby chick is a Demon you go for the holy water! You don't chat!

SAM No one was chatting, Dean.

DEAN Oh yeah? Then why didn't you send her ass back to Hell?

SAM Because - Because she said she might be able to help us out!

DEAN How?

SAM pauses.

DEAN No really, Sam, how? How could she possibly help us?

SAM She told me she could help you, OK?

DEAN is not getting it.

SAM Help you out of the crossroads deal.

DEAN looks at SAM incredulously.

DEAN What is wrong with you, huh? She's lying, you gotta know that, don't you? She knows what your weakness is – it's me. (Pause) What else did she say?

SAM is silent.

DEAN Dude?

SAM Nothing. (Pause) Nothing, OK?! Look I'm not an idiot Dean, I'm not talking about trusting her, I'm talking about using her. I mean we're at war, right? And we don't know jack about the enemy; we don't know where they are, we don't know what they're doing. I mean, hell, we don't know what they want. Now this Ruby girl knows more than we will ever find out on our own. Now yes, it's a risk, I know that, but we need to take it.

DEAN You're okay right, I mean you're feeling okay?

SAM Yes I'm fine, Why are you always asking me that?

A phone starts ringing. SAM sighs and reaches for his own.

SAM It's not mine.

DEAN goes for his.

DEAN Nope. (Pause) Check the glove compartment, it's Dad's.

SAM Dad's?

DEAN Yes, I keep it charged up in case any of his old contacts call.

SAM opens the glove compartment, finds JOHN'S phone and answers it.

SAM Hello? Yes... this is Edgar Casey...

No! No, no, no, don't – don't call the police, I'll handle this myself. Thanks. You know, can you just uh, can you just lock it back up for me? Great. Uhm, I- I uh, I don't have my - my book in front of me, (gestures to DEAN for a pen) do you- do you have the address so I can... Sure, OK. Go ahead. Right, thanks a lot.

SAM ends the call.

SAM Dad ever tell you he kept a container at a storage place?

DEAN What?

SAM Outside of Buffalo?

DEAN No way.

SAM Yeah. And someone just broke into it.


TITLE
"BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK"


EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

EXT. KUBRICK'S RV AND CREEDY'S PICKUP - DAY

INT. RV - DAY

KUBRICK and fellow Hunter CREEDY are cleaning and checking weapons inside the RV.

CREEDY So you got no hard evidence on this Winchester guy. You're just working off Gordon's instincts?

KUBRIK You ever hunt with Gordon?

CREEDY No. I heard he's good.

KUBRIK Good? (Laughs) He's the best, saved my ass more times than I can count. So if he says Sam Winchester's dangerous, I believe him.

CREEDY He's gonna be covering his tracks. Won't be easy to find.

KUBRIK Last I got puts him in Nebraska three weeks back.

CREEDY Not exactly a fresh lead.

KUBRIK He ain't invisible, Creedy. Some Hunter out there knows something. So we start calling out contacts. All we need is one break.

KUBRICK gets up from the table and looks over at CREEDY, who has taken some kind of plastic 3D Jesus out of an overhead cupboard and is fiddling with it. There's a black velvet Jesus, in a frame, hanging opposite.

KUBRIK Don't play with my Jesus.


EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

INT. STORAGE FACILITY ELEVATOR

DEAN Man...

SAM What?

DEAN Just Dad. You know him and his secrets. Spend all this time with the guy and it's like we barely even know the man.

SAM Well, we're about to learn something.

SAM and DEAN exit the elevator and find the storage container. DEAN unlocks the padlock and opens the sliding door, both brothers with flashlights at the ready. On the dusty floor of the container is a symbol drawn in red, along with several bloody footprints.


INT. STORAGE CONTAINER

SAM No demons allowed.

DEAN Blood. Check this out.

DEAN holds up a tripwire which is attached to a shotgun hidden in a large animal skull.

SAM Whoever broke in here got tagged.

DEAN Dear old Dad. I got two sets of boot treads here, looks like it was a two-man job. And our friend with the buckshot in him looks like he kept walking.

SAM So what's the deal? Dad would do work here or something?

DEAN Living the high life, as usual.

SAM and DEAN venture further inside. DEAN aims his flashlight on the skull and shakes his head, laughing. SAM looks over a desk while DEAN picks up a trophy from a shelf, scraping the dust off.

DEAN (reading) 1995

SAM No way! That's my Division Championship soccer trophy. I can't believe he kept this.

DEAN Yeah... It was probably about the closest you ever came to being a boy. (DEAN wanders over to another find.) Oh, wow! It's my first sawed-off. I made it myself. Sixth grade.

DEAN laughs and pumps the shotgun.

SAM moves further into the container and opens a door to a back room. The chain on the door has been cut. SAM and DEAN enter and pass their flashlights over the scene.

DEAN Holy crap. Look at this, he had land mines... Which they didn't take. Or the guns. I guess they knew what they were after, huh?

SAM spots boxes inscribed with symbols on a far shelf.

SAM Hey Dean, check this out. See these symbols? That's binding magic. These are curse boxes.

DEAN Curse boxes? Th – they're supposed to keep the evil mojo in, right, kinda like the Pandora deal?

SAM Yeah. Yeah, they're built to contain the power of the cursed object.

DEAN Well Dad's journal did mention a whole bunch of stuff, you know? Dangerous hexed items, fetishes ... He never did say where they ended up.

SAM Yeah. Well this must be his toxic waste dump. (SAM notices a rectangular shape in the dust and runs his finger along the dust.) One box is missing... Great.

DEAN Well maybe they didn't open it.




INT. WAYNE AND GROSSMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY


GROSSMAN Come on man, let's open it.

WAYNE (yelling) Shut up about the damn box!

Inside the apartment of petty thieves WAYNE and GROSSMAN, WAYNE is sitting on the couch, his left shoulder bleeding from a gunshot wound. The missing curse box is on a coffee table.

WAYNE Do you see what's happening here? I am literally! bleeding! to death!

GROSSMAN Uh, I'm gonna open it.

WAYNE Grossman!

GROSSMAN Look what if this is really worth something? What, we should just hand it over to her? Hey, we took all the risk. Hell, Wayne. You got shot. And all for a lousy few hundred bucks. Now we could make more, selling whatever it is ourselves.

GROSSMAN breaks open the lock on the box with a knife and lifts the lid. WAYNE gets up from the couch to see what's inside.

GROSSMAN Huh?

WAYNE Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?!

WAYNE picks up the object in the box.

WAYNE It's a rabbit's foot- It's a rabbit's foot, Grossman! I'm gonna die for a damn rabbit's foot.

WAYNE and GROSSMAN are interrupted by banging on the front door.

WAYNE Oh great, now what?

WAYNE slams the rabbit's foot down on the table while GROSSMAN answers the door.

GROSSMAN Oh, hey Foster.

FOSTER Hey, listen guys, not to be a drag or nothing but it's six o'clock in the morning!

GROSSMAN Right.

FOSTER Can't you keep it down?!

GROSSMAN No we... Just got a situation here is all, sorry.

FOSTER (to WAYNE) What the hell happened to you?

WAYNE Shotgun happened to me.

FOSTER walks over to WAYNE before turning back to GROSSMAN.

FOSTER Hey Grossman? Under my sink there's a medical kit. And get some water boiling.

GROSSMAN OK.

GROSSMAN leaves and FOSTER checks WAYNE'S wound.

FOSTER I used to be an Army Medic you know, in 'Nam? So I guess this is your lucky day. (Laughs)



EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

SAM and DEAN pull up in the alley beside the apartment block, next to another car. DEAN leans out and checks the car's plates.

DEAN Connecticut. Last three digits 880.

SAM Yep, that's it.

DEAN (Clucks) Should've blacked out their plates before they parked in front of the security camera...



INT. WAYNE AND GROSSMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

WAYNE and GROSSMAN are playing Poker.

WAYNE Four Kings.

GROSSMAN (Groans) Unbelievable.

WAYNE You see that? (Laughs)

GROSSMAN Yeah, yeah, yeah.

WAYNE Deal 'em up again.

SAM and DEAN break into the apartment, armed, and sneak inside.

WAYNE Royal Flush. Grossman, that's the second Royal Flush in eight hands.

GROSSMAN Yeah, this is a lot of fun.

WAYNE I can't lose. I mean really, I - I can't lose!

WAYNE grabs the rabbit's foot.

WAYNE Maybe this thing really works? You know what I'm saying? Ah – I tell you something there's no way in Hell we are handing it over to that stuck-up bitch now, not after all we've been through. Uh uh. Let's go, huh? Let's get out of here, let's go have some fun.

DEAN and SAM burst into the room, guns drawn.

DEAN FREEZE, FREEZE! NOBODY MOVE!

SAM Don't move!

DEAN DON'T MOVE!

WAYNE What is this?

SAM STOP!

DEAN All right, give us the box. And please tell me that you didn't–

SAM Oh they did.

DEAN You opened it?!

DEAN shoves WAYNE against the wall.

WAYNE Are you guys cops?

DEAN Huh?

WAYNE ARE YOU GUYS COPS?!

DEAN What was in the box?

WAYNE glances over at the coffee table where the rabbit's foot sits. DEAN follows his gaze.

DEAN Oh, was that is, huh? It was wasn't it? What is that thing?

WAYNE uses DEAN'S distraction to knock the gun from DEAN'S hand. It falls to the floor, causing it to fire. The bullet ricochets off a radiator and hits SAM'S gun, causing him to drop it. The same bullet then ricochets again and breaks a lamp. SAM and GROSSMAN both go for SAM'S gun. GROSSMAN pushes SAM into DEAN. DEAN falls back on the coffee table, launching the rabbit's foot into the air.

SAM (to DEAN) Sorry!

GROSSMAN throws himself at SAM, sending them both to the floor, and then starts punching SAM in the face. WAYNE goes for DEAN'S gun. As he picks it up and aims for SAM, he hits DEAN, who has just gotten up, square under the chin, knocking him down again. GROSSMAN is now trying to strangle SAM. SAM desperately tries to reach for the rabbit's foot, which is almost out of reach. SAM just manages to grab it, then knocks GROSSMAN'S hands away from his throat and kicks him back into a corner. SAM gets up.

SAM DEAN! I got it!

WAYNE moves forward and cocks DEAN'S gun in SAM'S face.

WAYNE No you don't.

GROSSMAN gets his hands on SAM'S gun while WAYNE pulls the trigger on SAM. The gun jams. WAYNE panics and tries to clear the chamber, while DEAN gets up and tries to stop him. WAYNE is surprised and stumbles back, tripping over a rug and falling back over the couch. He knocks himself out. SAM and DEAN look at each other, confused. GROSSMAN gets up and tries to point the gun at SAM.

DEAN SAM!

As GROSSMAN moves, the books on the bookshelves behind him suddenly fall off and onto his head, knocking him out cold. SAM'S gun flies out of his hand and SAM catches it. DEAN looks astounded.

DEAN That was a lucky break! (pause) Is that a rabbit's foot?!

SAM holds it up.

SAM I think it is.

DEAN Huh.



EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

Dean walks over to the Impala with a paper bag in his hands. He gets in. Sam is inside. DEAN takes something out of the bag.

SAM I'm not finding anything on it in Dad's journal.

DEAN holds up several scratch cards in front of SAM.

SAM Dean, come on.

DEAN What?! Hey, that was my gun he was aiming at your head, and my gun don't jam. So that was a lucky break. Not to mention them taking themselves out, also a lucky break. Here, scratch one. C'mon Sam, scratch and win!

DEAN hands over a coin and a card. Sam scratches it.

SAM Dean, it's gotta be cursed somehow. Otherwise Dad wouldn't have locked it up.

SAM hands the card back.

DEAN $1200... You just won $1200! (Laughs and hollers) I don't know, man, it doesn't seem that cursed to me!

DEAN hands SAM another card expectantly.




INT. WAYNE AND GROSSMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

WAYNE and GROSSMAN are still laid out on the floor. WAYNE comes to and gets up, groaning.

WAYNE Grossman. Grossman, get up.

WAYNE kicks an empty beer bottle. It rolls into the kitchen.

WAYNE Hey, Grossman, get up. Hey!

WAYNE nudges GROSSMAN with his foot and walks into the kitchen. GROSSMAN is unresponsive. WAYNE steps over the beer bottle and heads to the sink, removing two plates, a colander and a large BBQ carving fork and placing them in the drainer. WAYNE turns on the tap and splashes water on his face and dries off with a dish cloth.

WAYNE Hey, Grossman. Grossman!

WAYNE goes to walk back out of the kitchen, his foot catching on the beer bottle in the middle of the floor. He trips and falls backwards, landing on the fork he placed in the drainer. GROSSMAN comes to, gets up and hears choking. GROSSMAN walks into the kitchen and sees WAYNE impaled on the fork, running from the back of his neck out through his mouth. He's gurgling and, presumably, dying. GROSSMAN screams.


END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

DEAN lays out 6 scratch cards on the hood of the Impala, calculating their winnings.

DEAN (Laughs) Oh, man!

SAM is on the phone to BOBBY.

SAM Now look Bobby, we didn't know.

BOBBY You touched it? Damn it, Sam!

SAM Well Dad never told us about this thing. I mean you knew about his storage place at Black Rock?



INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - DAY

BOBBY His lockup? Yeah, I knew. Hell I built those curse boxes for him.


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

BOBBY Listen, you have got a serious problem.

SAM notices something shining under a newspaper on the ground. It's a gold watch.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - DAY

BOBBY That rabbit's foot ain't no dime store notion.


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

SAM picks up the watch, turns and shows it to DEAN. DEAN mouths "awesome!"

BOBBY It's real Hoodoo, Old World stuff.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - DAY

BOBBY Made by a Baton Rouge conjure woman about a hundred years ago.


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

SAM It's a hell of a luck charm.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - DAY

BOBBY It's not a luck charm, it's a curse! She made it to kill people, Sam!


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

BOBBY See, you touch it, you own it. You own it, sure, you get a run of good luck to beat the Devil.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - DAY

BOBBY But, you lose it, that luck turns. It turns so bad that you're dead inside a week.


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

SAM Well, so I won't lose it, Bobby.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - DAY

BOBBY EVERYBODY LOSES IT!


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

SAM Well, then, how do we break the curse?


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - DAY

BOBBY (Sighs) I don't know if you can.


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

SAM places the rabbit's foot in his jacket pocket.

BOBBY Lemme look through my library and make some calls.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - DAY

BOBBY Just sit tight.

BOBBY ends the call. He appears to be working on the Colt.


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

DEAN Dude! We're up fifteen grand!

SAM gives a half-smile, looking worried.



INT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT - DAY

SAM and DEAN enter.

DEAN Don't worry, Bobby'll find a way to break it. Until then I say we hit Vegas, pull a little Rain Man. You can be Rain Man.

SAM Look, we just lay low until Bobby calls back, OK? (To RESTAURANT OWNER) Hi, uh, table for two please.

RESTAURANT OWNER CONGRATULATIONS!

An alarm goes off.

DEAN It's exciting, I know.

RESTAURANT OWNER You are the one millionth guest of the Biggerson's Restaurant family!

STAFF start singing and taking photographs. Balloons and streamers fall from the ceiling. SAM looks embarrassed while DEAN looks ecstatic.




EXT. KUBRICK'S RV AND CREEDY'S PICKUP - DAY

KUBRIK Right, you hear anything, give me a call.


INT. KUBRICK'S RV - DAY

KUBRIK Well that clears my book. The word's out. Now we wait.

CREEDY Now we eat.

KUBRIK Good idea. What do you like? I got canned everything.

CREEDY No, no, man, not eating in the RV. Look, I know a good place. Wide menu, good service, homey atmosphere. Garlic knots! The menu's on their website.

KUBRUCK doesn't look convinced.

(There's a Jesus fish on the window of KUBRICK's RV.)



INT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT - DAY

SAM is on his laptop. DEAN is eating a bowl of ice cream.

SAM Bobby's right. This lore goes way back. Pure Hoodoo. You can't just cut one off any rabbit. Has to be in a cemetery, under a full moon, on a Friday the thirteenth.

DEAN I think from now on, we only go to places with Biggerson's.

DEAN is struck with brain freeze from the ice cream. SAM laughs as a WAITRESS approaches their table with more coffee.

WAITRESS (to SAM) Can I freshen you up?

SAM Yeah, yeah sure. Thanks.

The WAITRESS pours SAM more coffee but, smiling at him, spills some.

WAITRESS Oh!

SAM Oh! Oh I uh-

WAITRESS Let me mop up here.

SAM No, no don't worry it's okay, It's okay- I got it, uh...

WAITRESS It's no trouble, really.

SAM OK.

WAITRESS Sorry about that.

SAM It's all right.

The WAITRESS appears to be flirting with SAM. SAM gives DEAN a look. The WAITRESS finishes cleaning up and walks away, looking over her shoulder as she goes and smiles. SAM and DEAN both lean in and watch her retreating.

DEAN Dude. If you were ever gonna get lucky...

SAM (Smirking) Shut up.

SAM goes to pick up his coffee, knocks the cup over and manages to spill it all over the table and himself. SAM jumps out of his seat.

SAM Oh! Oh Geez, uh...

SAM turns and a waiter with a full tray crashes straight into him, sending things flying and causing a scene. DEAN looks shocked.

SAM (to waiter) Sorry!

SAM turns back to DEAN.

DEAN How was that good?

SAM searches his jacket pocket and comes up empty. The rabbit's foot is gone.

DEAN Son of a bitch.


EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT

The waitress who was flirting with SAM is sauntering out in slow motion. She looks at the rabbit's foot in satisfaction, then pulls off her short black bob wig and tosses it in a dumpster, smiling, and letting her long brown hair flow out.



EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

SAM and DEAN rush out of the restaurant. DEAN Come on!

SAM falls flat on his face. DEAN slows down and turns around.

DEAN Wow! You suck!

DEAN reaches down and picks SAM up off the ground.

SAM Ow...

DEAN So what, now your luck turns bad?

SAM'S jeans are torn at both knees, which are bloody and raw.

SAM I guess.

DEAN I wonder how bad?


INT. KUBRICK'S RV - DAY

CREEDY passes his laptop to KUBRICK who looks over the screen.

KUBRIK Looks good. I like that when they drop the whole onion in the fryer.

CREEDY takes the laptop back.

CREEDY Nearest location...

CREEDY searches and then pauses, looking surprised. He passes the laptop back to KUBRICK.

CREEDY You seeing that?!

On the screen is a photograph of SAM and DEAN from their winning visit to the local Biggerson's. KUBRICK grins.

KUBRIK Yes I am.

KUBRICK looks up to the sky as though he's been given a sign.



INT. WAYNE AND GROSSMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

GROSSMAN is holding a photograph of himself and WAYNE. GROSSMAN holds up a bottle of Tequila and sadly toasts the memory of WAYNE. (He's listening to Mexican music. Vaya con dios... )

GROSSMAN Adios, compadre.

GROSSMAN pours a lug of Tequila on the floor, then takes a large swig. The door to the apartment opens and DEAN and SAM walk in. SAM hangs back.

GROSSMAN Oh, man. What do you want?

DEAN Heard about your friend. That's bad luck.

GROSSMAN Piss off.

DEAN We know someone hired you to steal the rabbit's foot. A woman.

GROSSMAN Oh yeah? How do you know that?

DEAN Because she just stole it back from us.

GROSSMAN laughs.

SAM Listen man, this is seri-

SAM steps forward and trips on a wire on the floor mid-sentence, pulling a CD player off a shelf and sending it and SAM crashing to the ground. SAM takes out a lamp as he goes. DEAN just rolls his eyes and doesn't look.

DEAN (calmly) Sam, you OK?

SAM (from the floor behind the couch) Yeah, I'm good!

SAM pulls himself up and GROSSMAN smirks.

DEAN (to GROSSMAN) I want you to tell us her name.

GROSSMAN Screw you.

DEAN It wasn't a freak accident that killed your partner.

GROSSMAN What?

DEAN It was the rabbit's foot.

GROSSMAN (scoffs incredulously) You're crazy, man.

DEAN You know I'm not. You saw what happened, what it did. All the flukes, all the luck. When you lose the foot that luck goes sour. That's what killed your friend. And my brother here is next. And who knows how many more innocent people after that. Now if you don't help us stop this thing, that puts those deaths on your head.

GROSSMAN looks worried.

DEAN Now I can read people ... and I get it. You're a thief, and a scumbag, that's fine. But you're not a killer. Are you?

GROSSMAN (Whispered) No.



EXT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

KUBRICK is leaning against his RV, which is festooned with bumper stickers: "HOW WOULD JESUS DRIVE?" "DON'T MAKE ME COME DOWN THERE. —GOD" and "Bethlehem or Bust".

CREEDY approaches from the restaurant.

CREEDY No one saw which way they went. And, their meal was free so there's no credit card trail.

KUBRIK Don't worry, we'll find 'em.

CREEDY What makes you so sure?

KUBRIK 'Cause there's a higher power at work here. I know it now.



EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN exit the apartment block. DEAN'S phone starts ringing. As DEAN answers, he steps over a large wad of pink bubblegum on the ground.

DEAN Hello?

SAM follows and there is a squishing sound. He gets a deeply frustrated look on his face as he lifts his shoe off of the bubblegum.

BOBBY Dean, great news. Wasn't easy but I found a heavyweight cleansing ritual that should do the trick.

DEAN Bobby, that's uh, great, 'cept Sam, uh...

DEAN looks over at SAM and grimaces when SAM lifts his shoe.

DEAN .. .Sam lost the foot.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - NIGHT

BOBBY He WHAT?


EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

DEAN Bobby, Bobby, listen. This, uh, this hot chick stole it from him. I'm serious. In her mid 20's, and she was sharp you know, good enough at the con to play us.

SAM is trying to scrape the bubblegum off his shoe using a broken storm drain grating.

DEAN And she only gave the guy she hired a name, probably an alias or something. (To SAM) Uh, Luigi or something?

SAM is still scraping his shoe off.

SAM Lugosi.

DEAN Lugosi.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - NIGHT

BOBBY Lugosi? Lugos - Aw crap, it's probably Bela.


EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

SAM moves his foot too hard, dislodging his shoe. It drops into the drain with a splash. He tries to retrieve it.

DEAN Bela Lugosi? That's cute.

BOBBY Bela Talbot's her real name.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - NIGHT

BOBBY Crossed paths with her once or twice.


EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

DEAN Well she knew about the rabbit's foot. Is she a Hunter?


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - NIGHT

BOBBY Pretty friggin' far from a Hunter, but she knows her way around the territory. She's been out of the country.


EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

BOBBY Last I heard she was in the Middle East someplace.

DEAN Ah, I guess she's back.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - NIGHT

BOBBY Which means seriously bad luck for you.


EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

DEAN Great.

BOBBY But, if it is Bela...


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - NIGHT

BOBBY At least I might know some folks who know where to find her.


EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

DEAN Thanks, Bobby. Again.


INT. BOBBY SINGER'S HOME - NIGHT

BOBBY Just ... look out for your brother, ya idjit.

BOBBY hangs up.



EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

DEAN looks back at SAM. SAM looks thoroughly dejected.

DEAN What?

SAM (plaintively) I lost my shoe.

DEAN looks down at SAM'S sock-clad foot and sighs, annoyed. He rolls his eyes and turns away. SAM hangs his head.


END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The Impala pulls into the lot and stops just inside the entrance.

DEAN (on the phone) All right, Bobby, thanks. Hey, we owe ya. Another one.

DEAN (to SAM) All right, Bobby's got it on pretty good authority that this Bela chick ... lives in Queens. So it'll take me about two hours to get there.

SAM So what are we doing here?

DEAN You, my brother, are staying here 'cause I don't want your bad luck getting us killed.

DEAN drives the Impala into the main lot, passing KUBRICK'S RV on the way.


INT. MOTEL ROOM 2 - NIGHT

DEAN unlocks the door and leads SAM inside, turning on a light as he goes.

SAM What am I even supposed to do, Dean?

DEAN Nothing! Nothing. Come here. I don't want you doing anything. I want you to sit right here (DEAN pulls a chair into the middle of the room), and don't move, OK? Don't turn on the light, don't turn off the light. Don't even scratch your nose.

SAM sits in the chair and watched DEAN leave, locking the door behind him. SAM wrinkles his nose a few times before risking a scratch.



EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER - EARLY MORNING

SUBTITLE QUEENS, NEW YORK


INT. BELA'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

BELA'S apartment is richly decorated and contains varied valuable artifacts. BELA is on the phone. She walks down stairs and into the kitchen. She talks with an affected British accent.

BELA Because you shook on one point five. Well maybe I should just take it somewhere else?

BELA pets a Seal Point Siamese cat that is sitting on the counter.

BELA Don't threaten me, Luke. Despite your reputation you don't scare me. (Pause)

BELA'S security monitors register DEAN approaching, but she's not watching.

BELA (continues) Well I'm glad you see it that way. I'll see you at the airstrip in an hour.

BELA ends the call.

BELA picks up the rabbit's foot with kitchen tongs and the Siamese cat hisses.

BELA pauses in front of the security monitors as DEAN moves off-screen; when she glances at the monitors, he's no longer on screen.

BELA puts the rabbit's foot down, opens the wine cooler and extracts a gun from it before moving through the living room toward the front door. The door is ajar. As she approaches, she notices a beeping noise. The alarm system panel is flashing ERROR. A bright yellow Post-It stuck to the panel reads TURN AROUND. DEAN appears behind BELA, his gun drawn. BELA turns and draws her gun.

DEAN You left without your tip.

BELA smirks. DEAN raises his eyebrows.

ACT FOUR
INT. MOTEL ROOM 2 - DAY

SAM rocks back and forth on the chair, bored stiff. Suddenly, the AC unit in the wall in front of SAM starts making a clunking, grinding sound. Smoke starts to pour out.

SAM (Despairingly) Oh come on, I- I didn't- I wasn't... (sighs)

SAM gets up and cautiously approaches the unit. The unit catches on fire. SAM grabs the comforter off one of the beds and attempts to put out the fire with it. When SAM thinks he's got it, he gets up, only to find his jacket sleeve is now on fire. SAM panics and uses the curtain to put it out. The curtain rips and falls away, revealing KUBRICK and CREEDY staring in through the window. SAM falls back, knocking himself out on the floor. KUBRICK smiles and looks to the sky in thanks.


INT. BELA'S APARTMENT - DAY

DEAN and BELA are engaged in a stand-off.

DEAN You're gonna give it back.

BELA (Laughs) Sweetie. No I'm not.

DEAN Yeah, we'll see. Bela, right?

BELA That's right. Dean.

DEAN You know the thing's cursed, don't you?

BELA You'd be surprised what some people would pay for something like that.

DEAN Really?

BELA There's a lucrative market out there. A lot of money to be made. (laughs) You Hunters with all those amulets and talismans you use to stop those big bad monsters. Any one of them could put your children's children through college.

DEAN So you know the truth, about what's really going on out there, and this is what you decide to do with it? You become a thief?

BELA I procure unique items for a select clientele.

DEAN Yeah. A thief.

BELA No, a great thief.


INT. MOTEL ROOM 2 - DAY

CREEDY is restraining SAM to a chair with Duct Tape. SAM comes to.

CREEDY Oh, he's awake!

KUBRIK Back with us, eh?

CREEDY We didn't even have to touch you. You just went all (CREEDY wiggles) spastic, and knocked yourself out? It was like watching Jerry Lewis try to stack chairs!

SAM Who are you, What do you wa-

KUBRICK snaps his fingers in SAM'S face. SAM looks confused.

KUBRIK I used to think your friend Gordon sent me.

SAM Gordon? Oh come on!

KUBRIK Yeah, because he asked me to track you down, and put a bullet in your brain.

SAM Great. That sounds like him.

KUBRIK But, as it turns out ... I'm on a mission from God.

KUBRICK strikes SAM across the face.



DEAN and BELA standoff

INT. BELA'S APARTMENT - DAY

DEAN Look Bela, my brother, he ... touched the foot. And when you took it from him, his luck went from-

BELA I know how it works.

DEAN So then you know he's gonna die unless we can destroy it.

BELA (Insincere) Oh... You can have the foot.

DEAN looks surprised.

BELA For one point five million.

DEAN Nice. Yeah, I'll just call my banker. How'd you even find the damn thing? Stuck in the back of some storage place, middle of nowhere.

BELA looks over her shoulder. Dean follows her gaze to a Ouija Board and planchette on the mantle.

BELA I just asked a few of the ghosts of the people that it killed. They were very attuned into its location.

DEAN So you're only out for yourself, huh? It's all about number one?

BELA Being a Hunter is so much more noble? A bunch of obsessed, revenge-driven sociopaths trying to save a world that can't be saved?

DEAN Well, aren't you a glass half-full?

BELA We're all going to Hell, Dean. Might as well enjoy the ride.

DEAN I actually agree with you there. Anyhoo, this has been charming but uh, look at the time. Oh and ... this?

DEAN reveals the rabbit's foot in his hand. BELA looks pissed.

DEAN Looks like you're not the only one with sticky fingers. If it's any consolation I think you're a truly awful person.

BELA fires at DEAN and misses completely. She fires again, the bullet ricocheting around breaking several objects and hitting the Ouija Board. Dean chuckles and holds out the rabbit's foot to taunt BELA and makes a run for the door. BELA fires again at DEAN'S retreating form, the bullet again ricocheting around and destroying more objects. The Siamese cat runs off and BELA ducks. DEAN escapes.

DEAN Seeya!

BELA sighs.


INT. MOTEL ROOM 2 - DAY

CREEDY throws a glass of water in SAM'S face. SAM'S cheek is bruised and his nose is bloody. SAM shakes the water off while KUBRICK watches, sitting on one of the motel beds.

SAM sighs.

KUBRIK You were a part of that demon plan to open the gate weren't you?

SAM We did everything we could to stop it.

KUBRIK Lie lie lie! You were in on it. You know what their next move is too, don't you?

SAM No, I don't, okay? You're wrong about all of this.

KUBRIK Where are they gonna hit us next?

SAM sighs and stays silent. KUBRICK strikes SAM across the face again. SAM exhales.

KUBRIK WHERE?! Gordon told me about you, Sam. About your powers. You're some kinda weirdo psychic freak?

SAM No, not any more. I – no powers, no visions, nothing, it just—

KUBRIK LIAR!

KUBRICK punches SAM hard.

KUBRIK Now no more lies. There's an army of demons out there pushing at a world already on the brink. We're on deck for the endgame here, right? So maybe, just maybe you can understand (pause, draws his gun) why we can't take chances.

KUBRICK draws his gun and points it at SAM.

SAM Whoa, okay, okay, no, do— hold on a minute! —

CREEDY (tries to intervene) Hey, Kubrick just—

KUBRIK No, you saw what happened, Creedy. Ask yourself, why are we here? Because you saw a picture on the web? Because we chose this motel instead of another? Luck like that doesn't just happen.

SAM Look, I can explain all of that if-

KUBRIK Shut up! (points to SAM without turning around. SAM lets out a long-suffering sigh) It's God, Creedy. He led us here for one reason. To do His work. This ... is destiny.

DEAN Whoa...

Kubrick aims the gun point blank at SAM'S forehead. SAM squeezes his eyes shut. The sound of another gun being cocked is heard in the room.

DEAN Nope. No destiny. Just a rabbit's foot.

KUBRIK Put the gun down, son, or you're gonna be scraping brain off the wall.

DEAN Oh, this thing?

KUBRIK Yeah, that thing.

DEAN Okay. But you see, there's something about me that you don't know.

DEAN puts his gun down, looking smug, and picks up a pen sitting next to it.

KUBRIK Yeah? What would that be?

DEAN It's my lucky day.

DEAN tosses the pen toward KUBRICK. It lodges itself in the barrel of KUBRICK'S gun SAM looks impressed.

DEAN (Laughs) Oh my God, did you see that shot!?

CREEDY lunges at DEAN and aims a punch. DEAN easily side-steps and CREEDY runs straight into the wall, falling backwards and hitting the floor. KUBRICK stares at the pen in the barrel for a few moments before trying to dislodge it.

DEAN I'm amazing.

DEAN picks up the TV remote from the table and throws it hard at KUBRICK, who is just about to aim for DEAN. It hits KUBRICK right between the eyes, knocking him out cold. He drops like a stone.

DEAN (Suave) I'm Batman.

SAM (Sarcastic) Yeah. You're Batman.


END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

SAM is crouching, and sprinkles something onto the embers of a small fire. DEAN is checking over more scratch cards.

SAM All right. Bone ash, cayenne pepper, that should do it.

DEAN One second...

SAM Dean, you—

DEAN Hey, back off, Jinx. I'm bringing home the bacon.

SAM sighs. DEAN smirks and stashes the cards in his jacket, which is slung over a gravestone.

DEAN All right, say goodbye "wascawy wabbit".

The sound of gun is heard cocking. DEAN turns round.

BELA I think you'll find that belongs to me. Or, you know, whatever. (pause) Put the foot down, honey.

DEAN No. You're not going to shoot anybody. See I happen to be able to read people. OK, you're a thief, fine, but you're not—

BELA ignores DEAN, aims at SAM and fires. SAM goes down, groaning.

DEAN Son of a—

BELA Back off, tiger. Back off. You make one more move and I'll pull the trigger.

SAM gets up, clutching his shoulder.

BELA You've got the luck, Dean. You, I can't hit. But your brother? Him I can't miss.

DEAN What the hell is wrong with you?! You don't just go around shooting people like that!

BELA Relax. It's a shoulder hit, I can aim. Besides, who here hasn't shot a few people? Put the rabbit's foot on the ground now.

DEAN All right! All right. Take it easy.

DEAN goes to drop the rabbit's foot, but instead throws it at BELA.

DEAN Think fast.

BELA catches the foot and curses. DEAN smiles in satisfaction.

BELA Damn!

DEAN Now, what do you say we destroy that ugly-ass piece of dead thing?

BELA sighs in annoyance.



LATER:

BELA drops the rabbit's foot in the embers.

BELA Thanks very much. I'm out one and a half million, and on the bad side of a very powerful, fairly psychotic buyer.

DEAN Wow. I really don't feel bad about that. Sam?

SAM Nope. Not even a little.

BELA Hmm. Maybe next time I'll hang you out to dry.

BELA goes and leans on the gravestone where DEAN'S jacket is.

DEAN Oh don't go away angry, just go away.

BELA (Smirks) Have a nice night, boys.

BELA walks away. The rabbit's foot burns in the fire.



later, walking

DEAN You good?

SAM I'll live.

DEAN I guess we're back to normal now, huh? No good luck, no bad luck. Oh! I forgot we're up $46000. I almost forgot about the ... scratch tickets.

DEAN searches his jacket and comes up empty. BELA'S car roars in the distance. SAM and DEAN look at each other, then watch her drive away.


INT. BELA'S CAR - NIGHT

BELA smirks to herself, DEAN'S scratch cards laying beside her. BELA picks up the pile and laughs.


EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

DEAN SON OF A BITCH!


EXT. PRISON - DAY


INT. PRISON

KUBRICK is talking to GORDON. KUBRICK'S nose is taped up.

KUBRIK You were right about everything. Sam Winchester is more than a monster. He's the adversary.

GORDON And what was it that convinced you?

KUBRIK God led me to him, and His will is clear.

GORDON Okaaaaay... That's great. Glad to have you on board. But, uh, first things first. We gotta get me the hell out of here. 'Cause like I told you before, Sam Winchester must die.

GORDON hangs up the two-way phone.
