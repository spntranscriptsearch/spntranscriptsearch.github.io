NOW
EXT. WOODS – NIGHT


A teenage boy, CHRIS, is telling a story to people around a campfire.


CHRIS
Long ago, in these very woods, lived an old woman by the name… of Jenny Greentree.


CHRIS shines the flashlight onto his face from under his chin.


GIRL
Whooo!


The camera pans out and we see there are four people around the campfire – CHRIS, the GIRL sitting next to him, and another teenage boy, RAY, and girl, CHLOE, sitting close together on the other side of the fire.


CHRIS
Forced out after her family was killed in a fire. She lost everything. Some say, even her humanity.


RAY
That is so sad.


CHLOE
Shut up!


CHRIS
It’s a true story, Ray. Look.


CHRIS shines a flashlight onto the letters “JG” carved into a nearby tree.


CHRIS
She carved her initials into that tree… right before she died.


GIRL
Those are not her initials.


We see the scene from a distance, as if through someone else’s eyes.


CHLOE
So, how’d she die?


CHRIS
One night, a blizzard hit. She’s cold, she’s hungry, nowhere to go, no one to turn to. Jenny Greentree froze to death… right beneath that tree. And her evil spirit has haunted these woods ever since.


CHRIS shines the flashlight onto his face from under his chin and grins creepily. RAY gooses CHLOE and she jumps. RAY laughs.


CHLOE
Don’t do that!


Suddenly a bottle smashes against the tree. The GIRL screams and everybody jumps. Another teenage boy, TREVOR, staggers up, laughing drunkenly. CHRIS rolls his eyes.


TREVOR
You guys should have seen your faces!


CHRIS
What the hell, Trevor? That’s not funny, man!


TREVOR
To you!


RAY
[Stands up] Yo. You drive here, man?


TREVOR
Oh, please. Look, why – why don’t you take – take my phone, okay? Call Dad and bust me, why don’t you?


RAY
No, I’m just saying, you’re wasted. You can’t just drive…


TREVOR
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I heard ya. [Laughs uneasily] What was that?


RAY
What? No. Trevor, let’s just sit down, okay, we’ll –


TREVOR
Shhh. You – you don’t hear that?


We see the scene from a distance again.


RAY
Trevor, there’s nothing there, all right? Let’s just sit down, and we’ll…


TREVOR
What the…? You gotta run. You gotta run!


TREVOR runs away.


RAY
Trevor!


CHLOE
I’m sorry, but what is your brother on?


There is a scream in the distance.


RAY
Trevor!


RAY runs after TREVOR.


CUT TO: RAY walking in the woods, looking for TREVOR.


RAY
Trevor! Trev, come on! Stop being a tool!


RAY sees TREVOR sitting against a tree.


RAY
Come on, Trevor, let’s head back. Dude.


TREVOR is dead. His face is cut and bleeding and there is a large hole in his abdomen.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. STREET – DAY


Bell Biv DeVoe's "Poison" plays as a vehicle pulls up outside "Burger Heaven." GARTH gets out, wearing sunglasses, and walks slowly to the restaurant.


♪ Poison ♪

♪ Yeah, Spiderman and Freeze in full effect ♪

♪ Poison ♪

♪ Uh-huh, you ready, Ron? ♪

♪ Poison ♪

♪ I'm ready – you ready, Biv? ♪

CHLOE and the teenage GIRL are talking outside the restaurant.


GARTH
Ladies.


GIRL
What do you want, Top Gun? [Laughs]


GARTH
For starters, I'd like a little respect. [Holds up a badge]


CHLOE
Sorry, Officer. We didn't realize.


GARTH
All's forgiven. Take a seat. Tell me about Trevor McAnn. Other night up at Widow's Peak.


The girls speak simultaneously:


GIRL
Okay. Well, at first it was just like he was super-drunk.


CHLOE
All right. It was weird 'cause he was super-drunk.


GARTH
Whoa. You. [Points to the GIRL] Go.


GIRL
It was Jenny Greentree.


CHLOE
Shut up! Okay? She's just a dumb legend.


GARTH
Hold up. Who?


GIRL
Jenny Greentree. My dad says she really died in the woods. And she's buried in the town cemetery.


EXT. CEMETERY – NIGHT


GARTH is digging in front of Jennifer Greentree’s headstone.


GARTH
All right, Jenny G. [He pours salt into the grave.] Your ganking days are over. [He lights a match and tosses it into the grave.] You've been Garthed.


GARTH walks back to his vehicle in slow motion as "Poison" plays.

CAR – NIGHT


RAY is sitting in a car with a bottle of alcohol beside him. He pushes a button on his cell phone.


CHLOE (voice message)
Ray, where are you? [RAY drinks from another bottle.] You should be with your family right now. Don't do anything stupid. Please.


RAY hits a button to stop the message and takes another drink. He gets out of the car, carrying a rifle.


EXT. WOODS – NIGHT


RAY walks through the woods with his rifle. He sees a long-haired woman in a white dress through the trees and runs towards her. He pauses and looks around, then screams as he is dragged upwards. His legs shake and there is the sound of flesh tearing. Blood runs down his legs and onto his boots and the ground. RAY goes still.


EXT. NIGHT


GARTH is talking on his phone in front of a food van that reads “Guanaco Salvadoran Cuisine.”


GARTH (on phone)
Yeah, I clocked out. Put it to bed. Problem solved. And I'm headed your way, so, uh... fire up that hot tub.

[Chuckles] No, I heart you more.


GARTH gets into his vehicle and opens a take-out container.


VOICE ON POLICE RADIO
Abandoned vehicle out by Widow's Peak. Uh, we got another body up here. Guy's torn to shreds.


GARTH
What?! No way. How is that possible? I Garthed her!


CAR – NIGHT


DEAN is talking on the phone in the passenger seat. SAM is driving.


DEAN (on phone)
All right, well, call us if he wakes up or, you know, anything.

Yeah, fine.

Thanks for your help, Meg.


DEAN hangs up.


DEAN
What a bitch.


SAM
So, Cas is the same, then?


DEAN
Yeah, down to the drool.


SAM
Huh.


DEAN
By the way, how is your custard?


SAM
It's all right. It's getting better. Just wish it wasn't like the damn tape from "The Ring." I mean, I feel like I'm okay 'cause I passed on the crazy.


DEAN
No, you didn't. You heard what Cas said.


DEAN’s phone rings.


SAM
Let's – let's not. You know what?


DEAN answers the phone. The scene alternates between DEAN and SAM in the car and GARTH sitting in his vehicle.


DEAN (on phone)
Hello.


GARTH (on phone)
Hey, Dean. It's Garth.


DEAN (on phone)
Wait. W-who is this?


GARTH (on phone)
Garth. Garth Fitzgerald the Fourth. We worked together on that demon thing? You owe me one?


DEAN (on phone)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, how you doing, Garth?


GARTH (on phone)
I'm ready to cash in that chip, Bra. There's something brewing in Junction City, Kansas.


INT. MORGUE – DAY


A CORONER leads DEAN and SAM in their FBI suits into the room.


CORONER
Well, this is it. Gentlemen... this is Corporal Brown.


GARTH, wearing an Army uniform, is standing next to the body.


GARTH
Corporal James Brown. I'm shipping off to the AF mañana. I'm here to pay respects to my cousin as I will not be able to attend the funeral.


CORONER
That must be terrible for your family. Losing two brothers so fast.


DEAN looks at SAM and SAM looks at GARTH, to whom this is obviously news.


GARTH
Yeah. Yeah. My aunt – she's, uh... she's real broken up about it.


SAM
Hey, Doc, can we see both files, please?


CORONER
Mm-hmm.


The CORONER’s phone rings.


CORONER
Ah. [Hands SAM a file] My wife. I'll, uh, be in my office.


DEAN
Great.


The CORONER leaves the room.


SAM
You didn't say they were brothers.


GARTH
Dude, I just found out about the other corpse, and... started moving quick. I'm sucking up info as I go.


DEAN
What, are you allergic to a suit?


GARTH
No. I just... look good in a uniform.


SAM reads the file.


SAM
Yep. Same cause of death.


SAM walks over to a computer.


GARTH
Right, uh, gutted at night in the woods, where legend says that the ghost of Jenny Greentree roams.


DEAN takes out an EMF meter.


GARTH
Oh, uh, I already scanned for EM... [The EMF reader makes noise.] F. Oh. Um... I guess mine must be broken again.


DEAN
All right. I'm reading your mail. Uh, ghost of Jenny... whatever?


GARTH
Greentree. That's just it. I torched her bones.


DEAN
Yeah, well, maybe she's got something still laying around.


SAM is searching online for “Junction City, Ray, Trevor McAnn.” He opens a web page for the Midwestern Brewing Company, which lists Thighslapper Ale, Headspinner Amber Ale and Hardhead Imperial Stout.


GARTH
Highly doubtful. Chick was homeless.


DEAN looks under the sheet at the body and makes a face.


GARTH
Plus, is it me, or is this less evil spirit, more monster chow?


DEAN
A werewolf?


GARTH
Except, uh, the witness said that whatever was chasing victim numero uno was invisible.


DEAN
Uh… [chuckles] So, invisible ghost werewolf?


GARTH
Why'd you think I called for backup?


SAM
Hey. Either of you ever heard of Thighslapper Ale?


GARTH
Is that a stripper or a beverage?


DEAN
Beverage for douchebags.


SAM
Uh, number one microbrew in the Pacific Northwest.


GARTH
But we're in Kansas.


DEAN
Yeah, I rest my case. What's your point?


SAM
The owner is the dad to the dead brothers.


GARTH
Right. I'll can the uniform, go Fed. See you at the brewery in 40.


GARTH leaves.


DEAN
He grows on you.


INT. MIDWESTERN BREWING COMPANY – DAY


A WOMAN walks through the brewery and opens the door for SAM, DEAN and GARTH, who are all wearing suits.


WOMAN
Agents. I'm Marie. I'm a manager.


DEAN
Thanks for coming in on a Sunday.


MARIE
We want to help. Anything we can do.


MARIE leads them inside.


DEAN
Oh. So all this is your dad's, huh?


MARIE
And his friend – Randy Baxter. They own the place together now.


SAM
Uh..."now"?


MARIE
Well, since Dale died.


MAN (V-O)
Hold on, hold on, hold on. You think I just come in late…


The MAN is standing in an office, lecturing a TEENAGE BOY. Another man is leaning against the wall.


MAN
…whenever I want?


TEENAGE BOY
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.


MARIE
The, uh, "charming" Randy Baxter.


DEAN
Mm.


RANDY BAXTER
Tell you what – congratulations. You're headed for the graveyard shift. Be one second late, and you're fired.


TEENAGE BOY
Yes, sir.


MARIE
He's actually a really nice guy. It's just not easy being the axman.


DEAN
So true.


GARTH
My comrades got you covered, so if you'll excuse me.


SAM
Uh, yeah, I'll go with you.


SAM and GARTH walk into the office.


SAM
Mr. McAnn? Uh, we'll be brief. I promise.


GARTH
Mr. McAnn, is there any reason to believe your sons may have had enemies?


MR. MCANN
We were told they were animal attacks.


SAM
We just need to explore every possibility.


MR. MCANN
They got lots of friends. No.


SAM
Well, do they work here with you? Like Marie does. Uh, could someone have been jealous?


MR. MCANN
N-no. Marie's the only one. Oh – no. Th– there's no... Uh...


RANDY BAXTER
Jim. It's okay. It's okay. [to SAM and GARTH] Let him get some rest. I'll answer your questions.


SAM
Of course.


JIM MCANN leaves the room.


CUT TO: MARIE and DEAN walking through the brewery.


MARIE
He blamed himself when Dale died, and now this.


DEAN
Why did he blame himself?


MARIE
Well, Dale was sensitive. But what do you do – watch them 24/7? You can't blame Dale's friends.


DEAN
But your dad still feels bad.


MARIE
And it doesn't help Dale's wife is suing us.


DEAN
Really? Why?


MARIE
She's angry and grieving, and this is America?


CUT TO: SAM and GARTH talking to RANDY BAXTER in the office.


RANDY BAXTER
I knew Ray and Trevor. Hell, I'm godfather to all four of Jim's kids. Ray and Trevor loved their fun, but they'd never do anything crazy.


GARTH
No rugrats of your own?


RANDY BAXTER
Just Jim's. They'd borrow my car, raid my fridge.


SAM
Now, the two of you started this company with a third partner. Right?


RANDY BAXTER
Yeah. Dale. [The camera pans in on two framed photographs of the three men.] He passed away a few months ago.


GARTH
Passed away in the woods or...?


RANDY BAXTER
He took his own life.


GARTH
Oh. Sorry.


RANDY BAXTER
Well, he had problems for a long time. Look, this is just a nightmare.


SAM notices a wooden box with Japanese characters written on it next to a tray of drinks behind the desk.


RANDY BAXTER
First Dale, now this. This was gonna be our big year. We're selling Thighslapper to one of the largest distributors in the US. It's been in the works for months. News is gonna hit public pretty soon.


GARTH
Well, that's the brass ring, huh?


RANDY BAXTER
Given other circumstances, yeah, we'd be celebrating right about now.


INT. HOUSE – DAY


We see a close-up of a family photo of JIM MCANN, RAY, TREVOR, MARIE, another woman, LILLIAN, and a YOUNG GIRL on LILLIAN’s lap.


LILLIAN is carrying a bottle of vodka in the kitchen. She pours some into one of two glasses of orange juice and takes a sip, then carries both glasses to the next room, where the YOUNG GIRL is drawing at a table.


LILLIAN
That looks great, sweetie.


LILLIAN sets both glasses on the table. There is a knock at the door.


JIM MCANN
Hello?


WOMAN
There's Grandpa. Hi.


LILLIAN walks to the entryway and hugs JIM MCANN. The YOUNG GIRL picks up one of the glasses of orange juice and takes a drink. From her face it is clear that she picked up the glass with the vodka.


YOUNG GIRL
Oops.


LILLIAN
I'll get some snacks. You should eat.


JIM MCANN
Yeah.


LILLIAN
Sit, Dad.


The YOUNG GIRL giggles.


JIM MCANN
Hey, what you drawing?


YOUNG GIRL
My world.


The YOUNG GIRL giggles as she draws. She looks up and sees something move through the air and then a long-haired woman in a white dress walk into the entryway. The YOUNG GIRL gets up and looks around the entryway, then walks into the kitchen. LILLIAN is making sandwiches. The YOUNG GIRL can see the long-haired woman in the white dress standing behind LILLIAN. JIM MCANN walks into the kitchen.


JIM MCANN
What is it, sweetie?


The YOUNG GIRL points. JIM MCANN can see only LILLIAN behind the counter.


WOMAN
What is it?


The YOUNG GIRL continues to point. LILLIAN turns and gasps as she sees the woman in the white dress. The YOUNG GIRL screams as LILLIAN turns to try to get away. The woman in the white dress puts her fist through LILLIAN’s back. JIM MCANN grabs the YOUNG GIRL and turns her face away.


JIM MCANN
Lillian!


JIM MCANN can only see LILLIAN, with her back arched and her arms outstretched. The camera angle changes to show LILLIAN from the front with the woman in the white dress behind her. LILLIAN looks down to see a hand protruding through her body beneath her shirt. She falls to the floor.


ACT TWO
INT. MOTEL – NIGHT


GARTH is working on an EMF reader. DEAN is sitting on a sofa reading a journal.


DEAN
There's a million things with claws go bump in the night.


SAM is sitting at the table using the laptop.


DEAN
Once you throw in "invisible," the number goes down.


DEAN picks up a motel card on the table next to him.


DEAN
"Afternoon Delights"? Really, Garth? Don't you think this place is a little, uh...


GARTH
Uh, you want a nice hot tub after a day at the office. It's the little things. I feel sad for those brewery dudes. Spend your life beautifying the world through beer. First a partner offs himself.


DEAN drinks from his flask.


GARTH
Now two kids get ganked by unknown freakadeek.


SAM
According to this, Dale wasn't just a partner. [The laptop screen shows an article on the Midwestern Brewing Company.] He was also the brewmaster.


DEAN
"Brewmaster"?


SAM
He was widely considered a genius.


DEAN
All right, that's it. [He gets up.] No microbrew is worth… [He puts his flask down on the counter near GARTH and the EMF reader starts to make noise.] ...what was it – eight Food Magazine awards? [He takes beer bottles out of the fridge.] Beer's not food. It's... [He puts a bottle down for GARTH.] ...whatever water is.


DEAN gives SAM a bottle and inspects the label on his own bottle.


DEAN
Hmm. Thighslapper. [He takes a drink.] Wow, that's actually awesome. Damn it, I'm not even mad anymore.


DEAN and SAM watch GARTH drink the entire contents of his bottle and shake the last few drops into his mouth. GARTH belches.


DEAN
Wow. Party on, Garth.


GARTH
I don't even usually drink beer. It messes with my depth perception. [He belches again and hiccups.] Especially when I skinny-dip. [SAM and DEAN look at each other.] Hey, you guys want to hear a joke?


SAM
Listen to this. This is something interesting.


GARTH laughs.


SAM
Garth, are you drunk?


GARTH
Dude, I just... drank a whole beer. Of course I'm drunk. [He belches again.]


DEAN
Something interesting?


SAM
Right. Uh...


GARTH
Hey, can I have some more Thighslapper?


SAM
No.


DEAN
No. Coffee for you, Tara Reid.


GARTH
Coffee with kalhúa in it?


SAM
So, it says that Dale actually left the company two weeks before he died. Or... maybe he got pushed out 'cause he didn't want to sell. I mean, Baxter said the deal's been in the works for months.


DEAN
That would explain the widow. She's suing. Maybe Dale had a bone to pick, and he's still picking it.


GARTH
Right. So, maybe he's a spirito malo.


VOICE ON POLICE RADIO
Unit to McAnn residence. 698 Washburn.


SAM
"McAnn residence," as in Jim McAnn?


GARTH
As in, let's hope for their sake our spirito ain't made it out of the woods. All right. Let's go check it.


SAM
Uh, you two go. I'm gonna visit the widow.


DEAN looks at SAM, who smiles at him.


EXT. MCANN HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN (V-O)
Well?


GARTH (V-O)
Place is clean.


INT. MCANN HOUSE – NIGHT


GARTH and DEAN are standing in the entryway of the house.


GARTH
My EMF is a nada. [He takes another EMF reader out of his jacket pocket.] So is this one.


DEAN
Is that mine?


GARTH
Yeah. I borrowed it in case mine's broke.


DEAN
Oh.


GARTH
So, uh... we still on invisible werewolf?


DEAN
Maybe, maybe not. I can't get Tess to talk, but I get the feeling she saw something.


We see the YOUNG GIRL, TESS, sitting on a sofa with JIM MCANN and MARIE on either side of her.


GARTH
I'm gonna take a run at her.


DEAN
A what?


GARTH
Trust me. My special lady has twins. [Goes into the living room] Mr. McAnn?


DEAN
"Special lady?” [He follows GARTH.]


GARTH
Do you mind if we speak to Tess alone for just a sec? It would really help.


JIM MCANN
Honey, we'll... we'll be right out there, okay?


GARTH
Thanks.


JIM MCANN and MARIE leave the room.


GARTH
Hi, Tess. [He sits down on the coffee table in front of TESS.] You want to tell me what you saw tonight?


TESS shakes her head.


GARTH
Or maybe you'll talk to... [Raises a hand in a sock puppet and speaks in a high-pitched voice] …Mr. Fizzles! [Waves the puppet around] I'm your friend! Yay!


DEAN
Garth. Why don't we put the sock away?


GARTH
[in his Mr Fizzles voice] Mr. Fizzles wants to help Tess. He wants to listen.


DEAN
Mr. Fizzles is gonna go where the sun don't shine.


TESS
It was a monster.


GARTH
[in his Mr Fizzles voice] I believe you, Tess. Did it have claws?


TESS nods.


DEAN
How come you were the only one that could see it, Tess?


TESS shrugs.


GARTH
[in his Mr Fizzles voice] What else, Tess?


TESS shrugs.


GARTH
[in his Mr Fizzles voice] You sure? 'Cause Mr. Fizzles can sense when you're being a... [deep voice] liar.


DEAN
All right. That's – that's enough... Mr. Fizzles.


TESS
I drank a grown-up drink.


DEAN
Uh, grown-up like, uh, coffee? [TESS shakes her head.] Well, you mean alcohol?


TESS
It was an accident. Don't let them arrest me, Mr. Fizzles.


GARTH looks at DEAN and points Mr Fizzles at him. GARTH and Mr Fizzles nod.


INT. DALE’S WIDOW’S HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM
Your husband did a lot of traveling, huh?


DALE’S WIDOW
He went to all kinds of exotic places for the best ingredients.


SAM
Right. I've tried his work. It's – it's great. Um, I hear you're not exactly on the best of terms with Dale's old partners.


DALE’S WIDOW
Well, they sold his company right out from under him. It's not about money. It's about... It was his baby, you know?


SAM
You sound pretty upset about it.


DALE’S WIDOW
I'm furious. I hate them. But then I think how Dale was.


SAM
What do you mean?


DALE’S WIDOW
His friends left him behind, but you know what he said? "I'm gonna send them a gift that shows I forgive them."


SAM
Do you have any idea what he sent them?


DALE’S WIDOW
Bottle of sake. From one of his trips. In a... gorgeous box with writing. He was so careful with it. Wouldn't let me touch it.


CAR – NIGHT


GARTH is driving.


DEAN
So, kid in the woods sees something that nobody else does. Then Tess sees a monster, and Jim doesn't. What's the thread?


GARTH
Hmm. Well, certain mutants see infrared.


DEAN
"Grown-up drinks." Tess chugged her mom's, and vic number one was plastered.


GARTH
Right. So... Whoa. Monster you got to be drunk to see. Cool! Also... hard to fight.


DEAN takes a drink from his flask.


DEAN
Ahh. Just getting in the zone. You are strictly on wine coolers.


GARTH
Hey, I love those. Anything sweet. [chuckles] Whoo! [chuckles]


DEAN takes another drink.


GARTH
So, uh, what's with the Grody flask anyway? Lucky charm?


DEAN
It's Bobby's.


FLASHBACK to DEAN putting the flask down on the counter at the motel and the EMF reader reacting.


DEAN (in flashback)
No microbrew is worth – what was it – eight...


GARTH
Hmm. Really? 'Cause, um... You think there's a possibility that Bobby's riding your wave?


DEAN
No, we gave him a hunter's wake.


GARTH
Yeah, I-I burned my cousin Brandon, and he stayed stuck. And – and – and they got ghosts in India, and they cremate everybody over there. It's just instinct, but maybe there is EMF around here. It just ain't the job.


DEAN
All right, we're not gonna talk about this, okay? Not in the middle of work.


GARTH
Sorry.


DEAN’s phone rings.


GARTH
Just hope that fire did the trick.


DEAN (on phone)
Hey, Sam.

Yeah. Got it. We're on our way.


EXT. BREWERY – NIGHT


GARTH is in the car, which is parked outside the brewery. SAM picks the lock on the brewery door and he and DEAN enter.


INT. BREWERY – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN walk through the brewery to the office.


SAM
Here it is.


SAM picks up the wooden box with Japanese writing, sets it on the desk and opens it. Inside is a fancy box decorated with a face and more Japanese characters, and inside that box is the bottle of saki. The seal is broken.


SAM
Oh. [He shakes the bottle.] Wait a second. Someone's been sampling the goods.


DEAN
Oh, you don't say? [He looks up.] Hey, check it out. God, I love paranoid people.


The camera angle changes as if the scene was being recorded by a security camera.


DEAN
[Motioning towards the computer] See if you can get on.


SAM
Okay. Uh...


SAM brings up an image of himself and DEAN behind the desk.


SAM
Huh!


DEAN and SAM wave at the camera.


SAM
All right, so, first death was, what, uh, four months ago? Yeah?


DEAN
Mm-hmm, and, uh, Trevor McAnn. Patient zero.


SAM
So, what did he let out of that bottle?


SAM plays the security footage, which shows JIM MCANN and RANDY BAXTER in the office, the cleaner, and TREVOR.


SAM
Nothing there.


DEAN
That we can see.


The security footage shows TREVOR taking some bottles from the office.


DEAN puts a bottle and a glass on the desk and claps SAM on the shoulder.


SAM
What, are you kidding me?


SAM
Tick-tock.


SAM pours himself a glass of whiskey.


DEAN
Ugh. [He puts the cap back on a bottle.]


SAM
I mean, can you even get drunk anymore? It's kind of like, uh, drinking a vitamin for you, right?


DEAN
Shut up. [He sniffs another bottle.] Holy... [He drinks from the bottle and coughs.]


DEAN pours himself a glass of a clear liqueur and clinks glasses with SAM. They both drink. SAM pours himself another glass of whiskey. They both drain their glasses.


DEAN
All right. Party time.


SAM
Okay.


DEAN
Rewind and go.


SAM plays the footage of TREVOR. They can now see the long-haired woman in the white dress standing in the office.


SAM
So, he – he let that thing out of the box, and it must have just followed him to the place with all the thingies.


DEAN
Yes. Yes. That's smart. I'm actually kind of drunk. [Looks at his empty glass] What is this? [Pours himself another glass] Me likey. I miss these talks.


DEAN takes a drink, but spits it out again as RANDY BAXTER comes into the office.


RANDY BAXTER
What the hell?!


DEAN
Oh, man.


SAM
Uh...


DEAN
Turn it off. Turn it off.


RANDY BAXTER
FBI, huh? You know what? [Pushes buttons on his phone] You can save it for the cops.


SAM
Whoa, whoa, Mr. Baxter, listen. If – if you just let us explain, you might not –


RANDY BAXTER
Aah!


RANDY BAXTER falls to the floor. GARTH has Tasered him.


VOICE ON RANDY BAXTER’S PHONE
911. What is your emergency? Hello? Do you need assistance?


ACT THREE
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JAPANESE RESTAURANT – NIGHT


A JAPANESE MAN in a restaurant uniform is reading the Japanese writing on the saki box. SAM and DEAN are holding coffees.


JAPANESE MAN
Anata ga marou mono... Wa anata ka ra mo morau. It says, "what you took will be taken from you." Like, eye for an eye. You with me?


SAM nods.


JAPANESE MAN
Kono bin niwa syoujou zuke no sake ga hu-in sarete iru. Where'd you guys get this anyway?


SAM
Why? Is – is there, uh, something the matter?


JAPANESE MAN
Well, you're not superstitious, are you? [He gives the box to SAM.]


DEAN
Not at all.


SAM
No, no.


JAPANESE MAN
Because...this says the bottle inside contains a Shojo.


DEAN
What's a... Shojo?


JAPANESE MAN
An alcohol spirit. Look, it's just an old myth. I wouldn't worry about it. But they are not known for being friendly.


Someone inside the restaurant shouts in Japanese and the JAPANESE MAN shouts in return.


JAPANESE MAN
I got to go.


DEAN
Oh. Uh, hey, uh... There you go. [He hands the JAPANESE MAN some money.] Thank you.


JAPANESE MAN
Thank you.


DEAN
Yeah.


JAPANESE MAN
Take care.


INT. MOTEL – NIGHT


DEAN and SAM enter. GARTH is performing some sort of martial art exercises in the courtyard to the rear of the room.


SAM
Garth. Where's Baxter?


GARTH comes into the room and points.


GARTH
Dude's a lot heavier than he looks, FYI.


RANDY BAXTER is in the hot tub with a pillowcase over his head.


GARTH
But here. [Indicates DEAN’s EMF reader] Thought you might want this back.


DEAN
You have the CEO of the douchiest microbrew in the US gagged in your hot tub? You really think that's gonna end well?


GARTH
I'm not feeling the love.


SAM
All right. Shojo. Uh, let's see what we can see. [He sits down at the table to use the laptop.]


GARTH
What's Shojo?


DEAN
Japanese booze monster.


GARTH
I guess that would explain why you got to be drunk to see it. Very poetic.


SAM does a search for “Shojo” and clicks on the first link, which is to the page “Open Minds to Deeper Knowledge.” The text is in Japanese and there is a black-and-white drawing. GARTH looks over SAM’s shoulder.


GARTH
Ooh. Creepy.


A message box that says “Translating Japanese text to English” pops up on screen and then the page appears in English. It reads:

A Shojo (Heavy drinker or Orangutan) is a kind of Japanese sea spirit with a red face and hair and a fondness for alcohol. Legend has it, that workers at the breweries in Japan have seen a Shojo lurking about after indulging in their products. With the right Spell Box you can harness a Shojo to your will. The legend is the subject of a Noh play of the same name. There is a Noh mask for this character, as well as a type of Kabuki stage makeup, that bares [sic] the name. The Chinese and Japanese characters for Orangutan are the same, and can also be used in Japanese to refer to someone who is particularly fond of alcohol. Fatal weakness: Samurai sword consecrated with a Shinto blessing.


SAM
Okay. So, a Shojo is said to roam where there's lots of alcohol. There's lore saying that, back in the old day, if you were plastered enough, you could see one skulking around the breweries in Japan.


DEAN is refilling his flask with whiskey.


DEAN
Yeah, but why is this one shredding brewers' kids?


SAM
Apparently, you can harness the will of a Shojo with the right spell box. Then you basically have an attack dog that you can sic on whatever sort of personal revenge mission you want.


DEAN
So Dale nabs one to punish his pals.


SAM
Send the bottle, sooner or later it's popped open. Then you have a Shojo that will do whatever Dale compelled it to do right here on the box.


GARTH
Wait. Except it's not killing the people that screwed him over.


SAM
Well, Dale's widow said the company was his baby. So, if he really wanted his friends to feel what he felt...


DEAN
He would take theirs. Well, their kids. Jim's, anyways.


SAM
And Baxter was the godfather.


DEAN
All right, skip to how do we gank it.


SAM
Good news. It is killable.


DEAN
But...


SAM
But only with a samurai sword consecrated with a Shinto blessing.


DEAN
Well... that's not a silver lining. All right, the Shojo already cleaned house, right? I mean, Marie's the last target standing, so... I'll hit the pawn shops and, uh, look for the sword, and you babysit Marie.


GARTH drops and catches an EMF reader, which starts to make noise.


GARTH
Yikes. Sorry.


DEAN grabs the EMF reader from GARTH.


DEAN
Don't worry about it.


DEAN turns the EMF reader off.


GARTH
Unless I've got nothing to be sorry for.


DEAN
Garth.


SAM
What's he talking about?


GARTH
I'm concerned that Bobby might be haunting you. I-I brought it up to Dean, and he shot me down.


DEAN
Garth! Leave it alone.


SAM
It's okay.


DEAN
No, it's far from okay.


SAM
I've already tried contacting Bobby. [DEAN looks surprised.] When that beer disappeared, I pulled out a talking board.


DEAN
Without me?


SAM
You know, I figured, why drag you in... when it's something I could just put to bed myself.


DEAN
And?


SAM
And if he was there, I'd have told you.


RANDY BAXTER groans.


DEAN
Talk about this later. You follow Marie. Let me borrow your keys.


CUT TO: GARTH removes the pillowcase from RANDY BAXTER’s head.


GARTH
I'm trying to help you, Mr. Baxter.


RANDY BAXTER
And who the hell are you?


GARTH
Now, I'm confused. Dale goes to get you all where it hurts – the kids. Only, you don't have any kids.


RANDY BAXTER
It still affects me. Believe me.


GARTH
Nah. You want to tell me what you're hiding?


RANDY BAXTER
Hiding? I –


GARTH
Tell me this. When was the last time you gave an employee three chances?


RANDY BAXTER
Probably never.


GARTH
Exactly. You're the axman, right? Tough job, but, hey, somebody's got to. So, how come you cut that slacker janitor so many breaks?


RANDY BAXTER
I-I-I-I don’t know.


GARTH
Yeah. Well, I Googled. Come to find his mother... was your secretary way back in the day. Of course, you were married to Mrs. B., so, uh... No way there's anything naughty there, right? What do you need to get? It don't matter what Dale knows about you, 'cause that thing out there killing the kids – it knows!


RANDY BAXTER
It didn't end well with his mom. She made me swear never to tell him.


GARTH
Oh. So much for that. Where is he?


RANDY BAXTER
He's, uh – he's at the brewery.


GARTH takes a bunch of miniature bottles of alcohol from under the counter.


RANDY BAXTER
Working the graveyard shift.


GARTH
Here. [He tosses RANDY BAXTER the keys to the handcuffs chaining him to the hot tub rail.] If you care about that kid at all, don't call the cops on me just yet.


INT. BREWERY – NIGHT


RANDY BAXTER’S SON sprays window cleaner all over the inside of the glass door. When he wipes it off, we see that the Shojo is standing on the other side of the door, but it appears that he can’t see her.


ACT FOUR
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JAPANESE RESTAURANT – NIGHT


DEAN takes a sword out of its scabbard and lays it down on a wooden box. The JAPANESE MAN is reading from a piece of paper.


JAPANESE MAN
It says it's best to do this in a running spring.


DEAN
Uh, yeah. I, uh… [Takes a bottle of spring water out of his jacket] I got it. Okay. We good?


JAPANESE MAN
I'll do my best.


DEAN
All right.


DEAN picks up the sword and prepares to pour water over it.


JAPANESE MAN
Shichihukujin... [In English] Go.


DEAN
Oh. [He pours water over the sword.]


JAPANESE MAN
Hito no teni rori korekara seitoun yakuwari wo hatasu kono ken wo tataer.


DEAN continues pouring water onto the sword.


JAPANESE MAN
That's it.


DEAN
Oh. [He stops pouring.] All right. Uh, thanks. [He hands over some money.] There.


JAPANESE MAN
Thank you.


DEAN
Yeah.


DEAN’s phone rings as he is putting the sword back into its scabbard.


DEAN
Aah.


DEAN (on phone)
Hey, Garth.


EXT. BREWERY – NIGHT


GARTH is hurrying towards the brewery. He drops an empty miniature bottle of alcohol. The scene alternates between GARTH at the brewery and DEAN outside the Japanese restaurant.


GARTH (on phone)
Dean, Baxter's got a secret love child! The Shojo might come for him first!


DEAN (on phone)
Whoa, slow down!


GARTH (on phone)
I'm trying to save lives here!


GARTH fumbles for tools to break into the brewery.


DEAN (on phone)
Are you drunk?


GARTH drops his phone.


GARTH
Damn it! Damn it.


DEAN (on phone)
Garth?


GARTH gets the door open and enters the brewery.


DEAN (on phone)
You dropped the phone, didn't you? Hello? Garth!


GARTH (on phone)
[Going up the stairs in the brewery] Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm here.


DEAN (on phone)
Where the hell are you?


GARTH (on phone)
I'm in the brewery.


INT. BAR – NIGHT


SAM is at the bar drinking whiskey. Behind him, MARIE is at a table. SAM signals the bartender for another drink.


INT. BREWERY – NIGHT


GARTH can see the Shojo watching RANDY BAXTER’S SON.


DEAN (on phone)
Garth?


GARTH (on phone)
[whispering] Dean. It's here.


EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JAPANESE RESTAURANT – NIGHT


DEAN gets into GARTH’s vehicle.


INT. BREWERY – NIGHT


GARTH grabs RANDY BAXTER’S SON by the arm.


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Whoa, whoa, hey! What the hell?!


GARTH
Come with me if you want to live!


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Hey!


INT. BAR – NIGHT


SAM’s phone rings.


SAM (on phone)
Yeah.


DEAN (on phone)
Hey, you good to drive? [SAM is drinking his whiskey.]


SAM (on phone)
Uh...


DEAN (on phone)
Well, get a ride. It's at the brewery.


SAM (on phone)
What?


DEAN (on phone)
There's another kid. Don't think – move.


EXT. BAR – NIGHT


SAM leaves the bar. A valet is helping a couple into a taxi.


SAM
Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Taxi! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Stop! Hold on, hold on. National security! [He holds up a badge.] Please! [The woman who was about to get into the taxi steps back.] Thank you, ma'am. Sorry. Thanks, guys. [He gets into the taxi.] Okay. Brewery. Step on it!


TAXI DRIVER
What?


SAM
The brewery! Hurry! Hurry. Hurry, hurry. Please?


TAXI DRIVER
Yeah, but I like to drive safe, you know.


INT. BREWERY – NIGHT


GARTH is leading RANDY BAXTER’S SON by the arm.


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Dude, what's going on? Who are you?


GARTH
I'm the law, son. Now, follow me.


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Are you drunk, dude? [He breaks away from GARTH.] Get away from me!


GARTH
All right. I'll just shoot. Baxter is your father. Baxter screwed Dale. Dale roped this Japanese monster you can only see when you're drunk, and now it's here to kill you.


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Whoa, wait a minute. Baxter is my father?


GARTH looks past RANDY BAXTER’S SON and sees the Shojo approaching. He grabs RANDY BAXTER’S SON and tries to drag him away. RANDY BAXTER’S SON looks from GARTH to the direction of the Shojo.


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
What are you looking at?


GARTH
[Pulls RANDY BAXTER’S SON by the arm] Damn it, run!


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
[Breaks away from GARTH again] Dude, there's nothing there!


The Shojo appears right in front of GARTH. GARTH smiles at it. The Shojo sends GARTH flying into a wall of glass windows. RANDY BAXTER’S SON runs. He rounds a corner and stands with his back to the wall. As he starts to run for an open door, it slams shut. Large scratches appear on the wall in front of him. He opens the door and continues to run through the brewery. SAM appears from the other direction.


SAM
Whoa. Whoa. Easy!


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
We got to get out of here, man. [He pushes past SAM, who follows him.] It's here!


SAM
Where's Garth?


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Who?!


SAM
Garth!


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
I-I – There was a guy – he got knocked out!


SAM
Oh. Oh, okay.


SAM can see the Shojo approaching.


SAM
Stay behind me. Stay behind me.


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Okay, okay. What, you can – you can see it?


SAM
Yeah. I'm – I’m skunked. Just, uh... [SAM looks to his right and sees an open door.] Fire exit. On three.


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Okay.


SAM
All right?


The door slams shut.


SAM
Okay. So much for that.


The Shojo appears right in front of SAM and throws him into the wall hard enough to crack it. SAM falls to the ground, unconscious. DEAN appears and puts a hand on RANDY BAXTER’S SON’s shoulder.


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Aah!


DEAN
Get back!


DEAN pushes RANDY BAXTER’S SON behind him and slashes with the sword. The Shojo hits him and he falls to the ground. The sword skids along the flood. DEAN sits up and looks at SAM, who is still unconscious. He then looks for the sword, which slides back along the floor towards him. SAM wakes. DEAN gets to his feet.


DEAN
Where is it?!


SAM
Uh, s-s-swing right!


DEAN slashes to his left with the sword.


SAM
My right.


DEAN slashes again as the Shojo ducks.


SAM
3 o’clock, Dean! [DEAN slashes again.] 6 o’clock!


RANDY BAXTER’S SON ducks as DEAN swings the sword. DEAN then plunges the sword into the Shojo and takes his hand from the hilt of the sword. The Shojo materializes, screams and falls backwards as it disappears. DEAN picks up the sword.


DEAN
You okay?


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
I'm alive. Yeah.


DEAN
Sam?


SAM
Yeah. [He gives a thumb’s-up.]


DEAN
Where's Garth?


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
Well, he's – he's over this way.


DEAN
Would you go get him?


RANDY BAXTER’S SON
All right.


SAM gets up and follows RANDY BAXTER’S SON. DEAN looks at the sword, and then in the direction from which it moved towards him.


CUT TO: GARTH sits up with a hand to his head as SAM and RANDY BAXTER’S SON approach.


GARTH
What'd I miss?


CUT TO: DEAN standing with the sword.


DEAN
This moved. Bobby? Are you here? Come on, do something.


SAM is watching from behind a corner.


ACT FIVE
EXT. MOTEL – DAY


GARTH is walking to his vehicle, carrying a bag.


GARTH
You sure you guys don’t want to hang out? Grab some brunch, maybe some brews?


DEAN
Tempting, but, uh, we better roll.


GARTH
All right, well…


GARTH hugs DEAN.


DEAN
Oh. Yeah.


DEAN and SAM raise their eyebrows at each other.


GARTH
Call me anytime.


DEAN
All right.


GARTH
And you, Sam.


GARTH and SAM shake hands.


SAM
Yeah.


GARTH
Aw, come here.


GARTH hugs SAM.


SAM
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Garth.


GARTH
Sayonara, kemosabes! [He points to DEAN and SAM’s current vehicle, an AMC Pacer.] Nice ride.


GARTH gets into his vehicle and starts the engine.


SAM
You’re right. He has grown on me.


GARTH drives away, loud music playing.


♪ Poison ♪

♪ Poison ♪

♪ Poison ♪


DEAN raises a hand in farewell.


SAM
All right, um… So, let’s talk about it.


DEAN
About what? Oh. The, uh, talking board? That’s fine. I get it, I guess.


SAM
No, not that. Look, I heard you.


DEAN
Heard me what?


SAM
What happened in the brewery, Dean?


DEAN
Nothing. It was, uh – it was just my imagination.


DEAN turns to go inside the motel room and SAM follows him.


SAM
Dean, look, I know something happened.


INT. MOTEL – DAY


SAM
I just want you to be straight with me.


DEAN
The blade was across the room [flashback to the blade sliding across the floor towards DEAN earlier in this episode] and then it was in my hand. And then my beer [flashback to Dean holding an empty beer bottle in 7.11 Adventures in Babysitting] drank itself. [Flashback to the piece of paper on the bed in 7.13 The Slice Girls.] Oh, and then that page magically appeared on the bed. [Flashback to SAM holding the piece of paper in 7.13 The Slice Girls.] And – and then Bobby’s book fell down and out popped [flashback to Bobby’s address book on the floor and the Mackey’s Taxidermy business card in 7.17 The Born-Again Identity] the number of the guy who found Cas. Nothing, I’m sure.


SAM
Clearly.


DEAN
Well then what, Sam? Is Bobby here, or not?


SAM
You know what I think, Dean? I think that regular people, they see ones they lost everywhere too.


DEAN
Yeah, freakin’ ghosts!


SAM
Or they just miss ‘em a lot. I mean, they see a face in a crowd, we see a book falling off the table. Same thing, Dean. I did the talking board, I ran plenty of EMF. When that beer when poof – I went a little nuts.


DEAN
Yeah, why didn’t you tell me?


SAM
Like I said, little nuts at the time.


DEAN
All right, well, if it wasn’t Bobby, then what Jedi’d that sword into my hand?


SAM
The Shojo slammed the door from across the room. Maybe it was trying to grab the sword, too.


DEAN
[clears throat] Right. Right, I mean if it was Bobby, he would let us know. I mean, who knows more about being a ghost than Bobby? Instant Swayze, right?


SAM
Exactly.


DEAN
Okay. Okay, you – so your theory is that – that we’re practically regular people about something for once. All right. [They pick up their bags.] Well, you want to grab some brunch and some brews?


SAM
Ugh, no. I’m so hung over. Let’s just hit the road.


DEAN
All right.


DEAN opens the door and motions SAM out. They leave the room. The camera pans out and we see BOBBY’S GHOST standing in the room looking after them. BOBBY’S GHOST sighs.


EXT. MOTEL – DAY


DEAN and SAM get into the car. DEAN starts the engine.


DEAN
Hang on.


DEAN gets out of the car and goes back inside the motel.


INT. MOTEL – DAY


DEAN looks around the room. BOBBY’S GHOST is looking back at him.


DEAN
There you are.


BOBBY’S GHOST smiles. DEAN walks towards him and picks up his flask.


BOBBY’S GHOST
I’m right here, you idjit!


DEAN pauses on his way out the door, but then closes the door behind him.


BOBBY’S GHOST
Balls!


BOBBY’S GHOST flickers and disappears.


EXT. MOTEL – DAY


DEAN gets back into the car and he and SAM drive away.
