[INTERIOR: LaVeau art gallery in Portland, Oregon. Rowena stands at the bar, on the phone.]

Rowena: Hello boys. I’m very sure I've done nothing that you know of to make you want to call, but how lovely to hear from you.

[intercut with INTERIOR: The bunker library. Sam, Dean and Cas on speakerphone]

Sam: Rowena, that’s not…we, um...

Rowena: You’ll have to speak up.

Dean: We need your help.

Rowena: Really?

Castiel: We must assemble our most powerful allies to rescue our family and confront the Archangel Michael. Now, he's in an alternate universe so--

Rowena: Ah, the handsome angel is there, isn’t he? Hello tweety pie.

Castiel: Um, hello.

Rowena: Lads, obviously I’d love to help after what you… oh, Sam<i/> did for me but I’m in the damp Pacific Northwest right now working on my own little project.

Dean: Project?

Sam: What project?

Rowena: Oh, nothing for you to worry about. Just checking a few items off my little to-do list.

Dean: Sure, that didn’t sound ominous.

Sam: Rowena, are you at a... party or something?

Rowena: I am, but I’m surprised you recognise the sounds of a party, seeing as how you're all work and no play.

Dean: Look, we didn’t call to talk. We…the world is in danger, Rowena.

Rowena: And I’m currently surrounded by art that makes me think the world <i>should be in danger. Best of luck to you boys. My three little musketeers. Mwah.

[she hangs up]

Dean: Damn it.

Castiel: You know, she’s right. You never go to parties.

[Sam and Dean exchange looks of disbelief and Dean shakes his head.]


[INTERIOR: Art gallery party]

Rowena [approaches one of the guests]: Good afternoon.

Elizabeth: Hello.

Rowena: You’re Elizabeth Mahler, aren’t you?.

Elizabeth: Yes. Do I know you?

Rowena: No, but I know you. I saw you in the newspaper, didn’t I? In the Oregon Tribune?

Elizabeth: There’s no need to bring up any of that unpleasantness.

Rowena: Of course not, my humblest apologies. [tango music starts up] Bernard, this is my song! Be a darling, will you? [She givess Elizabeth her handbag and then says to her] Glad you could make it too. [Rowena dances the tango with Bernard and at the last move he dips her in front of Elizabeth. Rowena mutters] Mors Lumena!

[Elizabeth screams and spontaneously combusts. Rowena smiles at Bernard.]


--TITLE CARD--


ACT 1
[INTERIOR: the bunker kitchen. Dean makes himself a cup of coffee and talks with Cas]

Dean: You know what? Forget Rowena. There’s gotta be some other way we can track down Gabriel and hijack his grace.

Castiel: Even though he could be any place on earth?

Dean: Yes.

Castiel: Or technically, anywhere in the entire universe.

Dean: I didn’t say it was gonna be easy, but uh… All right, come on. Ideas. [closes his eyes and rubs his hands together] Come on. Here we go. [Dean sips his coffee and Cas sighs, neither have any ideas] Nah. I need a real drink. I’m gonna get a beer. You wanna beer?

Castiel: No.

Dean: I’ll get a beer.

Castiel: The Angels.

Dean: What?

Castiel: Maybe Heaven could help us.

Dean: Ah, not for nothing, but don’t the angels mostly want to kill you?

Castiel: Yes. Yeah. This would be something of a Hail Mary.

Dean: Hmm.

Castiel: It’s a sports term, like slam dunk or, uh... ball handler.

Dean: That’s, uh… Mnh-mnh. No, I don’t think it's a good idea.

Castiel: Well, Dean, we don’t have any good ideas.

Dean: Okay, just... let’s just not barrel through with that like, uh, you know, like the Donatello thing.

Castiel: We had our disagreement, but we got results.

Dean: That don’t make it okay.

Castiel: I hear your concerns, and yes, the angels loathe me, and there’s going to be dangers, but Heaven doesn’t want the world to end any more than we do.

[Sam enters the kitchen with his computer]

Castiel: This is-- This is something that I have to try.

Sam: We got a problem.

Dean: Another one? Awesome.

Sam: All the stuff that Rowena said on the phone-- uh, Pacific Northwest, art gallery, party-- I-I think I found her.

[he hands the tablet to Dean who reads the Oregon Tribune article]

Dean: A rich lady exploded?

Sam: Yeah. Uh, local cops are-- are calling it spontaneous combustion. Pretty much.

Castiel: Well, that does sound like Rowena.

Dean: I knew it. I freaking knew it, man. You gave her that page. What'd you think was gonna happen, huh?

Sam: She wanted to protect herself.

Dean: Yeah, by barbecuing someone?

Sam: We don’t know what this is yet. Maybe she had a reason to--

Dean: Doesn’t matter what the reason is. That’s not okay!

Sam: Okay, I said if Rowena goes bad again I’d deal with it, so I’ll deal with it.

Dean: You better. Cas, you wanna try this angel thing, then go for it. Just don’t get dead again.


[EXTERIOR: the playground where Cas hopes to access Heaven.]

Castiel: Hello!

[from up inside the jungle gym, a man shushes Cas, and then emerges from the playhouse with a bottle of alcohol]

Castiel: Indra?

Indra: Castiel, nice blade. Uh, are we going to fight?

Cas: No, no I don’t-- I don't want to. I… I just need to get into Heaven.

Indra: Ok, who’s stopping you?

Cas: This isn’t exactly the welcome I was expecting.

Indra: Yeah, well, we’re all learning how to deal with disappointment lately. Look I could, uh... get it together to, uh... battle if you want. I mean, none of the angels are exactly thrilled with your, uh, "ongoing adventures." But personally? Meh.

[he drinks sadly from the bottle in his hand]

Cas: Is that a… are you drunk?

Indra: Well, not yet, but if I keep drinking at a pace, it starts to at least take the edge off.

Cas: Indra, this is an important responsibility. You’re guarding the gates of Heaven.

Indra: Oh, you think it’s an important responsibility? You?

[he laughs and drinks some more]

Cas Indra!

Indra: Hey, hey, between us, if you wanna just... say we fought and angel blade me right now, that’d be ok.

Cas: Is that a joke?

Indra: Is it?

Cas: Indra, what’s wrong?

Indra: See for yourself. And for what it’s worth, good luck.

[Cas steps in to the sandpit and disappears in a swirl of dust]


[INTERIOR: Heaven, the corridor leading to the throne]

Cas: Hello! Hello…hello…

[Dumah and two other angels approach Cas]

Cas: Dumah, I need to talk to you. I... I know you want to murder me, and I know that you have good reason to want to murder me. But there are events unfolding on Earth and, um… well… the archangel Gabriel, he's alive. And I need to find him before Michael, who’s... It's not our Michael. It’s another much, much worse Michael. I need to find him before that Michael invades this world to... to either subjugate or destroy it. Or both, probably in that order. And there’s also the problem of... of a missing nephilim and Lucifer. He’s back too. It’s... it's been an eventful few weeks. I realize that this may be a long shot but… [the lights dim several times before coming back on]… What is that?

Dumah: Castiel, I think, I think that maybe we could help each other.


[EXTERIOR, night, driving down the highway, crossing into Idaho. Sam and Dean try to get in touch with Rowena. Sam looks at this phone and sighs.]

Dean: Still no answer?

Sam: Yep, still no answer

Dean: You know I don’t wanna be right about this but… I mean, look, I want the fun flirty Rowena that mostly helps us, but you gotta be ready for, uh… not that.

[A woman appears in the back seat of the car]

Jessica: Or maybe she just has bad cell reception.

[Dean slams on the brakes and pulls Baby over. The boys get out of the car and confront Jessica]

Dean: What the hell??!

Sam: Who are you?

Jessica: Hi, Dean.

Dean: Wait… Jessica?

Sam: So you know her?

Dean: Yeah, she’s a reaper. She tried to take me into the light. Didn’t work out.

Jessica: It really didn’t. And honestly it’s been a little sad watching you go this long without telling Sam about me.

Sam: Hold on a second. What do you mean "watching?"

Jessica: Well, after Dean’s little trip to the Veil, Death asked me to keep an eye on you two, in case.

Dean: In case of what?

Jessica: This, I guess. I don’t ask Death questions. Never goes well.

Sam: So what, you-- you’ve just been... hovering around us, invisible, like a-- like a baby sitter?

Jessica: No, no more like a baby monitor.

Sam: And-- and you’ve seen, um...

Jessica: Oh, everything.

Dean: You mean, like, everything everything?

Jessica: I’m especially fond of Sam’s impressive… extensive array of hair products. [looks at Dean] Not to mention, the three day old bacon cheeseburger in your room, or the VHS tape hidden under your bed labeled "Sweet Princess Asuka Meets the Tentacles of Ple--"

Dean: Okay, all right, all right, that’s not cool, okay? That’s-- First of all, that’s a classic. Secondly, the burger's for emergency cases only.

Sam: Okay. Gross. Now why are you just manifesting now?

Jessica: People in Portland have been dying outside of their assigned times, because apparently someone has become powerful enough to do that.

Sam: Rowena?

Jesica: So I’ve been instructed to offer my assistance as a resource.

Dean: Wait, you said people are dying, as in more than one.

Jessica: Four. So far.

Sam: Yeah, okay, well, uh, we’re handling it.

Jessica: But if you need anything--

Sam: We don’t, and we won’t.

Jessica: Cool. Well, I’m around. Always.

[She gives Sam and Dean a knowing look and then disappears]

Dean: Okay. Well you know, we could've actually used her help.

Sam: We could... Seriously? You trust her?

Dean: No I don’t trust her. But between the-- the reapers and Death, the hell’s this witch got us into, huh?


[INTERIOR: Rowena's hotel room, sitting at a desk, looking at a photograph of young Crowley in a frame.]

Rowena: I’ve become too sentimental. That’s the problem. Whoever would've expected. [her phone rings, it's Sam calling, she doesn't answer] Oh, this won’t be fun, Bernard. The Winchesters keep calling and they won’t just give up. They’ll come here. But we won’t let anyone stop me from fixing things. I’m capable of anything now. Anything. [her eyes glow purple]


ACT 2
[EXTERIOR: Day, LaVeau Gallery. Sam and Dean arrive dressed as FBI agents and go inside to examine the scene of Elizabeth Mahler's death]

Sam: Uh, the victim’s name was Elizabeth Mahler. I'm in her e-mails right now.

Dean: Anything look like Rowena bait?

Sam: Hard to say. Um… so Mahler was the CFO of a local pharmaceutical company. Getting a lot of traction on the lo-- Oh, wow.

Dean: What?

Sam: Look at this… [Sam shows Dean the an article on his tablet] Pirodine pharmaceuticals. According to this article, they sold thousands of improperly labelled drugs.

Dean: So, what, people got sick?

Sam: People died. Uh, wow. Mahler’s lawyer got her off on a technicality.

Dean: Okay. So, what? You think she deserved it?

Sam: No, I’m done defending Rowena, okay? I'm-- I’m just reading what’s there.

Dean: Okay, I have a question. If that’s Elizabeth Mahler, [he points to a second, faint burn marn on the floor beside Elizabeth's ashes] who the hell is that?

Sam: I don't know. Article only mentioned one person. Wait a second. I’ve seen something like that before. [he searches on his tablet] No way. That is what’s left of a reaper. [he shows Dean an image on the internet]

Dean: I have an idea… come on.


[EXTERIOR: Art gallery, Sam follows Dean outside]

Sam: What?

Dean: Yo! Jessica!

Jessica: Hi.

Sam: Hi. So, uh, that dead reaper in there, is that why you’re all of a sudden so interested in helping?

Jessica: I’m glad you’re ready to chat now. This will be a positive experience.

Dean: Okay, you can drop the whole warm and fuzzy thing.

Jessica: That’s just a useful affect. I’m still an instrument of death.

Sam: You know, you could have told us Rowena was killing reapers.

Jessica: And I would have, but you were "handling it."

Dean: Okay, all right. Talk.

Jessica: Rowena’s changing people’s fates. She’s killing them before their time and when a reaper shows…

Sam: She torches them, too.

Jessica: Yes.

Dean: Why?

Jessica: You’ll have to ask her when you stop her. Because if she keeps this up, she's going to throw off fate. The whole greater machinery of death.

Sam: That means...

Jessica: Have you ever heard of the butterfly effect?

Dean: Ashton’s second best movie.

Sam {looks at Dean, incredulous}: Yes, of course. Uh, uh, one small mistake can-- can cause all kinds of bad. What about it?

Jessica: If just one person dies before their time, a lot of things that were supposed to happen, don’t. The ripple effect from just one early death can affect hundreds of lives. And changing their fates changes even more fates until things just become sincerely unfortunate, and we have to hit the reset button.

Sam: What does that mean?

Jessica: Usually? A mass kill off. Like the Black Plague or a mid-sized war. Something to wipe the board clean. So… your help in avoiding that would be greatly appreciated, by everyone.

Dean: If it’s so bad, why don’t you stop her?

Jessica: You've met Billie, right? She's got rules. Clean hands. No interference. Well, no direct interference, anyway. We can't stop her, but you can. [she looks directly at Sam]

Sam: What, me?

Jessica: Death keeps notebooks with all the ways a person might die, depending on their choices. Dean’s seen his.

Dean: I gotta whole shelf.

Jessica: But in Rowena MacLeod's notebook, her death is always the same -- She's killed, Sam Winchester, by you.


[INTERIOR: Heaven's throne room. Cas is bored waiting and the lights repeatedly dim and brighten. Eventually, Dumah enters]

Dumah: Sorry to keep you waiting.

Cas: It’s fine. Actually, it’s-- it's not fine, because all of creation is at stake, but here we are.

Dumah: Yes, well… There’s a lot going on.

Cas: Yeah, I noticed. Dumah, what did you mean that we could help each other?

Dumah: Find Gabriel and bring him back to us, back home, and we can help you with everything else--battling Michael, defending Earth.

Cas: I can’t find him… That’s why I need your help.

Dumah: Right. Well, then, that’s a problem

Cas: I don’t understand. Can’t you find a few angels to--

[Naomi enters]

Naomi: That’s enough, Castiel.

[Flashback to Naomi torturing Cas, and her death in 8.23]

Naomi: It’s not that we won’t help you. It’s that we can’t.


[INTERIOR: Baby. Night. the boys discuss the case]

Sam: Okay, it definitely looks like she’s working her way through these Pirodine pharmaceutical people.

Dean: Have any idea who’s next?

Sam: No, I mean everyone mentioned in the articles is already dead. Wait a second. Except for James Melford, the, uh, CEO.

Dean: Alright, what do we know about him?

Jessica [appears in the back seat again]: He’s dying.

Dean: Stop doing that!

Sam: What do you mean he-- he's--

Jessica: James Melford's already bound for hell, but his time of death just shifted.

Sam: To when?

Jessica: Now.


[cut to James Melford bleeding to death on the ground, writhing in agony]

Rowena: This is a lovely backyard, but you really shouldn't have tried to run, James.

James [begging for his life]: Please…

Rowena [bending down near him]: After what you’ve done to so many sick people all over this country, letting them suffer and taking their money? You should consider this death a blessing, because you’re finally helping someone else.

James: Who?

Rowena: Shh. Wait for it. [her eyes glow purple as she looks around] Ah, there he is.

[a reaper appears]

Reaper: You can see me?

Rowena: Aye. Do you have a message for me from your boss? One quick chat, and all of this will end.

Reaper: Death doesn’t negotiate with witches.

Rowena: We'll see. Mors lumena!

[James and the reaper both scream as they combust]


ACT 3
[EXTERIOR, night. Sam and Dean are at the site of Melford’s death, examining the ashes]

Dean: Well, so much for James Melford.

Jessica: And Martin. His reaper. His name was Martin.

[Sam's phone rings]

Sam: Here we go. Rowena.

[intercut scenes with Rowena from her hotel room]

Rowena: I don’t suppose there’s any way you’ll simply leave me to my business before something unfortunate happens?

Sam: Oh, you’re starting off with a threat. Nice.

Rowena: I would never. But this doesn’t involve you boys.

Dean: You’re killing people. It involves us.

Rowena: Mm, if you’d let me explain…

Sam: You think this is something you can just explain away? I trusted you.

Rowena: I know that, Sam. I’d just rather not talk about this over the phone. I’ll text you an address. Meet me there in half an hour.

Dean: And then what?

Rowena: You believe me or you don’t. Either way the drinks are on me.

[she hangs up]

Dean: I don’t like it. I mean, what’s the over/under this is a trap?

Sam: Well, it’s Rowena. Of course it’s a trap.


[INTERIOR: Rowena’s hotel room]

Rowena: Once we’re face to face, I’ll convince them to stop or we’ll stop them. Are you ready, Bernard?

[she puts several hex bags in her purse]


[INTERIOR: Naomi's office in Heaven]

Cas: How are you alive?

Naomi: A drill in the head wasn’t going to kill me. You should know that.

Cas: You know, I have to admit I was... I was relieved to hear you were dead.

Naomi: We never did see eye to eye.

Cas: No, no we didn’t, because you stole my memories, and you threatened to "tear me apart," and you made me repeatedly act out Dean Winchester’s murder, and you killed many, many people.

Naomi: Those were simpler times.

Cas: "I’m sorry" goes a long way.

Naomi: Mm-hmm. After Metatron attacked, I had a few reliable angels spread the word that I was dead.

Cas: So you’ve been hiding?

Naomi: Recovering.

Cas: All this time?

Naomi: Well, forgive me for taking a few years to put my thoughts back in my skull. There’s still a few holes-- pardon the phrasing-- but I’m mostly here. I have to be. [the lights fluctuate] Do you know what powers Heaven, Castiel?

Cas Yeah, us. Angels.

Naomi: That's right. We're all... Every angel is like a walking, talking battery. [the lights fluctuate again] And that is what happens when we run out of power.

Cas: I don’t understand.

Naomi: Well, then, let me make it divinely simple for you. There are a grand total of nine angels in Heaven, present company included, and one or two on Earth, and... that's all. We are the last men and women and divine waves of light still standing, as it were.

Cas: No, that’s, uh… That’s not, um… I knew our numbers were small…

Naomi: You wanna know why we can’t help you? Because none of us can leave. We’re the only things keeping the lights on. [lights dim again] Barely. We need everyone, especially an archangel. Now the others thought any archangel would do, Long story. But your news about Gabriel is… for lack of a better word, blessed. With his power we can keep heaven running.

Cas: And without him?

Naomi: Without him, in time we’ll burn out. Heaven will crumble, and all the souls that have been entrusted to our care will fall back to earth. Picture it, Castiel-- billions upon billions of ghosts unleashed upon the world. All that chaos, all that death.


[INTERIOR, hotel bar. Rowena and Bernard enter. Sam and Dean are seated at a table.]

Dean: Heads up.

Rowena: Boys.

Dean [gesturing towards Bernard, waiting for Rowena at the bar]: What’s with the goon?

Rowena: Just a precaution. We’re all wary, aren’t we? Surely you’ve got your witch killing bullets handy?

Sam: Rowena, this isn't why I helped you.Were you just playing the whole time?

Rowena: Of course not. But once I unlocked my power, I couldn’t just hide away. I realized I can right some wrongs that are long overdue.

Dean: By killing innocents?

Rowena: Innocents?! These drug company people, they lied about their product for money-- money they used to avoid the law. They’ve hurt thousands of sick people, which makes them far worse than most of the monsters you’ve killed. I’m striking a blow for justice.

Sam: Yeah, then why are you killing reapers?

Rowena: Well... they’re just a means to an end. It’s not easy to get Death’s attention.

Dean: Well, trust me, that’s not the kind of attention you want.

Rowena: Oh, but it is. Death has something I want.

Sam: What’s that?

Rowena: My son. After you told me he was gone, how he died, I had an unexpected reaction. We had our differences, but it’s my fault he went down the path he did. I left him.

Dean: We’re talking about Crowley-- demon, King of Hell?

Rowena: We’re talking about Fergus-- a man abandoned and loveless, tricked by a demon, died in a gutter. He deserved better from the world. From me.

Dean: Well, Crowley’s dead. There’s no coming back from that.

Rowena: Oh, is that so, Dean? Are only Winchesters allowed to come back from the dead? The rest of us just have to accept it? I don’t think so. I’m putting death on notice.

Sam: All right. Well, she’s taken notice.

Rowena: She? Interesting.

Dean: And she’s upset. But you can quit this before--

Rowena: I’m not afraid and as much as I enjoy our little talks, you can’t stop me.

Sam: Actually, we can.

Rowena: And what makes you think that?

Dean: Because every version of your death, your real, permanent death, Sam's the one who kills you.

Rowena: I see.

Sam: Yeah, but it’s not gonna happen tonight.

[As Sam leans towards Rowena with the warded handcuffs she disappears in a pall of purple haze.]

Rowena: I hope you don’t mind astral projection? Safety first, boys.

[Rowena and Bernard escape down a hotel corridor. Sam chases after her]

Sam: Rowena! Hey Rowena! Hey!

[Dean, also giving chase, runs into Bernard’s forearm and a furious fight ensues between the two of them.]

Dean: You know she’s controlling your brain.

Bernard: She’s powerful, she’s gorgeous, and she’s paying me a small fortune. That woman didn’t have to cast a spell on me.

[Dean launches himself at Bernard and the fight resumes]


[Rowena runs out to the alley, followed by Sam, and he aims a gun at her]

Sam: Rowena, stop! Stay right there. Listen to me. I get what you’re trying to do for Crowley, but you’re messing with the machinery of the universe. Death won’t give you what you want. You have to stop.

Rowena: I can’t stop, Samuel. You’ll have to shoot me.

[she turns to face him and Sam, conflicted, eventually shoots. Rowena stops the bullet in mid-air with her hand, eyes glowing purple and the bullet falls to the ground]

Sam: H-h-how?

Rowena: You really would have shot me? Somnia. [Sam falls to the ground, unconscious]


[Bernard and Dean continue to slug it out. Jessica is present.]

Jessica: You're doing really well, but you need to hurry.

Dean {through gritted teeth}: A little help would be nice!

Jessica: Can’t… Clean hands.

[Dean eventually gets the better of Bernard, strangling him.]

Jessica: He was a highly trained military operative. It’s impressive that you could…

Dean: Sam! [he races off to find Sam. He sees Sam’s gun on the ground in the alley, but not Sam. Jessica appears]: Where the hell is my brother?!


ACT 4
[INTERIOR, Rowena’s hotel room. Sam is awake but immobilised in a chair.]

Rowena: Don’t struggle. It'll only make things worse.

Sam: Rowena, you gotta listen to me. This power’s going to your head, okay? It’s making you go crazy.

Rowena: No, it’s given me clarity. It’s shown me that everything I did before for wealth, for magic, for myself, meant nothing. And it took everything from me, everyone I loved-- my family, Oskar, my son. I’m a flawed, petty, evil creature, Samuel, and I don’t know if I can be redeemed, but I have to try. And I do wish there was another way.

Sam: You…wh… what are you saying?

Rowena: Well, you said it yourself. There’s only one way to stop me-- you. But if you’re dead, well... then, I can’t be stopped, can I? Death will have to grant me an audience.

[Rowena rips open Sam’s shirt]

Sam: Oh, no, you-- you-- you don’t know that!

Rowena: True, but there’s only one way to find out. [She cuts her hand]

Sam: What are you doing? What is that? [Rowena pours liquid onto her palm]

Rowena You don’t wanna know.

Sam: Rowena, don’t do this. You don’t have to do this.

Rowena: What haven’t you done for your family? What wouldn’t you do? I’m sorry, Sam.

[she thrusts her hand onto his tattoo and he screams. Death appears.]

Death: Hello, Rowena.

Rowena: You? I know you.

Death: We met when I was a reaper.

Rowena: We totally did. If we’d just exchanged numbers, none of this would have been necessary.

Death: You’re upsetting the natural order. That’s... unwise.

Rowena: Bring back my son, and it all stops. Say no, and I’ll--

Death: No.

Rowena: Then I’ll kill Sam Winchester. That’ll really frog up your natural order, won’t it?

Death: Go ahead.

[Sam struggles and grunts, clearly disapproving of this course of events]

Rowena: What?

Death: I don’t think it’s a good thing. And I don’t believe any of us will like what comes next, but I don’t do blackmail so… Go ahead.

{Rowena, knife in hand, turns to a frightened and struggling Sam}

Death: I’m curious to see what happens.

Sam: No. No, no, no no no. No. Rowena. I know what you went through and I know how much you lost and I realize how much you want your family back. But don’t do this. This... this... This is not you. Not any more.

Rowena: What happened to me, those were my choices. But Fergus never… It wasn’t fair. [Rowena turns towards death and screams] It's not fair! [Rowena blasts Death with purple light, which has no effect, and falls to her knees]

Death: You were never going to kill him. There was a time you would've, but not now.

[Death kneels in front of Rowena and raises her head tenderly]

Death: I can see that.

Rowena [crying]: I don’t know what I’m doing.

Death: Sometimes life is unfair, and sometimes we lose things. And sometimes we make mistakes. And some of these things can never be fixed, no matter how powerful you become. Some things just are, and everyone has to live with that.

Rowena [sobbing]: And now you’ll take me?

Death: No, you already know how your story ends. [Death looks at Sam]

[Dean crashes through the door, bloody and bruised]

Dean: Sam.

Sam: Dean!

Death: Hey, Dean. See you again soon. [Death disappears]


ACT 5
[Exterior, day. At the Heaven portal playground]

Naomi: If you find Gabriel, tell him what’s happening in Heaven.

Cas: And if I can’t find him?

Naomi: We’ll do our duty… keep things running.

Cas: For how long?

Naomi: Ah, that’s the scary part.

Cas: We will find a way to fix this. We will.

Naomi: This may be one of those things that can’t be fixed, Castiel.

Cas: This is Heaven we are talking about.

Naomi: Everything ends, Castiel.

Cas: Everything ends.

Naomi: But until then, the gates of Heaven are closed.

[Naomi returns to Heaven, leaving Cas alone and forlorn in the playground]


[INTERIOR: Rowena’s hotel room. Sam, Dean and Rowena are all sitting on the floor, drinking]

Sam: How you feelin?

Dean: Like I got punched in the face. A lot.

Sam: Huh.

Rowena: Yes, about that… Bernard’s very enthusiastic.

Dean: Yeah, that’s one word for it.

Sam {to Rowena}: And what about you? How are you feeling?

Rowena: I fought Death and lost. I feel tired. Weaker. I don’t know if it’s forever. Sam, what have I done?

Sam: You had a chance to kill me and you didn’t. I’d call that progress.

Dean: I’d call that a miracle. [Dean and Rowena exchange looks]

Sam: You know, what happened with Crowley? That wasn’t your fault.

Rowena: He never had a chance.

Dean: He made his choices, just like we all do. Look, every one of us has done something that we have to live with, that were trying to make up for. Every one of us.

Sam: Even without all that extra juice, you’re still the deadliest witch around.

Rowena: Flatterer.

Sam: Yeah, well, we, um... we may need your help. To save our family. To… hell, to save the world.

Dean: You wanna be redeemed? This would be a pretty big step.

Rowena: And do you think I still can be?

Deanv Yeah, I do.

Sam: We both do. But before you answer, you gotta know something. Um... Lucifer is back.

Rowena: Mm. Of course he is.

Dean: Now you’re not gonna…
