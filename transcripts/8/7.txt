NOW
EXT. RANDY RACCOON PRE-SCHOOL – DAY


Children play in a playground. A BOY finger-paints at an outdoor table.


YOUNG WOMAN
It's finger painting, Aaron, not body painting. Let's get you cleaned up.


The YOUNG WOMAN walks with the BOY to an outdoor toilet block and holds the door of the boys’ room open for him.


YOUNG WOMAN
There you go.


The YOUNG WOMAN's eyes change to black as she looks around before following the BOY inside and closing the door. Bright light shines around the door frame and dark clouds appear in the sky. Strong wind blows through the playground. The bright light behind the door of the boys’ room goes out and the door partly opens and then closes again. Children scream and run for cover. The door of the boys’ room partly opens and then closes again. A twister appears in the playground and fierce wind knocks over easels and chairs. The door of the boys’ room blows open. No one is inside.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. FOREST ROAD – DAY


The Animals’ “We Gotta Get Out of This Place” plays.


♪ We got to get out of this place ♪


The IMPALA drives down the road.


♪ If it's the last thing we ever do ♪

♪ We got to get out of this place ♪


DEAN is driving while eating a bag of potato chips.


♪ Girl, there's a better life for me and you ♪


♪ mm, yeah ♪


A man in a trenchcoat is walking along the road.


♪ My little girl, you're so young and pretty ♪


As DEAN overtakes the man, we see that it is CASTIEL, who has a beard and is wearing pajamas underneath the trenchcoat.


♪ and one thing I know ♪


DEAN turns around to look at CASTIEL and brakes. He looks in the rear vision mirror as he stops the car, then reverses down the road. He leaves the car running on the road next to a sign for the Twin Pines Resort, gets out and looks around. There is no sign of CASTIEL.


INT. CABIN – DAY


SAM is using the laptop and drinking a beer.


SAM
Hey.


DEAN
Hey.


DEAN stands in the middle of the room holding a six-pack and a paper bag.


SAM
You look like you've s– well, I was gonna say, "You look like you've seen a ghost," but you'd probably be stoked. Uh, you okay?


DEAN
[somewhat uncertainly] Yeah, I'm cool. What's up?


SAM
Well, this kid went missing from a preschool.


DEAN
That sucks. And?


SAM
And at the same time he vanished, a surprise tornado hit, lasted maybe 20 seconds, then, uh... shazam! Back to perfect weather.


DEAN
Hmm. And they pooh-pooh climate change.


SAM
[chuckling] Yeah.


DEAN puts the beer into the fridge.


SAM
Well, similar wackiness has happened over the past few weeks in other places – uh, Tulsa, a bus driver vanishes and a river gets overrun with frogs. New Mexico – a mailman disappears, the earth splits open.


DEAN
All right. So, uh, you thinking demons?


DEAN walks over to stand next to SAM and looks at the laptop.


SAM
Yeah, possibly, but... I mean, this stuff was major. [The laptop screen shows articles about missing persons.] These folks have nothing in common – no religious affiliations, different hometowns, all ages. Why would demons want them?


DEAN
Why do demons want anything? [He slaps SAM lightly on the shoulder.] Uh, so, we on this?


SAM
Yep.


INT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


Screams come from behind a closed door. CROWLEY is torturing SAMANDIRIEL with an angel-killing knife.


SAMANDIRIEL
What do you want?! I've given you all the names.


CROWLEY
No. No. No. And no. That's not what I want to hear. [He cuts SAMANDIRIEL again and SAMANDIRIEL screams.] This hurts you more than it hurts me, so I can go on forever. Which, in your case, forever means... well, forever.


SAMANDIRIEL
When the angels find out what you're doing...


CROWLEY
They'll be what – put out? I'm quaking, really. The power grid is so whacked out in Heaven, they don't even know you're not there. So, on the count of thee... one, two... [He plunges the knife into SAMANDIRIEL, who screams.]


SAMANDIRIEL
What happened to three?


CROWLEY
I lied. I do that. Just give me the other names.


SAMANDIRIEL
There are no other names! The next generation isn't born yet.


CROWLEY
Truth?


SAMANDIRIEL
Truth.


CROWLEY
Well, I suppose there's no reason to keep torturing you, then. [He plunges the knife into SAMANDIRIEL again.] Sorry. Once you get going, it's really hard to stop.


CROWLEY puts down the knife and takes off the apron he is wearing.


CROWLEY
[to a DEMON standing next to the door] Keep him on ice. We've only just scratched the surface with this one.


CUT TO:


AARON, the boy who was finger-painting in the playground, runs away as CROWLEY enters the room.


CROWLEY
I hope the ruckus down the hall wasn't too off-putting. [He walks to an octagonal table, around which six people are sitting, and sets a stone tablet on the table.] Construction standards aren't what they were during the Inquisition. [The six people are silent.] I see. No niceties. All right, then. I suppose you're wondering why I convened this motley group.


INT. ABANDONED BAR – DAY


KEVIN enters. Water pours down on him from above, breaking a salt line.


KEVIN
Mom! You've got to stop drowning me in holy water every time I go out!


MRS TRAN stands up from behind the bar. She is holding a cord. KEVIN fixes the salt line.


KEVIN
I'm not possessed!


MRS TRAN
Not yet. Not now. They got to me, remember?


KEVIN
We've got hex bags that make us invisible to demons. We've got demon traps painted everywhere! I've got a sigil tattooed on my arm! If we just keep moving, we'll be fine! [He puts a plastic bag down on the counter.]


MRS TRAN
What, and keep living in rat-infested hovels and running from cursed creatures? This is no life!


KEVIN
It's my life. I'm the one dragging the prophet load. I'm sorry I pulled you into it.


MRS TRAN
Don't be sorry. Be ready. We've got to stop running and start taking a stand. [She unpacks food from the plastic bag.]


KEVIN
Okay, you know that's crazy.


MRS TRAN
No, it's not! Not if we have the bomb you used on Crowley's demons.


KEVIN
The thing I made had ingredients from all over the world. All right? Demons had to get the stuff.


MRS TRAN
That's why I went to an expert.


KEVIN
What? Who?


MRS TRAN
I hired a witch.


KEVIN
A witch?


MRS TRAN
Off of Craigslist. Her name is Delta Mendota, and she is a smart cookie. She's scrappy, reliable, and she's willing to kill. Look, I'm your mother, and I did this for you.


KEVIN
What makes you think you can trust her?


MRS TRAN
I don't. That's why I didn't give her the exact quantities or tell her how to blend them. She's in the dark.


KEVIN
You told her we were making demon bombs!


MRS TRAN
Yeah, and that got her super motivated. Oh! Time for Delta to check in.


KEVIN
Oh, my God.


MRS TRAN opens a laptop. A message says “Connecting to Delta Mendota...” DELTA appears on the screen.


DELTA
Hi, Mrs. Tran. Is that your son? Hi, Kevin.


MRS TRAN
Hi, Delta. Bring us up to speed. You've got all the stuff?


DELTA
Almost. I don't suppose you'd tell me the recipe for these bombs?


MRS TRAN
You know the rules. Casual encounters. That means no questions asked.


KEVIN
No, Mom, that's another part of Craigslist. How long have you been a witch?


DELTA
A full witch? Since the band broke up.


KEVIN
You were in a band?


DELTA
Look, guys. I take my witch business real serious. I'm on it, and it's gonna be wicked awesome. Okay?


MRS TRAN smiles brightly.


EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN in their FBI suits walk up the steps to the front door. SAM knocks. The YOUNG WOMAN from the playground appears in the entryway. SAM holds up his FBI badge so she can see it through the glass pane in the door. The YOUNG WOMAN opens the door, but doesn’t undo the chain.


DEAN
Mrs. Hagar? Agents Roth and Malloy. We want to speak to you about Aaron Webber's abduction.


MRS HAGAR
Like I told the police, one minute I was taking Aaron to get cleaned up, and the next minute... I woke up in a park three blocks away.


SAM
And you have no memory of what happened?


MRS HAGAR
No. He was just gone.


DEAN
Can you think any reason why somebody would want to harm him? Um, any enemies?


MRS HAGAR
Enemies? He's five.


SAM
[speaking quietly into his phone] Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus...


MRS HAGAR
Excuse me?


DEAN
It's, uh, code for your own safety so that you can't reveal anything under enhanced interrogation. Now, when you woke up on the floor, were there any signs of struggle?


MRS HAGAR
No.


SAM
Smell like sulfur?


MRS HAGAR
How did you know that?


SAM
Lucky guess. Thanks for your time.


MRS HAGAR closes the door and SAM and DEAN walk down the steps.


DEAN
No reaction to the exorcism.


SAM
Yeah, not possessed at the moment. But I'm willing to bet a demon got ahold of Aaron Webber.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


SAM is asleep in bed. DEAN is sitting on the other bed reading articles about the missing persons on the laptop. Lightning flashes. DEAN looks up to see CASTIEL standing at the window.


ACT TWO
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


DEAN closes the laptop and walks to the window. No one is there. SAM wakes.


SAM
Dean? What's going on? Are you all right? [He throws back the covers and sits on the edge of the bed.]


DEAN
I don't know. I just saw something.


SAM
Uh, you saw what? [He stands up and walks over to DEAN.]


DEAN
Cas.


SAM
Cas? Where?


DEAN
Right there. And – and – and earlier, on the road. I feel like I'm seeing him.


SAM
That's... not possible. I mean, you said it yourself. You made it out and he didn't, right?


DEAN
I tried so damn hard to get us the hell out of there. [He turns away from the window and walks a few steps away.]


SAM
I know you did.


DEAN
[with his back to SAM] You know, I could have pulled him out. I just don't understand why he didn't try harder.


SAM
Dean. [He walks over to DEAN, who turns to face him.] You did everything you could.


DEAN
Yeah, but why do I feel like crap?


SAM
Survivor's guilt?


DEAN
Hmm.


SAM
If you let it, this is gonna keep messing with you. You got to walk past it.


SAM claps DEAN on the shoulder and walks to the bathroom.


FLASHBACK – PURGATORY


BENNY, DEAN and CASTIEL are walking through the forest.


BENNY
We're getting close.


DEAN
Really? I don't see crap. I mean, what the hell is this escape hatch supposed to look like?


CASTIEL
He doesn't know.


DEAN
Hey, you just drug me into the fire. Please tell me you know.


BENNY
It's here. They promised.


DEAN
Oh, they? Well, that's comforting.


CASTIEL
Well, even if it does exist...


BENNY
Broken record, Cas.


CASTIEL
Dean, it's a human portal. There's still no proof that an angel can pass –


DEAN
Stow it, Cas. You're coming. That's final.


CASTIEL
I'm just saying... [He puts a hand on DEAN’s shoulder. DEAN stops and looks at him.] ...if it doesn't work... thank you for everything.


DEAN
Save the Hallmark. Okay? It's gonna work. Nobody gets left behind.


DEAN walks off and CASTIEL follows him.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


DEAN is still standing where he was prior to the flashback. We see a close-up of his face.


INT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


CROWLEY addresses the six people who are sitting around the octagonal table.


CROWLEY
Hope you enjoyed our orange juice and pancakes. Best to pack in those carbs in the morning, you know.


JUSTIN HURST (man from first missing persons article)
Are we on a spaceship?


CROWLEY
Sorry?


WOMAN
Snapping us up from our homes, our families, teleporting us to this m-mother ship.


CROWLEY
Mother ship?


JUSTIN HURST
You're aliens, right?


CROWLEY
Possibly a long shot. [He holds up the stone tablet.] Does this mean anything to you?


JUSTIN HURST
I don't read Chinese.


CROWLEY
Talk about the dumbing down of America. Anyone? Come on. It's fun. Give it a go. You hapless toads are utterly clueless, aren't you?


DENNIS ADAMS (man from second missing persons article)
I-I-I got a wife and kids. I-I got bills. I can't miss work.


CROWLEY
Sir.


DENNIS ADAMS
I got rights! Where's my one phone call?


CROWLEY makes a hand motion and DENNIS ADAMS doubles over. Blood runs from his mouth. He slides to the floor against a wall.


CROWLEY
Anyone else want to complain? Hmm?


WOMAN
Um... [She stands up and picks up the stone tablet.] We hold this... Um, maybe "these" ...truths to be...


CROWLEY turns the stone table 90 degrees.


WOMAN
Oh. [She smiles and laughs.] Oh, right. That's – that's better, yeah.


INT. ABANDONED BAR – DAY


KEVIN opens the door and DELTA enters.


DELTA
Hi. Kevin, right? [KEVIN nods.] Hmm. So, I was – ohh! [MRS TRAN squirts DELTA in the face with holy water.] What the hell?


KEVIN
And my mother, you've met. [He hands DELTA a towel.]


DELTA
Yeah.


MRS TRAN
You have everything?


DELTA
You bet. [She hands MRS TRAN a bag.] It was a bitch, but so worth it. Honestly, I am sick of being treated like dirt by those demons. Like, who died and made them boss? [MRS TRAN takes spell ingredients out of the bag.] Well, probably somebody did. But they could use a serious attitude reduction. Kev, where's the ladies room? Long drive, and, you know...


KEVIN
Over there.


DELTA
Cool.


MRS TRAN
Delta, what is this?! I was clear. I need to build an arsenal. This maybe gets me one weapon!


DELTA
It's just a little taste of what you'll get when I get paid in full.


MRS TRAN
That was not the agreement!


DELTA
It is now.


DELTA walks towards the bathroom. KEVIN watches her go. She is wearing a short skirt.


MRS TRAN
Kevin! Forget it!


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


SAM is using the laptop.


SAM
Hey, so it's not just Americans who are vanishing. Uh, this guy, Luigi Ponzi disappeared walking between two subway cars in Rome. And right above ground, there was a freak hail storm.


DEAN
[washing his face in the bathroom] So, we going to Rome? Wouldn't be too shabby.


CASTIEL appears in the mirror in the bathroom. DEAN straightens up, sees CASTIEL in the mirror and turns around.


CASTIEL
Hello, Dean.


CUT TO:


SAM and CASTIEL are sitting at the table. DEAN leans on the kitchenette counter.


SAM
Unbelievable, man. I-I cannot believe it. You're actually here.


CASTIEL
Yeah, I've been trying to reach out, but for whatever reason, I wasn't at full power. So I couldn't connect with you.


SAM
That must have been why you kept seeing him. I mean, you think?


DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, uh, I got to be honest. I-I-I'm thinking, how the hell did you make it out? I mean, I – I was there. I-I-I know that place. I know how we had to scratch and claw and kill and bleed to find that portal and make it through it, and it almost finished me. So, uh... so how exactly are you sitting here with us right now?


CASTIEL
Dean, everything you just said is completely true. And that's the strange part. I... have no idea. I remember endlessly running and hiding from Leviathan, and then I was on the side of the road in Illinois. And... that was it.


DEAN
And that – that was it?


CASTIEL
Yes. [There is a long pause.] Oh. I'm dirty.


DEAN
Yeah, well, Purgatory will do that to you.


CASTIEL walks towards the bathroom. The camera focuses on DEAN’s face.


FLASHBACK – PURGATORY


BENNY, CASTIEL and DEAN are walking through the forest.


CASTIEL
Maybe you were lied to. Maybe there is no seam.


BENNY
I lie. I don't get lied to. Aren't you guys all about faith?


CASTIEL
Not particularly.


They watch a leaf which seems to be borne upwards by an air current. At the top of a cliff far above them, a patch of blue light shimmers and changes shape.


BENNY
Oh, ye of frigging little faith.


DEAN
What the hell?


CASTIEL
There it is. [to DEAN] It's reacting to you.


BENNY nods to DEAN.


BENNY
All right. Ready?


DEAN
Just like we talked about. [DEAN cuts his left forearm with a large knife.]


BENNY
Putting a lot of trust in you, brother.


DEAN
You earned it. [He cuts BENNY’s left forearm and they grip each other’s left arms with their left hands.]


BENNY
I'll see you on the other side.


DEAN
Conjunti sumus, unum sumus.


BENNY looks upwards as his body stiffens. His left hand, which grips DEAN’s arm, glows with red and white light. BENNY then appears to be consumed by red and white light that flows into DEAN’s arm. DEAN grimaces.


DEAN
Let's go.


CUT TO:


DEAN and CASTIEL hurry along the top of a cliff and upwards through the forest.


CASTIEL
Dean, wait.


Something hits the ground in clouds of black smoke in front of them. As the smoke clears, two balls of black goo become LEVIATHANS.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


SAM
Dean?


DEAN
Huh?


SAM
You all right?


DEAN
You do see something... [he sits down at the table opposite SAM] ...severely wrong here, right? Sammy, I remember every second of leaving that place. I mean, I remember the – the heat, the stink, the pain, the fear. I have that whole ugly mess... [he taps his head] ...right here, and he says he has no idea how he got out? I – I'm just not buying it.


SAM
So what, you think he's lying?


DEAN
I'm saying something else happened. I saw the shape that he was in. I mean, there was no way he was fighting his ass out alone. No way.


SAM
All right. So, who... or what got him out?


DEAN
Exactly.


CASTIEL walks out of the bathroom. He is now wearing a suit and tie under the trenchcoat, which is clean, and is freshly shaved. DEAN and SAM turn to him and straighten up in their seats.


CASTIEL
Better? [He spreads his arms wide, asking for their opinion.]

SAM smiles at CASTIEL and turns to DEAN. DEAN glances at SAM, then turns to CASTIEL, gives a half smile and nods.

ACT THREE
INT. ABANDONED BAR – DAY


MRS TRAN
Listen, you little skank. In the service industry, you always deliver the goods, then you get paid. Even hookers know that.


DELTA
Hmm. Says you. See, my sister's a hooker. So hookers get paid first, and then you get the goods. Look, I'm not the one with demons on my ass. You want to renege on our deal, it's fine by me.


MRS TRAN
Kevin, bring me my purse. [KEVIN walks off.] Your mother must be so proud.


DELTA
She is. Of course, with my sister, the bar ain't real high.


KEVIN opens a door and walks into another room. The salt line along the windowsill is broken. He hurries back to MRS TRAN.


KEVIN
Mom! Did you break the salt line by the store-room window?


MRS TRAN
What?! Of course not!


CROWLEY clears his throat and KEVIN turns. Beside CROWLEY is another DEMON.


CROWLEY
I wouldn't bother, Kevin. There's no rush. Hello, Delta.


DELTA
Hiya.


MRS TRAN
You betrayed us?


KEVIN
How could you?


DELTA
I'm mercurial.


CROWLEY
I'm afraid Delta found you to be a difficult and ungrateful employer, Mrs. Tran. She felt she'd gain far more leverage by negotiating with me. I am, after all, the King of Hell. And you are a mom.


DELTA
I did good, didn't I, your majesty?


CROWLEY
Yes, very. [He snaps his fingers and DELTA disappears.] Presumptuous twit.


MRS TRAN
Please. Take me. Leave my son alone.


CROWLEY
You? What would I do with you? [to the DEMON] Kill her. Destroy the makings for the spell.


KEVIN
No!


CROWLEY
Yes. Say goodbye to Mommy.


CROWLEY snaps his fingers again. He and KEVIN disappear, leaving MRS TRAN and the DEMON alone in the room. MRS TRAN grabs a Super-Soaker and sprays the DEMON with holy water. He screams as his skin burns.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


CASTIEL is watching television. SAM is using the laptop at the table. DEAN enters, carrying a six-pack of beer.


DEAN
What's the latest?


SAM
The latest is... nothing. It's like it all stopped. No freak disappearances linked to any freak natural events.


DEAN sets a beer down on the table for SAM and leans over SAM’s shoulder to look at the laptop.


DEAN
So how many have we got, seven?


SAM
Yeah, uh, Luigi, Justin, Aaron, Maria –


CASTIEL
Maria, Dennis, Krista, Sven. [DEAN and SAM look at him.] I missed television.


SAM
Wait, Cas. How did you know those are the names?


CASTIEL
Well, they're prophets.


DEAN
Prophets?


CASTIEL
Yeah, angels instinctively know the names of every prophet – past, present, and future.


DEAN
So this list is the name of every one of 'em that exists?


CASTIEL
Yes, until the next generation is born. Plus Kevin Tran, of course. The other seven are future prophets, since, uh, only one can exist at a time.


SAM
Uh, how is Kevin a prophet if Chuck is a prophet?


CASTIEL
I'm not sure what happened to Chuck, but, um... he must be dead.


DEAN
So, the next one comes off the bench if Kevin goes down?


CASTIEL
Exactly. And they have no idea who they are, of course.


SAM
Crowley.


DEAN
Insurance. Boy, he's getting desperate.


SAM
Explains all the weird phenomena. Lower-level demons nabbing heavy-duty cargo. The vessels of God's Word – boom.


CASTIEL
I get the feeling something's going on.


SAM’s phone rings.


SAM (on phone)
Hello. Mrs. Tran? Well, where the hell have you... What? [He stands up and takes the phone away from his ear.] Crowley's got Kevin.


INT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


KEVIN is sitting at the octagonal table with the stone tablet in front of him.


CROWLEY
So, Kevin, as you can see, our relationship is much simpler now. You either help me, or you die and one of these fine specimens takes your place. I don't quite understand your hesitation.


KEVIN
You just killed my mother.


CROWLEY
Very unfortunate. But to be fair, she was plotting to kill me and my kind. Kevin. Kev. I can do a great deal for a plucky lad like you.


KEVIN
You'll just kill me as soon as I read the tablet.


CROWLEY
Are all young people so horribly cynical? It depresses me, Kevin. Here's the thing. I really want you to read the tablet because, frankly, this lot fail to inspire. However, better a stupid prophet than a stubborn prophet, as the saying goes. So what's it gonna be? Perhaps you doubt that I'm serious?


CROWLEY makes a hand motion and one of the women at the table floats up into the air, gasping. CROWLEY snaps his fingers. KEVIN and the others around the table gasp as they are splattered with the woman’s blood. CROWLEY takes out a handkerchief that is monogrammed with the letter “C” and dabs his mouth.


CROWLEY
So... read any good tablets lately?


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT


DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL are sitting in the IMPALA, which is parked by the side of a road.


DEAN
Where the hell is she?


SAM
She'll be here. Uh, mile marker 96 was kind of the halfway point.


The camera focuses on DEAN’s face.


FLASHBACK – PURGATORY


The portal shimmers with moving blue light. DEAN swings at the first LEVIATHAN, who ducks and hurls him to the ground. DEAN rolls downhill. CASTIEL attempts to put a hand on the LEVIATHAN’s head, but the SECOND LEVIATHAN kicks the back of CASTIEL’s legs and punches him as he falls to his knees. The LEVIATHANS continue to punch and kick CASTIEL, who falls heavily to the ground. The SECOND LEVIATHAN drags CASTIEL to his feet. CASTIEL hits her, sending her reeling backwards. The first LEVIATHAN grabs CASTIEL and his mouth transforms. DEAN appears behind the first LEVIATHAN and decapitates him. CASTIEL pushes the SECOND LEVIATHAN forward so that she is bent over and DEAN decapitates her. DEAN pulls CASTIEL, who is kneeling, to his feet.


DEAN
We got to move! The portal's closing! [They climb upwards towards the portal. CASTIEL stumbles.] Cas! Damn it! Come on!


DEAN reaches the portal and steps into it. He stretches out a hand to CASTIEL.


DEAN
Come on!


CASTIEL grabs DEAN’s hand.


DEAN
I got you! Hold on!


CASTIEL
Dean!


DEAN
Hold on!


CASTIEL loses his grip on DEAN’s hand and slides down.


CASTIEL
Dean!


The portal closes, taking DEAN with it.


EXT. ROAD – NIGHT


DEAN
Cas, can I talk to you outside?


DEAN and CASTIEL get out of the IMPALA.


CASTIEL
What?


DEAN
Exactly. What? What the hell happened? Back there. Purgatory. I told you I would get you out. We were there! It was like you just gave up. It's like you didn't believe we could do it. I mean, you kept saying that you didn't think it would work. Did you not trust me?


CASTIEL
Dean...


DEAN
I did everything I could to get you out – everything! I did not leave you.


CASTIEL
So you think this was your fault?


A car drives up. SAM gets out of the IMPALA. MRS TRAN parks next to the IMPALA and gets out of her car.


MRS TRAN
You can do this, can't you? You can get him back?


DEAN
How did Crowley find you?


MRS TRAN
Oh, I hired a witch, and she ratted us out.


SAM
A witch? Why'd you hire a witch?


MRS TRAN
To make demon bombs, of course! These are Kevin's notes. [She gives SAM a notebook.]


DEAN
You have any idea where Crowley took him?


MRS TRAN
No. But, uh... [she unlocks the trunk of her car] ...this guy might.


The DEMON she blasted with the Super-Soaker is inside the trunk bound by a Devil's Trap on the trunk lid.


DEAN
Oh. [He takes out his demon-killing knife.] Let's talk.


INT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – NIGHT


KEVIN is strapped to a chair in the room where CROWLEY tortured SAMANDIRIEL. A bloodstained table holds torture implements.


CROWLEY
I thought privacy might make it easier to chat. Decision time, Kevin. How's this going to go? Don't be recalcitrant, Kevin. You know it brings out the worst in me.


CROWLEY grabs a knife and cuts off one of KEVIN’s little fingers. KEVIN screams.


KEVIN
All right! Enough! I'll do it!


ACT FOUR
INT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – NIGHT


KEVIN is reading the stone tablet. His left hand is wrapped in a bloodstained bandage.


KEVIN
The next is... “The demonic influence on the collective tapestry of the soul.”


CROWLEY
Blah, blah, blah. Doesn't anyone ever edit this stuff? So far, as a writer, God's a snooze. No fun at parties, I hear.


KEVIN
Um, "Demonic transport to the regions of Hell."


CROWLEY
Tell me something I don't know! Think macro. This is stupefyingly micro.


KEVIN
How macro?


CROWLEY
Game changing.


EXT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


Atlantic, Iowa


The IMPALA and MRS TRAN’s car drive along the fence outside the factory. DEAN and CASTIEL are in the IMPALA. As MRS TRAN goes to get out of her car, SAM handcuffs her to the steering wheel.


SAM
Sorry, Mrs. Tran.


MRS TRAN
Wait! What?!


DEAN opens the trunk of MRS TRAN’s car.


DEAN
This it?


DEMON
Yes.


MRS TRAN
My son is in there!


SAM
Which means Crowley already has leverage. He doesn't need another hostage.


DEAN stabs the DEMON with his demon-killing knife. The DEMON’s eyes and mouth glow with bright orange light as he screams. DEAN closes the trunk. SAM gets out of MRS TRAN’s car.


MRS TRAN
Oh, come on!


INT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


CROWLEY
Yes? [He blows on a pinwheel to make it spin.]


KEVIN
Well...


CROWLEY
Don't provoke me, Kevin. You still have nine fingers. [He blows on the pinwheel again.]


KEVIN
This section has to do with building defensive weapons against demons.


CROWLEY
Mm-hmm. You're familiar with that one, I believe. [He blows on the pinwheel.]


KEVIN
And this one... describes, uh... sealing the gates of Hell.


CROWLEY
So it's true. It's there. Clearly, humans cannot possess this thing. What was God thinking? We'll get back to that. We're just getting to the sexy part.


EXT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL walk down stairs and under pipes. They pass a sign that reads “Beware: Sharp Edges - Keep Fingers Clear.” At a sign from DEAN, they step back out of sight as a DEMON approaches. DEAN stabs the DEMON in the back with his demon-killing knife. Its head glows with yellow light as it dies.


SAM
All right. I'll check that way.


SAM goes to the left. DEAN nods to CASTIEL and they go to the right.


INT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


The stone tablet seems to shake in KEVIN’s hands.


KEVIN
Hold on. This is different. It's – it's not text. It's like a personal note?


CROWLEY
A personal note from God?


KEVIN
From... the archangel... Metatron.


CROWLEY
The scribe... and suck-up. Took down God's word, picked up his cleaning.


KEVIN
It's like a – a farewell note.


CROWLEY
Go on.


CUT TO:


SAM walks down a flight of stairs. He sees four DEMONS in a room below him.


CUT TO:


KEVIN
“Upon completion of this task, I take my leave of my master in this world.”


CUT TO:


SAM walks inside the factory. Four DEMONS block his way.


DEMON
Winchester.


SAM
Looks like you guys got me.


As the DEMONS approach him, SAM takes out a bottle and throws it at the ground at the DEMONS’ feet. SAM covers his face as bright light flares and the DEMONS burn up and disappear. The DEMONS’ shadows are burnt into the wall behind them.


CUT TO:


DEAN and CASTIEL are walking through the factory.


CASTIEL
We're very near Kevin.


CUT TO:


SAM kicks a door open. He enters the room and sees the bloodstained octagonal table.


SAM
Oh, no.


The future prophets surface from underneath the table. The boy AARON WEBBER peers around a concrete block.


SAM
Hey. Uh... I'm here to help.


CUT TO:


CASTIEL and DEAN are walking through the factory. DEAN turns to find a DEMON behind him. He prepares to strike the DEMON with his knife, but the DEMON sends him flying into chains hanging from the ceiling in front of a window. The DEMON stretches out a hand towards CASTIEL. CASTIEL takes a couple of steps backwards before placing a hand on the DEMON’s head and smiting him. Yellow light flows from the DEMON’s eyes and mouth before he drops to the ground. CASTIEL steadies himself on the wall. DEAN picks himself up and puts a hand on CASTIEL’s shoulder.


DEAN
What the hell's going on? You're not all the way back, are you?


CUT TO:


KEVIN
“So ends the transcription of the sacred word for the defense of mankind. Into the hands of God's children thus passes the compendium of tablets."


CROWLEY
Compendium?


KEVIN
It's a collection of things, especially one systematically organized.


CROWLEY
I know what a "compendium" is, Kevin. What does Metatron mean?


CUT TO:


DEAN picks a lock.


DEAN
It's not working.


CASTIEL
Dean, I'm going in.


DEAN
Cas, no. You're not strong enough.


CUT TO:


CROWLEY
There are more tablets? More than "Leviathan" and "Demon"?


CASTIEL appears in the room with CROWLEY and KEVIN.


CROWLEY
Castiel. Fresh from Purgatory. I wish you'd called first.


CASTIEL
Crowley.


CROWLEY
Which Castiel is it this time? I'm never sure. Madman or megalomaniac?


CASTIEL
Kevin is coming with me.


CROWLEY
I think not. The Prophet's playing on my team now.


CASTIEL’s knife drops into his hand and he holds it up. CROWLEY holds up his hand and his own knife materializes in it. KEVIN stand up and backs a few paces away.


CASTIEL
So this is how it's gonna be?


CROWLEY
It's all very West Side Story, but let's be logical. You look like hell, and I should know. You're not up for this.


Light shines from CASTIEL. His eyes appear very blue and lit from within.


CROWLEY
Maybe you can get it up, but you can't keep it up.


The light coming from CASTIEL intensifies. Shadows of CASTIEL’s unfurling wings appear on the wall behind him.


CROWLEY
You're bluffing!


CASTIEL
Do you want to take that chance?


CASTIEL stretches out a hand to CROWLEY. CROWLEY reaches for the stone tablet on the table. CASTIEL smashes the tablet and the table. CROWLEY disappears while holding half the tablet. DEAN bursts into the room and goes to CASTIEL, who is lying on the floor. The light that was emanating from CASTIEL is gone. KEVIN picks up the remaining half of the stone tablet.


ACT FIVE
EXT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


MRS TRAN is wiping blood from KEVIN’s face.


SAM
Cops are on their way. They're gonna pick up the prophets. Um, they'll all be heading home.


MRS TRAN
What about us?


SAM
I called a friend of ours, Garth. He does what we do. Well... in his own way. He'll keep an eye on you guys. No more going off on your own. [MRS TRAN rolls her eyes.] You get that it was hiring that witch that got you into all this, right? How you holding up, Kev?


KEVIN
You kidding? I want to seal those bastards up forever. [He holds up his bandaged hand.] Took my finger.


SAM
Cas thinks he might be able to fix that. In the meantime, just lay low till we get back to you, okay?


CUT TO:


CASTIEL is standing next to DEAN, who is putting things in the trunk of the IMPALA.


DEAN
That was a bonehead move back there. You could have gotten yourself killed. Why didn't you wait for me?


CASTIEL
Well, I didn't get killed. And it worked.


DEAN
And if it didn't?


CASTIEL
It would have been my problem.


DEAN
Well, that's not the way I see it.


CASTIEL
Hey, everything isn't your responsibility. Getting me out of Purgatory wasn't your responsibility.


DEAN
You didn't get out. So whose fault was it?


CASTIEL
It's not about fault. It's about will. Dean, do you really not remember?


DEAN
[laughs shortly] I lived it, Cas. Okay, I know what happened.


CASTIEL
No. No, you think you know. You remembered it the way you needed to.


DEAN
Look, I don't need to feel like hell for failing you, okay? For failing you like I've failed every other godforsaken thing that I care about! I don't need it!


CASTIEL
Dean. Just look at it. Really look at it. [He touches DEAN on the forehead.]


FLASHBACK – PURGATORY


DEAN and CASTIEL are running uphill towards the portal. CASTIEL stumbles.


DEAN
Cas! Damn it! Come on!


DEAN reaches the portal and steps into it. He stretches out a hand to CASTIEL.


DEAN
Come on!


CASTIEL grabs DEAN’s hand.


DEAN
I got you! Hold on!


CASTIEL
Dean!


DEAN
Hold on!


CASTIEL
Dean!


CASTIEL breaks DEAN’s grip.


CASTIEL
Go!


The portal closes, taking DEAN with it.


EXT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


CASTIEL removes his fingers from DEAN’s forehead.


CASTIEL
See, it wasn't that I was weak. I was stronger than you. I pulled away. Nothing you could have done would have saved me, because I didn't want to be saved.


DEAN
What the hell are you talking about?


CASTIEL
It's where I belonged. I needed to do penance. After the things I did on earth and in heaven, I didn't deserve to be out. And I saw that clearly when I was there. I... I planned to stay all along. I just didn't know how to tell you. You can't save everyone, my friend... though, you try.


SAM joins DEAN and CASTIEL.


SAM
Hey. Everything okay?


CASTIEL
Yeah. Just, uh... setting a few things straight.


SAM
Good. Garth is gonna lay low with the Tra...


INT. OFFICE


The scene abruptly changes to CASTIEL standing in a brightly lit room, looking confused.


WOMAN
Hello, Castiel.


A WOMAN wearing a suit sits behind a desk.


CASTIEL
Where am I?


WOMAN
You don't know? You're home, Castiel.


CASTIEL
Heaven? I've never been here before.


WOMAN
Not many have. My name is Naomi. We rescued you.


CASTIEL
Purgatory.


NAOMI
An incursion of angels, which cost us many lives. Consider these chats your repayment.


CASTIEL
I don't understand.


NAOMI
Tell me about Sam and Dean.


CASTIEL
The Prophet is being kept safe. The tablet has split in two and the Winchesters are trying to recover the missing piece. Why am I telling you any of this?


NAOMI
It's not your concern. Help the Winchesters, come when they call. You will report in to me regularly, and you will never remember having done so.


CASTIEL
No. I won't do that.


NAOMI
[smiling] Now, as you were. They won't even notice you were gone.


EXT. WAREHOUSE/FACTORY – DAY


SAM
...track down the other piece. You're with us on this one, right, Cas? Cas, you okay?


CASTIEL
I'm – I'm fine. And, yes, I'm with you – if that's all right.


DEAN nods. CASTIEL walks away.


SAM
It is, right? You two are good?


DEAN
[looking down] Yeah.
