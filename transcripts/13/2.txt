TEASER
[INTERIOR – HELL – THRONE ROOM]
[A demon is stumbling through the room, slightly drunk.]
DEMON
Protecting the throne, Drexel? Face it, we’re done.
[The demon offers Drexel his bottle of booze. Drexel doesn’t take it.]
DREXEL
Lord Lucifer promised he would return. He’ll pull us out of chaos. He will make Hell great again.
DEMON
Do you even hear yourself?
[Electricity cackles. Lights fizzle.]
DREXEL
What did I tell you? Hmm?
[Doors open with a bang. ASMODEUS appears with a thunder. He walks to the throne.]
ASMODEUS
On your feet.
DEMON
Um… Who’d you say you were?
ASMODEUS
I am Asmodeus…
DREXEL
Fourth Prince of Hell.
ASMODEUS
…here to rule until such time as Lucifer returns with his son. And there are gonna be some changes. The underperforming and ineffective, the corporate lackeys in the Crowley era are being purged. The grand old days of fire and brimstone are back.
The following will step forward…
Mr. Drexel.
[DREXEL takes a step forward.]
ASMODEUS
Mr. Harrington. Mr. Sierra.
[They all take a step forward.]
ASMODEUS
As for the rest of y’all…
[ASMODEUS kills the demons he didn’t call. He takes off his jacket. Then, he turns to face the survivors.]
ASMODEUS
There’s a new sheriff in town.
[His eyes flash yellow.]

[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE
WYOMING
[EXTERIOR – ROAD - NIGHT]
[We see the IMPALA running down the street.]
[INTERIOR – IMPALA – NIGHT]
[JACK is sleeping in the backseat, against the car window. The camera moves to SAM, who’s looking at DEAN, worried.]
SAM
Hey, we still got probably 12 hours until we’re home. You want me to drive?
DEAN
Do I ever want you to drive?
SAM
Look… losing Mom and Cas, that’s a lot to process, Dean, especially on no sleep. And the kid—
DEAN
The “kid”? Come on, man, you know how this plays out.
Look, when we try to bend the rules, pretend that the bad guys aren’t so bad or that things will get fixed, that’s when people that we care about get hurt.
And then we end up doing what we should’ve done in the first place, which is end the problem.
So this time, let’s start with the obvious. Soon as I find a way to take care of… It.
SAM
Dean, “the problem” might be our only shot at saving Mom.
DEAN
Mom’s gone. There’s no fixing that.
[THUNDER]
[EXTERIOR - ALTERNATE UNIVERSE – DAY]
[MARY and LUCIFER are wandering in the desert.]
LUCIFER
Mary, not to be critical, but if we are ever gonna find a way out of here, uh, you gotta pick up the pace.
We got a lot of ground to cover, okay?
[MARY sits in the sand.]
MARY
Not sure I see the point, since… no matter how this plays out, you’re going to kill me.
LUCIFER
Why would I kill you?
Oh, that’s right. ‘Cause I’m evil. Yeah, let me tell you a couple of things, all right?
You don’t get to defy God and beat the Cage without having a modicum of intelligence, all right?
A game plan, i.e., I don’t want you dead because I need you alive.
All right, look, yeah, in a perfect world, I would probably kill you and your plodding sons. But life isn’t fair.
Your sons have my boy. So I’m gonna exchange you for my son.
MARY
You can’t possibly care about raising a child.
LUCIFER
Oh, you have no idea what I care about.
[Suddenly, a FIREBALL seemingly targets them. It lands and explodes not so far from where MARY was sitting. There’s smoke everywhere. LUCIFER stares at the point where the fireball landed.]
LUCIFER
What the hell?
Mary?!
[INTERIOR – HELL – THRONE ROOM]
[DREXEL enters the room, disheartened.]
DREXEL
No trace of Lucifer.
ASMODEUS
(sitting on the throne)
Indeed.
DREXEL
We scoured all of Hell. Even checked the Cage. Nothing.
ASMODEUS
At this point, we must focus on the son.
DREXEL
There’s no sign of him either, sir. Maybe a Sudden Infant Death?
ASMODEUS
He is not an infant. New to this world, yes, but he is full of timeless knowledge and unschooled power.
He lives. I know it.
(inhales deeply)
With Lucifer gone, I want him found and trained to rule. With me as his humble advisor, of course.
DREXEL
Okay.
[DREXEL starts writing a note.]
“Find son, but continue to search for Lucifer.”
Because if we didn’t, he’d be upset, and I—I can assure you, from personal experience, that an upset Lucifer has a, uh, short fuse.
[ASMODEUS clenches his fist. DREXEL starts choking.]
ASMODEUS
Are you equating your paltry acquaintance with our lord to mine?
DREXEL
(Choking) Uh…
ASMODEUS
Mine, which is born from eons of service and sacrifice?
[DREXEL doesn’t reply. ASMODEUS stops choking him.]
ASMODEUS
I know the perils of Lucifer’s disappointment.
[DREXEL indicates the SCARS on ASMODEUS’ face.]
DREXEL
He—he did that?
ASMODEUS
Long ago. Eager to please, I freed the shedim.
DREXEL
You… Oh, I’ve heard stories about—
ASMODEUS
Oh, I’m sure you have. Hell’s most savage. Things so dark, and base, God himself would not allow them into the light. But I, in my pride, believed that I could train them. Use them. But Lucifer feared them, as well he should, so he forbade it, locked them up again.
He was… (indicates his own scars) “disappointed” in me.
DREXEL
Mm. Mm.
ASMODEUS
The pain, the, uh, the total humiliation… it forged an eternal bond between us.
I am his to command, as you are mine.
Write that down.
[EXTERIOR – MOTEL “THE BLACK HAT” – NIGHT]
[Establishing shot of the MOTEL’s neon sign.]
[INTERIOR – MOTEL – CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS]
[DEAN, SAM and JACK are walking to their room.]
DEAN
This is a bad idea. We should’ve just kept driving.
SAM
Dude… (scoffs) you were hallucinating sheep on the road. We need a few hours.
[They walk into their room. DEAN turns the lights on.]
JACK
This is nice.
SAM
Let’s ward the room, get a bite, get a few hours of sleep, hit the road first thing.
[SAM turns on the TV. An episode of SCOOBY-DOO is airing. JACK is sitting on the bed, watching, mesmerized.]
JACK
It’s… wonderful.
DEAN
Hey. No.
JACK
But… Y—
[DEAN glances at the TV. He chuckles.]
DEAN
No.
[He turns off the TV.]
And you’re on the couch, sport. All right? So why don’t you go over there? Sit down and… (chuckles) Here.
[DEAN throws a copy of the HOLY BIBLE at JACK.]
DEAN
Read a book. We’re out of here in a few hours.
[JACK grabs the BIBLE, starts reading through its pages. He lingers on “THE SONG OF SOLOMON”.]
SAM
Jack, hey, I can take the couch. Why don’t—
JACK
No, no. It’s fine.
[JACK keeps leafing through the BIBLE.]
[Cut to: INTERIOR – MOTEL’S ROOM – LATER]
[JACK is eating a BURGER. DEAN watches him. SAM finishes warding the door and sits on the couch in front of them.]
DEAN
You can slow down, you know. That’s stuff’s not gonna disappear.
SAM
Ever seen you eat, Dean?
[DEAN grabs and opens a bottle of beer. JACK imitates him.]
DEAN
Wait, wait, wait, wait. How old do you think you are?
JACK
3 days, 17 hours, and 42 minutes.
[DEAN drinks the beer. JACK copies him.]
JACK
This book, it mentions my father. Not Castiel, but Lucifer.
DEAN
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he’s—he’s big in the Bible. Lotta screen time.
JACK
And you… knew him?
SAM
Well, he’s not really an easy guy to know. He’s, um, he’s kind of rough around the edges.
DEAN
He’s Satan.
JACK
And that’s… that’s bad.
DEAN
Damn straight. See… he turned on his father, God.
JACK
God, he’s in here, too. Is he famous or something?
SAM
Yeah. Um, God basically… created everything.
DEAN
Yeah, and then he skipped out, leaving guys like us to clean up his messes like Lucifer.
JACK
So, God’s like my grandfather. He’s family, and that’s… That’s good.
DEAN
Sometimes.
[DEAN puts a foot on the table. JACK copies him.]
DEAN
Okay, all right, will you stop?
SAM
So, Jack, we know Kelly taught you things before you were born. And obviously, you can, you know, make people or things move with your mind. But, um… what else can you do?
JACK
I… don’t know.
SAM
Okay. For instance, say you wanted to—to be someplace else right now. Could you?
DEAN
Can you teleport?
JACK
Teleport.
DEAN
Yes. If you wanted to be on the other side of that door right this instant, what would you do?
[JACK walks out of the door and closes it behind him.]
DEAN
What…
Great.
[JACK knocks on the door.]
SAM
You know, it’s possible he’s more human than we thought.
DEAN
Mm—hmm.
[SAM opens the door. JACK gets back into the room, smiling.]
JACK
Like that.
DEAN
Come on. You’re trying to tell me you didn’t pick up anything before you were born?
That your father never reached out to you?
[FLASHBACK]
[JACK remembers scattered and confused visions of LUCIFER.]
DEAN
What?
SAM
Jack? Hey. You all right?
JACK
Yeah. Uh, good. I’m good.
[INTERIOR – MOTEL – CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS]
[Camera moves down to show a mysterious MAN walking through the corridor.]
[BACK INSIDE THE ROOM]
SAM
All right, I say we, uh… (sighs) get some rest. It’s been a long day. We’re startin’ early tomorrow.
[The floorboard CREAKS. Someone is approaching the room’s door. SAM grabs a gun. DEAN opens the door.]
[DEAN grabs the MAN and throws him inside. It’s DONATELLO.]
SAM
Donatello?
DONATELLO
Sam? Dean? Is God with you?

==ACT TWO==
[INTERIOR – MOTEL’S ROOM – DAY]
[DONATELLO sits on the couch.]
SAM
You okay?
DONATELLO
Ah, pretty much. No soul of course, thanks to Amara.
It’s kinda like losing your appendix. You never really noticed it when you had it.
(Groans) But now, when I come to a moral croassroad, I ask myself, “What would Mr. Rogers do?”
And as soon as I nail that, I’m usually good.
DEAN
Why are you here?
DONATELLO
Yes. That is the question we all must ask.
DEAN
Why are you in Wyoming?
DONATELLO
Oh! Uh, well… (clears throat) After God left, I said to myself, “Donatello, you are so retired.”
I mean, who needs a prophet of God when there is no God?
So… a few days ago, I’m online, checking out condos in Boca, and I am knocked off my feet by this weird wave of power.
Not exactly like God’s. More like… something new, something fresh. I was drawn to it.
It’s here.
[SAM looks at JACK.]
DONATELLO
Wow. Right here. It’s… (looks at Jack) you. Who are you?
JACK
I’m… Jack.
SAM
Jack is a Nephilim.
DONATELLO
A child of a human and an angel.
SAM
Archangel, actually. Um… Lucifer.
DONATELLO
Lucifer?
SAM
And Donatello here is a prophet.
DEAN
Which means he has a direct line to God, or Heaven.
DONATELLO
Yes, well, not so much anymore. But, uh… (to Jack) Look at you. The waves of power… so intense.
DEAN
Maybe less human than we thought.
DONATELLO
Fascinating. You know, I’ve met your father. Your power’s nothing like his. Not dark, not toxic.
SAM
That so?
DEAN
Not yet.
SAM
If Jack is sending out a signal strong enough to get Donatello all the way out here…
The angels are still out there. I mean, who knows what else might be listening?
He needs protection.
[INTERIOR – TATTOO SHOP – NIGHT]
[SAM is showing the TATTOOIST the design for an anti-possession symbol tattoo.]
SAM
All right, so, uh… I’m thinking something like this, right about here.
[SAM puts the tattoo design on JACK’s chest.]
Uh, you know what? Exactly like that.
TATTOOIST
(to Jack)
And you’re cool with this?
JACK
Y—Yeah.
DEAN
Turn the damn thing on and start buzzin’.
SAM
W—we’re brothers. It’s kind of like a family crest.
[SAM shows his own anti-possession tattoo. The TATTOOIST looks convinced.]
SAM
(whispers to Dean)
So you heard DONATELLO. No evil vibes from Jack.
DEAN
Proves nothing, except that you’re way too attached to this kid.
You need to see this for what it is, okay? I mean, what do you need, a sign?
[The TATTOOIST prepares to do his work.]
SAM
Dean, whatever his powers are or will be… if we train him properly, they could be used for good.
[As soon as the TATTOOIST starts working on JACK, his machine malfunctions, and he is violently thrown back against the wall.]
TATTOOIST
Aah!
DEAN
Well, there’s your sign.
(to Jack) Did you do that?
JACK
I’m not sure.
[SAM goes to check on the TATTOOIST.]
SAM
Hey. You all right?
JACK
It hurt.
DEAN
Okay, see, sometimes, things hurt, so you just man up and deal with it.
JACK
Yes. I understand. Pain is a part of the complete human experience. Accepting it is a sign of maturity.
DEAN
All right. (To the tattooist) I think your, uh, machine might’ve fritzed out there. You might wanna get that looked at.
TATTOOIST
Uh…
DEAN
Yeah.
[TRANSITION TO: the TATTOOIST finishing his work.]
TATTOOIST
Okeydokey.
[JACK now has an ANTI-POSSESSION SYMBOL and a WARDING SIGIL tattooed on his chest.]
SAM
Looks good, Jack.
[JACK stares down at his own chest. Both tattoos slowly disappear.]
DEAN
Well, there’s your second sign.
[A DEMON possessing a homeless woman watches DEAN, SAM and JACK as they get into the car to leave the tattoo shop.]
[INTERIOR – MOTEL’S ROOM – NIGHT]
[JACK is sitting on the couch. DEAN, SAM and DONATELLO are in a corner, discussing what happened at the tattoo shop.]
SAM
It was a reflex. He didn’t do it on purpose.
DEAN
Who cares if he didn’t do it on purpose? He did it. I mean, you didn’t see Cas smiting someone every time he got his teeth cleaned.
JACK
I’m right here, you know.
DEAN
Yeah, and what about the vanishing tattoo?
DONATELLO
An archangel healed himself.
SAM
Another reflex.
DEAN
Or maybe he didn’t want to be warded.
SAM
Okay, look, yeah, Jack is on Lucifer’s family tree. But we don’t know if that DNA is stronger than Kelly’s, or his connection with Cas.
DEAN
Oh, you mean the connection that got Cas killed?
SAM
I’m just saying, Jack doesn’t have to be evil. We can teach him not to be.
DONATELLO
Ah. The nature versus nurture conundrum.
[DONATELLO pats DEAN and SAM’s shoulders.]
DEAN
Hey.
SAM
Dude.
DONATELLO
Oh. Speaking not as a prophet but as a scientist, I don’t think teaching him is in the cards.
It’s like asking a lion not to be a lion.
SAM
(angrily)
But this is not a lion! This is a human!
DONATELLO
With a strong dose of God juice.
DEAN
Okay, that’s it. I’m done, all right? ‘Cause he’s not God, he’s not Cas, he’s not Simba. He’s the friggin’ Devil!
[When Dean turns to address JACK, he’s gone.]
SAM
Jack?
DONATELLO
Uh—oh.
[EXTERIOR – STREET OUTSIDE THE MOTEL – NIGHT]
[JACK is sitting in a corner. He remembers his mother, KELLY, and her words.]
KELLY
I love you, Jack.
[We see scattered memories of KELLY talking to JACK while he was still in the womb.]
KELLY
I love you so much. You are gonna be amazing.
[SAM finds JACK.]
SAM
Jack? Hey. Hey, bud. We, uh, we’ve been looking for ya.
JACK
I’m sorry. I… Everyone was so angry.
SAM
Yeah, and, um… I suppose you wanted to be away from it.
JACK
And suddenly, I was.
SAM
I’ll tell you what. You got some special skills, Jack. That’s for sure.
[SAM sits next to JACK.]
We just need to make sure we get a grip on ‘em, so… so you don’t hurt anybody.
JACK
Is that why Dean hates me?
SAM
Dean doesn’t hate you. It… Look, sometimes the wires in Dean’s head get crossed and—and he gets frustrated, and then he mixes frustration with anger, and—and fear.
JACK
Why would he be afraid?
SAM
Because Dean feels like it’s his job to protect everyone. And right now, we need to protect you. But we may also need to protect people from you.
JACK
Maybe I’m not worth all this.
SAM
Your mom thought you were. So did Cas. So do I.
[INTERIOR – “BLACK SPUR” BAR – NIGHT]
[DEAN is sitting at the counter, checking his phone. He’s been drinking.]
BARTENDER
Getcha another?
DEAN
Yeah. Sure.
BARTENDER
What the hell? You’re not drivin’, right?
I’ve just—I’ve seen you around the hotel. Passin’ through with… what, your buddies?
DEAN
Uh, that’s my brother, and some messed up kid.
BARTENDER
Oh, the kid’s messed up?
DEAN
Yeah, issues with his dad.
BARTENDER
The older fella.
DEAN
No, that’s, uh, Donatello. Uh, he’s a… guy we work with.
BARTENDER
I hated my old man. I ran away myself. See, my mom would never stick up for me. But… (sighs) you know kids. No matter what, they still want the old man’s approval.
Well, that’s how it was with me, just…
DEAN
You know, that’s, uh, that’s how it was with me, too.
BARTENDER
I’m talkin’ your ear off I’ll—I’ll grab you that drink.
DEAN You know what? I’m good. Uh, I’m gonna take a walk.
[DEAN downs his last drink. He leaves a tip on the counter]
There you go. Thank you.
BARTENDER
Thanks.
[As DEAN leaves, the CAMERA moves down, behind the counter, to reveal the body of the true bartender, dead. Our BARTENDER turns into ASMODEUS. He gets himself a drink.]

==ACT THREE==
[INTERIOR – MOTEL’S ROOM – MORNING]
[Somebody’s knocking on the door.]
SAM
Come in.
[DONATELLO gets in.]
SAM
Hey. Hi.
DONATELLO
Good morning!
SAM
How’s Jack? Uh, by the way, sorry to stick him with you.
Things got a little tense here last night, so I figured it’d be better to have him stay in your room.
DONATELLO
It’s not a big deal. He’s an interesting kid.
SAM
Yeah. Yeah, that’s an understatement.
DONATELLO
Let—let me ask ya… Do you have any idea how powerful he’ll get to be?
SAM
I—I don’t. No. But the, uh, the lore says, quote, “A Nephilim becomes more powerful than the angel who sired it.” In this case, the sire is an archangel. So…
DONATELLO
Does he know about his father?
SAM
Vaguely.
DONATELLO
So, he’s not bonded to Lucifer.
SAM
He seems to have a real attachment to his mom, but only kinda a fuzzy idea about his dad.
And his mom, Kelly, was a really good person, so that makes me think Jack can be molded the right way.
DONATELLO
Mm, molded. I hope you’re right.
SAM
Yeah.
[DONATELLO leaves.]
[THUNDERCLAP]
[EXTERIOR – ALTERNATE UNIVERSE – DAY]
[We see MARY walking through the desert. There are plenty of dead bodies around. A HUNTER who was hiding behind a rock points a SHOTGUN at her.]
HUNTER
Who the hell are you?
MARY
Mary. Mary Winchester. I’m a Hunter.
HUNTER
Doubt it. Come here.
[MARY gets closer.]
HUNTER
You don’t walk like an angel. They all walk like they got sticks up their asses.
[He throws some HOLY WATER at MARY.]
Not a demon neither.
MARY
I told you.
HUNTER
I ain’t never met a female Hunter. Not many women, period, since the wars began.
MARY
Wars?
HUNTER
What rock you been under?
MARY
I’m not from around here.
HUNTER
Oh.
MARY
I don’t know anything. I just got attacked by some kind of fireball or something.
HUNTER
(Laughs) Angels, yeah. Always takin’ shots.
[He gets closer, creepily.]
Maybe I can… help you find your way.
MARY
(Walking backwards) I’m good.
HUNTER
Ah. (He grabs her arm) Let’s keep this friendly, huh?
[MARY punches him. They start fighting.]
HUNTER
Bitch!
[The HUNTER throws MARY on the ground, gets the ready to shoot her when… LUCIFER kills him.]
LUCIFER
You’re welcome. Uh, Mary, in case you didn’t notice, you left without me.
What is wrong with you? We need each other! This is a win-win situation. Okay?
We gotta get outta this… theme park, we both get our boys back.
MARY
You think I want you to win?
[LUCIFER sighs deeply. He snaps his fingers. MARY hunches in pain.]
[LUCIFER snaps his fingers again. The pain stops.]
LUCIFER
Yeah, I’m—I’m afraid I’m gonna have to insist.
[INTERIOR – MOTEL’S ROOM – MORNING]
[DEAN enters the room with breakfast.]
SAM
Hey. Hey.
DEAN
We should probably hit it.
SAM
Uh, I was just gonna call you, actually. Um, look… we are gonna be on the road a long time today. Right?
DEAN
Yeah. Well, you know, we don’t have to be ‘cause your new pal could just zap us back to the bunker like that.
SAM
Point is… (sighs) if you and I are gonna do this, keep Jack on the right side of things, then—then we have to be on the same page.
DEAN
Okay. Well, that’s the problem, though, Sam, ‘cause we’re not on the same page. Like, at all.
SAM
All right. You know what? I know what’s going on here.
DEAN
Oh. Okay. Well, please, tell me, what’s going on here?
SAM
You thinking mom is gone and Cas is gone, and that Jack can’t be saved. (Sighs) Dean, after everything we’ve gone through… We just lost people we love, people who have been in our lives for a long time.
Everything’s upside-down. I get it. But we’ve been down before. I mean, rock bottom. And we find a way.
We fix it because that’s what we do. And Jack w—wants to do the right thing. Jack’s scared to death of who he is, and he’s scared of you.
[Somebody knocks on the door.]
SAM
Come in.
DONATELLO
Morning, guys.
Uh, got a minute? I, uh, wanna talk to you about Jack.
SAM
We just talked about Jack.
DONATELLO
What?
SAM
You were just here.
DONATELLO
(Chuckles) No, I wasn’t. I was grabbing breakfast burritos. Extra spicy.
[DEAN and SAM look at each other. They walk to JACK’S ROOM.]
DEAN
Jack?!
[The room is empty.]
SAM
He’s gone.

==ACT FOUR==
[INTERIOR – MOTEL – DONATELLO’S ROOM – CONTINUOUS]
SAM
Okay. Okay. So, so, so, so… who’s got Jack? And who was I—or what was I talkin’ to? A shifter?
DEAN
What would a shifter want with Jack?
[DONATELLO drops his bag and starts leaving.]
DEAN
Where you going, cowboy?
DONATELLO
He—he went this way.
SAM
You sure?
DONATELLO
I can feel it.
DEAN
I’ll get the gear.
[DEAN goes back to their room. He is attacked by the demon SIERRA. They fight. When DEAN is about to lose, SAM stabs the demon in the back with an angel blade.]
DEAN
First angels, now demons. Terrific.
SAM
I guess the word’s out.
DEAN
Donatello.
[They run out just to see DONATELLO being thrown against the wall by another demon. DEAN kills the demon with an angel blade.]
DEAN Well, housekeeping is not gonna like this.
[EXTERIOR – HELL GATE – JASPER, WYOMING – DAY]
[The fake DONATELLO, impersonated by ASMODEUS, and JACK are in the middle of a field, on a patch of soil surrounded by logs.]
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Jack. As a prophet, Jack, I speak the words of God. Do you know who God is?
JACK
Yes. Kind of.
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Well, son. God has a message for you. You must prepare yourself, Jack. Train yourself to use your gifts. To fulfill your destiny.
JACK
How?
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Long ago, a troop of God’s bravest soldiers were trapped in a distant cavern of a place called Hell.
JACK
I’ve read about Hell. It doesn’t sound nice.
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
It’s not. That’s why we have to rescue the soldiers. They’re called the shedim, and God wants you to set them free. To be a hero.
JACK
I could do that?
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Yeah! And so much more. Uh… You see that patch of earth there? Imagine the force of your will, drilling down into infinite darkness, the soldiers being drown to the surface. Do it, Jack! Do it for God! Focus!
JACK
I’m trying.
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Try harder, boy!
[Cut to: the IMPALA running down the road.]
[INTERIOR – IMPALA – DAY]
[The boys are following DONATELLO’s directions to find JACK.]
DONATELLO
Uh, turn!
Th—This is worrisome. I’m sensing a power emanation alongside Jack’s. It gets stronger then closer we got to it.
[DONATELLO sees a sign: JASPER, 3mil.]
Jasper, Wyoming?
DEAN
Maybe it’s an angel.
DONATELLO
No. Something dark.
DEAN Do you ever have any good news?
All right, well, see if there’s anything in Jasper that’s demon-y.
SAM
Yeah, there is. According to dad’s journal, Jasper is home to its very own Gate to Hell.
It gets better.
DEAN
Fantastic.
SAM
According to legend, this particular gate leads to, quote, “A place where unimaginable evil emanates from creatures too wicked for the Pit to hold”.
DEAN
What the hell does that mean?
DONATELLO
They’re really bad. Ah! Turn!
[EXTERIOR – ALTERNATE UNIVERSE – DAY]
[LUCIFER and MARY are still walking.]
LUCIFER
Are you tired? Really? (laughs) You know what? Let me tell you a couple of things. First of all, we gotta blow this taco stand before who knows what happens to my son.
And second of all, you’re the reason that we are even stuck in this literally godforsaken place to begin with. So I’m sorry you’re tired.
It’s not my fault you were born a wimpy little human with your wimpy little lungs and your weak little legs.
MARY
What?
LUCIFER
You heard me. Don’t say another word on this trip, okay?
[A group of ANGELS suddenly appears.]
LUCIFER
Just what I need. Angels. Hey.
ANGEL
I sense a creature that stinks of Hell.
LUCIFER
Oh, yeah. That would be her.
ANGEL
False! Identify yourself.
LUCIFER
I’m Lucifer.
ANGEL
False.
LUCIFER
Not, I’m pretty sure I’m—I’m Lucifer. (to Mary) You wanna tell this guy who I am?
ANGEL
False. Lucifer was killed by the archangel Michael.
LUCIFER
What? This place is nuts!
ANGEL
Freeze!
LUCIFER
Oh, what are you gonna… Are you gonna smite me?
ANGEL
(to the angels) On my command.
LUCIFER
Oh, for the love of…
[The angels get ready to smite LUCIFER.]
ANGEL
Now!
[LUCIFER snaps his fingers and the angels disintegrate into smoke.]
LUCIFER
Was he kidding? I mean, even in the land of Bizarro, an angel isn’t gonna try to…
[A FIREBALL lands close to them.]
LUCIFER
Oh, come on!
[Surrounded by white smoke, we see a MAN standing and the silhouette of a pair of WINGS. The man walks up to LUCIFER and MARY.]
MICHAEL
You should be dead.
LUCIFER
Eh… Okay. And who are you and what spaghetti western coughed you up?
MICHAEL
Don’t you know me, brother?
LUCIFER
Michael?
[EXTERIOR – HELL GATE – JASPER, WYOMING – DAY]
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Summon up all your will, Jack! Do it for God!
[JACK focuses. The earth shakes. His eyes turn yellow. He manages to drill a hole in the soil beneath him.]
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
(Evil laughter) You’re doing it! He’s doing it! Yes!
[CUT TO: The IMPALA running faster.]
[BACK TO JACK, who’s opening the prison of the shedim.]
JACK
It’s working!
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Don’t lose focus! Don’t lose focus, Jack!
[JACK focuses on his task. The hand of a SHEDIM begins to crawl out.]
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
He’s doing it! Keep focused!
[SAM, DEAN and DONATELLO arrive.]
SAM Jack! Hey! Stop.
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Don’t listen to them, Jack!
DEAN
Holy crap.
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
Focus!
DONATELLO
That’s not Donatello!
ASMODEUS/DONATELLO
No, that’s not Donatello!
DEAN
Ah, screw this.
[DEAN shoots fake Donatello. He turns into ASMODEUS.]
SAM
Jack, he’s a demon!
ASMODEUS
Howdy, boys.
[ASMODEUS starts choking SAM, DEAN and DONATELLO.]
JACK
No!
[The SHEDIM crawl back into the earth. The crack in the soil regenerates.]
ASMODEUS Jack… They wanna stop you. Contain you. I can give you the world.
JACK
You’re hurting my friends!
[JACK’s eyes turn yellow. The earth starts shaking. ASMODEUS vanishes before Jack can hurt him. DEAN, SAM and DONATELLO stop choking.]

==ACT FIVE==
[EXTERIOR – ALTERNATE UNIVERSE – DAY]
MICHAEL
You are Lucifer. I can feel it. But how is that even possible?
LUCIFER
Um… You know, alternate universes, interdimensional travel, blah, blah, blah. It’s her fault.
Uh, I’ll buy that you’re Michael, but you sort of seem like a cheap knockoff to the one I left behind, and he’s a hot mess.
MICHAEL
I killed my Lucifer. Tore him apart in the skies over Abilene. But hey, can’t get enough of a good thing.
LUCIFER
Um… Okay. Why not?
[They start fighting. MICHAEL grabs LUCIFER’s arm and twists it.]
MICHAEL
Hurt?
LUCIFER
No. It’s kinda wimpy. Aah!
(groans in pain)
What are you gonna do? Kill me?
MICHAEL
Or… maybe not. Maybe I need you.
[INTERIOR – BUNKER’S KITCHEN]
[SAM and DEAN are having a beer. SAM is consulting the lore.]
SAM
These yellow-eyed things just keep on comin’, huh?
DEAN
Mm—hmm. And hopefully this fourth Prince of Hell is the last Kardashian in the family.
SAM
According to this, if that was Asmodeus, it’s the end of the line.
[DEAN makes to leave.]
SAM
Dean, wait a second. (Sighs) The kid came through for us today. Jack saved us.
DEAN
No. No, whatever that was, that was a reflex. It was a sneeze.
Maybe next time he sneezes, he kills us. Good night.
[DEAN hears a clacking sound coming from a distance. He follows the noise to JACK’s room.]
JACK
Ah!
[DEAN finds JACK trying to stab himself with a blade. The wounds immediately heal.]
DEAN
Okay. What the hell?
(he gets in the room)
Give me that. You—Don’t be an idiot. Look, A, this is not gonna do anything to you, okay? And B, you… What the hell?
JACK
Exactly. What the hell am I? I can’t control… whatever this is. I will hurt someone.
DEAN
You know, my brother thinks you can be saved.
JACK
You don’t believe that.
DEAN
No, I don’t.
JACK
So… if you’re right?
DEAN
If I’m right… and it comes to killing you… I’ll be the one to do it.
[DEAN leaves.]
