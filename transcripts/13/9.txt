NOW
[Interior: an art studio. Jazz music plays as a couple kisses. The woman looks at a painting of a shadowy figure with glowing red eyes]
Paula: That one keeps staring at me.
Derek: Well, don't look at it.

[she pulls away from their embrace]
Paula: I have to go to work.
Derek: Ah. (he chuckles) Paula: So? Who is this buyer anyway?
Derek: I don't know. He emailed yesterday. He must have seen the Examiner piece. Probably some gawking Wasichu.
Paula: (giggles)
Derek: You know, if studio visits led to actual sales, I wouldn't be two months late for rent. (Door buzzer rings)
Paula: Speak of the devil.

[She crosses the room and opens the door, revealing Jack]
Jack: Hello.
Derek: Jack. Welcome. Uh, you're... young.
Jack: I am.
Paula: (trying to control her laughter) Okay. Uh, well. I will leave you to it. [she kisses Derek and leaves]
Derek (to Jack): Come on in.
[Jack walks inside the studio and the door slams shut]
Derek: Yeah, look around. I work in oil, digital, whatever suits my subject. I just started a piece.
Jack: You're a dreamwalker.
Derek: Excuse me?
Jack: The article. You talked about your process, your inspiration. How your mind moves into different worlds.
Derek: It's just a story, just for the catalogues.
[He turns and walks away from Jack, further into the studio, visibly uncomfortable by Jack's persistence]
Jack: You're Derek Swan, Oglala Sioux, born and raised in the Pine Ridge Reservation.
Derek: I get it. You read the article.
Jack: Your father was medicine man, and his father before him. Your lineage traces all the way back to Shaman Black Elk. You can see other worlds.
Derek: Look, if you are not gonna buy...
Jack: I want you to do it. Dream walk, for me.
Derek: That's not gonna happen.
[Jack removes a wad of money from his pocket and places it on the table]

Jack: I can pay.

[Derek looks at the money and clears his throat]
Derek: If I was gonna do this, if... where do you want me to go?
[Jack raises his arm to point to a painting behind Derek]

Jack: There. I want you to go there. [Derek turns and we see a painting Derek has made of the Apocalypse World.]
[Derek places his feet in a square tray of water and pebbles. He sits in a chair, surrounded by candles. He closes his eyes and whispers indistinctly as he prepares to dreamwalk.]
Derek: I'm there. This place... (he exhales sharply) it's not my favorite.
Jack: Keep going. You know what to look for.
Derek: I see.. I see a structure ahead. A fortress. I'm getting closer. This world...
Jack: You have to keep going.
[Derek's eyes are clenched shut and his breathing is ragged as if he's struggling.]

Derek: I'm not strong enough. (he groans)
[Jack rushes to his side. He moves to stand behind Derek's chair.]
Jack: No! stay!
[Derek groans in pain as Jack places his fingertips on Derek's temples. The yellow power veins crisscross on Derek's temple. Jack's eyes glow yellow. Derek gasps in pain.]
Jack: I- I see it.
[Derek continues to groan with pain in his chair.]
Jack: I- I see it all. I see...
[The water in the tray beneath Derek's feet begins to bubble and steam. Jack is still focused on looking at the Apocalypse World, his eyes still glowing yellow.]
Derek: (grunting in pain) Stop, Please! (he screams out in pain as the screen cuts to black) Aah!
[Paula returns to the studio. She calls out to Derek as the door closes behind her.]
Paula: Derek? Hey, Derek. I'm... home.
[She pauses, concerned, seeing Derek's feet sticking out from behind the table. He is lying on the floor and she walks over to see why]
Paula: Derek, what are you ... (she gasps)
[Derek lies dead on the floor with his eyes burnt out. She gasps and screams.]
Paula: Aaahh!

TITLE CARD

[We hear a heavy door open and close in darkness, which resolves into: Interior, the bunker. Dean, carrying a paper bag, walks down the hallway with his phone pressed to his ear, having reached Patience's voicemail]
Hi, you've reached Patience Turner. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. (beep)

[while he listens to Patience's message, he enters the war room, where Sam is working on his laptop. He leaves a message for Patience, setting his bag on the table and taking a seat.]
Dean: Patience, hey. This is, uh, Dean Winchester. Listen, I know that I, uh, told you to avoid this life, but, uh... me and my brother, we're– we're looking for someone. And we put an APB out with every hunter we know, and... nothing. We really could use a psychic's help on this. So... if you could call me back. Thanks. [his cell phone beeps as he hangs up and he talks to Sam]

Dean: Any word from Cas?

Sam: Yeah. Uh, he says he's still looking for Jack, working a lead in Tucson.
[Dean's phone rings in his hand and he shows the phone to Sam]
Sam: Hmm.
[The phone continues to ring. Dean answers it and puts the phone on speaker, setting it on the table so Sam can hear it too. Sam shuts the lid of his laptop]
Dean: Hi Jody!
Sam: Hi Jody! What's going on?
Jody (on the speakerphone): Hey boys, I got something for ya. Friend of mine from Bismarck PD called with a lead. He said that a local artist was found dead with his eyes burned out.
[Sam startles. Dean meanwhile is digging into his bag. He turns back to the phone]
Dean: Sounds angel-y.
Jody: Yeah, that's what I thought, except for that there was a witness– the victim's girlfriend. She pegged someone at the scene.
[Jody sits at her table and looks over the artist sketch of Jack]
Jody: She gave the police a description. I think its your boy.
[We see a side by side comparison of Jack's photograph and his sketch on Jody's computer screen. Back at the bunker, Sam and Dean look at each other consideringly.]

[Interior, Patience Turner's room, where she sits at her desk with books open for studying. She looks warily at her phone, which shows 6 missed calls from Dean Winchester. Her father calls out to her from the hallway]
James: Patience?
Patience: I'll be down in a minute.
[James comes to her room and stands at the doorway. Patience discreetly turns her phone over. James sighs.]
James: Mr. Caruthers called.
Patience: Great. [she sighs and turns to her father] It's one test. So I got a C. Not like I flunked.
James: So is that the new standard? Passing? Baby, you know the plan. Perfect SATs, perfect GPA, and you got your pick of the Ivies. You got twice the mind I do. You stay focused, there's nothing you can't have, nothing you can't do.
Patience: I can think of one thing.

James: What?

Patience: (sighs) Dean Winchester called me today. [James walks into Patience's room and stands beside her desk]

James: The Hunter? Why?
Patience: He and his brother want my help. Psychic help.
James: And what'd you say?
Patience: Nothing. I didn't answer.
James: (sighs) Patience, what's going on? Everything is working, isn't it? No visions? Right? [Patience smiles stiffly]
Patience: Right. [James pats her on the shoulder and walks out of the room. Once he exits, Patience again picks up the phone and sees Dean Winchester's name on the display.]

[Exterior: The Impala, riding down the highway.]
[Interior: Derek Swan's art studio, Bismarck, North Dakota: Derek's girlfriend walks around his studio holding Jack's photograph, while Sam and Dean interview her]
Paula: That's him. He said his name was Jack, that he was a buyer.
Sam: Um... a buyer?
[She points at the numerous paintings around the studio.]
Sam: Ah.
Dean: Some freaky stuff here. Derek had quite the imagination.
Paula: He hated that word.
Sam: What, freaky?
Paula: Imagination. [Dean turns and glances at her]
He liked to think of his art more as reportage. [Dean rolls his eyes and turns away]
Sam: Reportage? Reportage from where?
Paula: From the places he'd visit.
[Dean keeps walking around the studio. He stops near a particular painting, now partially hidden behind a stack of other canvases.]Paula: Derek was a dream walker.
Dean: Sam?
[Sam turns and looks towards Dean. Dean reveals one of Derek's paintings, depicting the landscape from the Apocalypse World]

[Exterior: Derek's art studio, where a huge mural of wings is painted on the wall in front of where the Impala is parked. In the front seat, Sam has been going through John Winchester's journal. Dean walks towards the car with a tray of coffee in hand. He joins Sam in the car and offers him a cup of coffee.]
Sam: Hey. Thanks.
Dean: Yeah.
Sam: So the lore on dreamwalking is pretty inconsistent. Uh, there are stories about it across numerous Native Amer–
Dean: Sam, we gonna talk about it?
Sam: What?
Dean: You saw that paining.

Sam: Yeah.
Dean: And? Well, it looks like Jack gave up on us and he's looking for daddy.
Sam: Dean, we don't know that.
Dean: Don't we? A guy is dead. Look, I hate this too, but we've gotta be prepared.
Sam: To kill him.
Dean: Look, this isn't an I told you so. Okay? I mean... I actually like the kid. I do. But, we're in worst case scenario land here.
Sam: Yeah, but, Dean we need more information. I mean (sigh) we gotta figure out what Jack wanted, how– how dreamwalking even works.

Dean: Okay, well, then let's go to a reservation. Let's talk to a– a chief or a tribal leader.

Sam: Or, we talk to a dreamwalker. I hacked into Derek's email. He's been corresponding with another dreamwalker for months, a girl named Kaia Nieves. He had been trying to coach her, to teach her to control her power.
Dean: Alright. Where is she?

[Interior, a group NA meeting, where we see a girl's hands as she slowly picks apart a styrofoam coffee cup while others talk in the background]

Frankie: I- I would've sold my son for another hit. I know if I wasn't here, I- I probably still would.
Man: That's excellent sharing Frankie. Kaia! Would you like to share with the group today?

[We pan up from her hands to see Kaia, her face shadowed behind her hair and a hoodie]
Kaia: Not much to say, you know. Just...one day at a time. Every day's a gift. Like the kitten poster says, hang in there baby.
Second Man: And the... uh, the incident...are you ready to discuss that?
Kaia: No.
Man: Kaia, you overdosed. You were found unconscious in an abandoned tenement with enough prescription amphetamine in your system to kill a small rhino. Not to mention the stolen pills the police found in your bag.
Kaia: I didn't steal them. I bought them.
Man: Yeah, from a dealer.
Kaia: I don't know, I like to think of him as a small businessman just trying to make it in Trump's America. [People in the group smile. A few laugh softly.]
Man: (sighs) The court sent you here to get better, but if you don't wanna talk about this, then we can't–
Kaia: I am talking about it. See? Lips? Moving? [Indistinct conversations in distance. We see scars running across Kaia's forearm.]
Man: Let's talk about your scars.
Kaia: Pass.
Man: Kaia.
Kaia: Look, I know you're just trying to do your job or whatever, but please stop. You don't know anything about me.
Man: I know you need help.
Kaia: I don't. I– I don't... I don't belong here. I'm not an addict. [PA tone sounds, with a garbled announcement]
Man: We've all been exactly where you are, Kaia. Denying the truth of our situation.
Kaia (loudly and angrily): I hate doing this to myself, putting that junk in my body, but it's the only thing that keeps me awake. (Kaia's voice begins to break, and she crushes the cup in her hands) It's the only thing that... that keeps me from... from the bad place. [The people around her agree solemnly.]
Man: Yes, we've all... we all have our bad places, don't we? The stuff were running from, the things that we try to blot out with drugs or drink. But we have to face it eventually, don't we? [Kaia looks at him, worried.]

[As the meeting disperses, Jack walks up to Kaia beside the circle of now-empty chairs]

Jack: Hey.
Kaia: Hey there!

Jack: I'm Jack.

Kaia looks at him clueless. Jack smiles.

ACT II

[Interior: the group therapy room at the facility where Kaia's being treated. Jack has extended his hand in greeting. Kaia doesn't shake it.]

Kaia: Hi Jack. You're new.
Jack: Yes, I am.

Kaia: So? What's your poison? [Jack looks at her blank, not understanding the question.]
Kaia: Why are you here?

Jack: I like... cocaine.

Kaia: Okay, Suite Life. Well, I don't know why you're really here, but you're gonna have to find a new day one buddy, 'cause that's not really my thing. [She walks away from Jack towards the coffee table and sets down her cup]
Jack: I know who you are, Kaia. I'm a... friend of Derek's. He told me about you. Said you were like him. [Kaia looks at Jack in shock, and Jack leans in and lowers his voice to a whisper.] A dreamwalker.

[Kaia hastily backs away from Jack and looks around to make sure no one is listening]
Kaia: What?
Jack: He said you were the most powerful one he'd ever known. And I need your help.
Kaia: Look, I– I don't know what you think you know about dreamwalking–
Jack: And I can help you. I can get you out of here.
Kaia: How?
Jack: Follow me.

[Through the window where Jack and Kaia had just been standing, we see Sam and Dean pull up at the center. They get out of the car and walk toward the building].

Sam: So... Kaia never knew her father. Her mom died in an accident when she was 12, so her aunt took her in and then she died– cancer

Dean: Damn.

Sam: Yeah, been on her own ever since, until her OD and arrest.

Dean: Bad hand.

Sam: Yeah.

Dean: No wonder she ended up here.

[Inside the building, Kaia glances backwards nervously as Jack leads her through the corridors. She sees the man who ran the earlier meeting. The man is surprised to see her walking in that part of the building]
Man: Kaia, where're you going?
Jack: Keep walking.
Man: Hey, you're not allowed to be in here.
[Jack touches his fingertips to the man's forehead and he collapses to the floor with a grunt. Kaia is shocked. She stops walking and looks at the man on the floor]

Kaia: What did you do?

Jack: Don't worry. He's just sleeping. You're not the only one with powers.

[Jack turns and starts to walk towards the exit. Kaia looks at the man on the floor and at Jack's retreating back. She runs after Jack. Jack breaks several locks on the door and steps outside, followed by Kaia. She sees the broken locks on the ground]

Kaia: That door was triple locked.
Jack: Was it?
Kaia: What are you?
Jack: That's a long story. This way.

[He's entirely matter-of-fact, and gestures for Kaia to come ahead. Kaia steps around him and backs away]

Kaia: Yeah, no.
Jack: What?
Kaia: Look, thanks for the jailbreak and all, but I don't know you, and I don't know what the hell's going on, so I'm out.

Jack: No, we had a deal.
Kaia: You said you'd get me out. That's the deal I heard.
Jack: You can't.
Kaia: Watch me.
Jack: No.
[He grabs her arm just as she turns to walk away, and his cheerful tone becomes forceful]
Jack: You will help me. [The previously broken door slams open and Sam and Dean walk out.]
Sam: Jack!
Jack: Sam?

[With Jack distracted, Kaia kicks him to the ground. He lets go of her arm. She then proceeds to punch him on the jaw and then runs away. Jack grunts in pain. He gets up and is baffled.]

Jack: She hit me.
Dean: Yeah, good.
Jack: No! She's getting away. I– she can't–
[Sam and Dean grab him from both sides. Jack tries to break free to run after Kaia.]
Dean: No no no no no. Hey, we're not letting you near her until you tell us whats going on.
Jack: No, I need her.
Sam: You need her like you needed Derek?
Jack: Yes.
[Sam and Dean let go of Jack. They exchange worried glances]
Jack: You don't... I'm– I'm doing this for you.
Dean: Oh, you killed Derek for us?
Jack: Derek's dead?
Sam: Wait, hold on a second. Jack, tell us what happened. Everything.
Jack: I left to try to get a grip on my powers. I wanted to prove to you that I'm good, to do one good thing. So I did the thing you wanted the most. I experimented opening doors to other worlds. I could almost do it. I could get right to the edge. But I couldn't see. I could only feel around in the dark. I needed eyes. A seer.

Sam: A dreamwalker.
Jack: Yeah. So I researched, like you taught me. That's how I found Derek.
[Flashback to the first scene where Jack visits Derek at his studio]

Jack: Hello.

[We see Derek getting ready for the ritual while Jack narrates to Sam and Dean]

Jack: I didn't know if it would work, but it did. He dreamwalked and I joined him... in the Apocalypse World.

[We see Derek's dreamwalk through the Apocalypse World, flashing between his vision and the art studio where Jack was sharing his vision]

Jack: I could see what he saw. And I saw...

[We enter the Apocalypse World church, and through the broken wall where the crucifix hangs we see Mary, now imprisoned in the iron maiden. Back in Derek's studio, Jack releases Derek from the vision, and Jack crouches at his side to aid him as he recovers]

Jack: No. I- I'm– I'm sorry. I- I didn't mean to...

[Back in present time with the Winchesters]

Jack: And I saw her.

Sam: Her?
Jack: Your mother.
[Sam and Dean are stunned into silence with the revelation.]

Jack: She's alive.

Dean: What?

Jack: But she is in danger.

Sam: W-what does that mean? What– what kind of danger?

Jack: It's easier if I show you.

[Jack holds his hands out, offering to show them what he's seen with his powers. Dean leans away, wary of what Jack intends to do to them.]

Dean: Wh–

Sam: Dean?

[Jack places his hands on Sam and Dean's temples. His eyes glow yellow, as do Sam and Dean's. We again see the Apocalypse World, and Mary groaning in pain]

Mary: Help. Help. Help! Somebody help me!

Dean: Mom.

[As Jack talks to Sam in the background, Dean turns away from them as if the rest of the world is blurring out around him. Even Sam and Jack's voices are muffled, and Dean stares blankly in shock]

Jack: I was so close to her. I could've touched her. But, Derek wasn't strong enough to hold the connection.

Sam: Wait! You didn't burn him out?

Jack: No, I stopped. Derek, he wasn't strong enough, but he knew someone who was. Kaia, she's the key.

[Exterior, a roadside. Kaia's thumb is extended, and we zoom out to see her walking backward down the road as a car stops to pick her up. A woman gets out of the car to help open the back door for her]

Woman: Where you headed, Miss?

Kaia: Anywhere.

Woman: Let me help you. Door's a little... hinky.

[The woman struggles to open the door, as she does, we see the driver has an angel blade on the seat beside him. The door opens.]

Woman: That's it.

[Kaia begins to get in the car, but the woman hits her on the back of her head with her own angel blade and shoves an unconscious Kaia into the back. The female angel then sits back in the car and they drive off.]

ACT III

[Exterior, flashes of black and white, we move between white tree branches and see a forest in the darkness. In a confusing series of clips, we see what appears to be strange skeletons on the forest floor, someone being stabbed with a spear, perhaps Jody. The scene flickers through multiple stabbings, Jody's face, and what appear to be Sam and Dean looking on in horror. The scene in the forest breaks up, finally flickering back to Patience, as car horn blares from behind her. She comes to in the parking lot of her school, halfway into a parking spot. Someone shouts, "Hey, get moving! Come on!" Patience reverses her car and drives away.]

[Interior, an abandoned building. Kaia is tied to a chair. She regains consciousness with a gasp. She struggles to get free. She turns and sees the female angel entering the room]

Female Angel: We want Jack.

Kaia: Cocaine boy?

Female Angel: The son of Lucifer.

Kaia: What the f–?

Female Angel: We tracked him to Derek, but the artist was uncooperative. We tortured him. Eventually, he told us where Jack was headed– to you.

Male Angel: Then we killed him.

Female Angel: Due diligence covering our tracks, yet the Winchesters got involved anyway, as they do. So we needed a new strategy.

[Kaia and the female angel look at each other.]

Female Angel: We needed bait.

[Interior, the Impala. Sam's cell phone beeps. We pan to see a serious Dean driving the car. Jack is in the backseat.]
Sam: Yep, all right. Thank you. [he hangs up the phone] Cops are looking for Kaia, too. We gotta find her fast.

Dean: You were right. About Mom. You were right. This whole time, we should've been looking for her.

Sam: Dean, I was just hoping. I didn't know. Anyways, it doesn't matter. Now that we do know–

Dean: We find her, no matter what it takes.

Sam: Yep.

Dean: Kid, you okay?

Sam: Jack?

Jack: You thought... You both thought that I could do that, that I could kill Derek.

Sam: Jack, we, um... We didn't know what happened. We figured, m-maybe it was an accident or– or...

Jack: Like the security guard.

Sam: Yes. Exactly. Like that. Jack, we were worried, okay? You know, when you disappeared, you were in a dark place. And we didn't know where you were going and...

Dean: Thought you were looking for your dad.

Jack: You mean Lucifer?

Dean: Mm.

Sam: Yeah.

Jack: I was scared. I was upset. But... why would I look for him? He's no one to me. You, Castiel– you're my family.

Dean: Yes, we are. Finding Mom, you... You did a good thing, kid. You did a real good thing.

[High-pitched ringing leaves Jack groaning in pain and clutching his head. Angel radio. Dean slams on the brakes and the Impala screeches to a halt.]

Jack: Ah!

Sam: Jack?

[The ringing noise stops]

Jack: That... It was angel radio. They've got Kaia.

[Interior: Patience Turner's room. She's packing a bag and getting ready to leave.]

James: What about school?

Patience: I'll miss a few days. No big deal.

James: Patience...

Patience: Someone... A friend's in danger. [Sighs] They're going to be in danger.

James: You had a vision.

Patience: They never stopped. I see things before they happen. Usually small things– a conversation, what someone will be wearing the next day. I tried pushing them down, ignoring them. But now? I can't. Dad... this is who I am.

James: No. If you get involved in that... Look, I was wrong to lie about Grandma. But you know what happened to her.

Patience: You raised me to do what's right, and this is what's right. If I don't go, people will die.

James: Patience, don't. You go now, you choose that life, you don't come back.

[Exterior, abandoned warehouse. The male angel steps outside to patrol the perimeter. Interior: abandoned warehouse. The female angel still has Kaia restrained to a chair]

Kaia: Your plan? It sucks. They won't come for me.

Female Angel: What do you mean?

Kaia: I mean, you picked the wrong bait. I'm not the kind of girl folks come for. In this world, I don't even rank a milk carton. No one is gonna come for me. I'm not white, rich, blonde. No one's gonna fight for me. I don't matter.

Female Angel: Of course you don't matter. But they think you do. They'll show. And when they do, we'll kill them and take the boy.

Dean: That so?

[Dean enters the warehouse, shoving the male angel in front of him while holding an angel blade to his throat. Sam and Jack follow behind.]

Dean: You know, the girl's right. Your plan does kind of suck.

Sam: Give us the girl.

Female Angel: She's not what we want. Jack, I don't wanna hurt you. I wanna help you. You should be among your own kind.

Jack: My kind? The kind that kills people? That kidnaps people?

Female Angel: You don't belong with them. Come with us. Come home.

[Jack glances around at Sam and Dean]

Jack: I am home.

[The male angel grabs Dean's wrist with the angel blade, and headbutts Dean. The female angel drops her blade into her hand, but Jack's eyes glow yellow and he holds the angel with his power, levitating her and throwing her across the warehouse, through a window and a wall as Kaia watches on, stunned. Sam clambers to retrieve Dean's dropped angel blade, but the male angel reaches it first, punching Sam backward across the floor. The male angel is inches away from stabbing Dean in the chest with the blade when Jack freezes him with his power, forcing the angel's hand to turn so he's pointing the blade at his own chest. The moment Jack releases him, the angel stabs himself and falls to the ground, dead. Sam and Dean scramble to their feet.]

Dean: I got her.

[Dean picks up the dropped angel blade and runs after the female angel that Jack had flung from the warehouse, while Sam and Jack run to assist Kaia]

Jack: Are you okay?

Kaia: No! What the hell was that?!

Jack: They were angels. Bad angels.

Kaia: Angels?

Sam: Yes, and we're hunters. We kill things like them.

Kaia: Right. And he's the Son of Satan?

[Sam shrugs]

Jack: I am. Yes.

Kaia: You're insane.

Dean: Yeah, the whole world's insane. You get used to it. She took off. She might be back, she might not.

Sam: Yeah, we should move.

[A train whistle blows in the distance as they exit the warehouse]

Jack: We'll protect you.

Kaia: I don't think so.

Sam: Wait. Hey, hey. Kaia, look, I'm sure this is a lot. But... [Sighs] Look, we need you. Okay? My brother and I, our– our mother is trapped in– in another world, and– and if you can tell Jack where it is, then he can open a door–

Dean: And we can save her.

[Sam sighs]

Dean: So what's the play?

Jack: Derek said there are sacred sites, places where the walls between worlds are thin, where it's easy to cross over. I was taking Kaia to the Wind Caves.

Kaia: The Wind Caves?

Dean: Let's roll.

Kaia: No.

Dean: We just saved your life in there.

Kaia: Thanks, but they only wanted me because of you.

Jack: Kaia, we need you to dreamwalk for us, to use your gift.

Kaia: It's not a gift. It's a curse. When Derek walked, he was free. He could go see beautiful things, to worlds that were paradises. I wish it was like that for me, but it's not. I only go to one place– the Bad Place. It's just... blood and death and monsters.

Dean: Well, it sounds like a lifetime of bad dreams, but–

Kaia: Bad dreams? [Kaia pulls up her sleeve, revealing several long scars] When I get hurt over there, I don't wake up sweaty. I wake up bloody. This scar, it's not the only one. I'm sorry about your mom, but I can't help you.

Sam: All right, fine. Um... we can find another way. We, um...

[Dean pulls out his gun and cocks it, Kaia looks scared]

Dean: Get in the car.

Sam: Dean. Dean.

Dean: Get in the car. [Dean snaps and yells, advancing on Kaia and raising his gun] Get in the damn car! [Kaia is afraid, but she relents] We're going to South Dakota.

ACT IV

[Interior, night in the Impala as Dean drives, Kaia is withdrawn and terrified in the back seat beside Jack]

Sam: So now what? We get Kaia to the Wind Caves, and then what? Force her to dreamwalk at gunpoint?

Dean: We get Mom back, no matter what. Remember?

[Another car – the angels' car from earlier – drives down the same highway, its headlights off. Back in the Impala, Jack tries to comfort Kaia]

Jack: I'm sorry... about all of this. I was like you, Kaia, afraid of my powers. But it doesn't have to be like that. You said that you wished that things could've been different, and that's why you reached out to Derek. Derek thought that you could help me, and I could help you.

Kaia: Why do you keep saying his name? Derek's dead because of you.

Jack: Five seconds.

Kaia: What?

Jack: Give me five seconds to show you what Derek saw, what I saw with him. It wasn't just the Bad Place. It was... everything. It's... amazing.

Kaia: Five seconds.

[Jack touches his fingers to Kaia's temple and her eyes glow gold as a look of wonder crosses her face at the vision Jack implants in her mind]

Jack: Our powers can be good. We can do good in this world.

[The car without headlights approaches head on, on the wrong side of the road. Dean squints into the dark to see it when the headlights come on, blinding him and Sam. He swerves to avoid a collision, and ends up turned around on the road. The other car turns back toward them]

Dean: Oh, crap.

[Dean steers the Impala down the side road into the Larsen Bros Shipyard, which is marked CLOSED. They pull to a stop beside a huge rusted out ship and get out of the Impala. Dean gets a bag of gear and weapons from the trunk and tosses it to Sam.]

Sam: Okay, let's go. Let's go! Out, out, out, out. Jack, come on.

Dean: Hey! Get 'em in the boat.

[High-pitched ringing sounds, and Jack bends over, clutching his head in pain against the assault of angel radio]

Jack: Aah!

Sam: Come on! Go, go, go! Come on! Go!

[Sam, Jack, and Kaia race up the gangway and into the ship, while Dean readies himself by the Impala to face down the female angel, who pulls up a moment later and gets out of her car]

Female Angel: Need that boy, Dean Winchester. Heaven's running out of angels. Only he can save us.

Dean: As far as I'm concerned, you dicks can fry.

Female Angel: Yes, well, you first.

[Two additional cars full of angels pull up behind the female angel, so Dean takes off running toward the boat]

[Interior: the rusting hull of an old ship, Kaia stands at a loss while Sam paints warding sigils on the walls]

Kaia: What's happening?

Jack: Don't worry. We'll be fine.

Dean [entering the room]: We're screwed. There's too damn many of 'em! We gotta go up. Let's go!

[Dean leads them all up a flight of stairs, while outside we see six angels calmly walking down the gangplank toward the ship. Inside, Sam stops to spray paint additional warding sigils]

Dean: How long will this warding hold?

Sam: I don't know.

[Sam finishes the sigil, and the run up another flight of stairs as the angels stand on the dock outside the warding. Sam, Dean, Kaia, and Jack have reached the end of the line and can go no farther. Sam paints more wards on the doors]

Sam: Hey, Dean, maybe if we let 'em in and then we blast them all away.

Dean: No, they get in here, we're dead.

[Outside, the angels crouch down and place the tips of their blades on the ground]

Dean: Jack, can you do anything?

Jack: I can try, but they'll hit me with angel radio again.

[Outside, the angels coordinate their power, slamming their hands to the ground and releasing a shock wave that blasts away at the warding sigils, shaking the entire ship]

Dean: Okay, all right, so then we go out guns blazing. We take out as many as we can. Kid, sorry to drag you into this. This was not your fight.

[Outside, the angels repeat their assault on the sigils, and the boat shakes again]

Jack: If they get up here, they'll kill you all and take me.

Kaia: No, they won't. You said I could help you find the door to another world, right?

Jack: Yes.

[The angels attack the sigil again]

Kaia: Let's do it. Let's get out of here.

Sam: Hey, can you take us to our mom?

[The angels attack again]

Dean: Can you do it?!

Jack: I don't know. I think so.

Sam: What if something goes wrong?

[The boat shakes again]

Dean: Something already is going wrong! Jack, do it.

[It shakes again multiple times as Kaia sits down and Jack stands behind her, ready for her to dreamwalk]

Jack: Are you ready?

Kaia: No. Let's go.

[The angels continue to attack, and the ship rattles and shakes continually. Jack places his fingertips on Kaia's temples and his eyes glow, and we see a blue forest, reminiscent of the one we saw in Patience's vision before]

Kaia: Okay, I'm there. I'm in the Bad Place.

[The forest floor is littered with bones, and a huge monstrous skull. The angels continue to attack outside, but Jack and Kaia try to remain focused]

Jack: Let go.

[Back in Kaia's Bad Place, a creature chitters and runs from tree to tree through the fog.]

Kaia: I can't.

Jack: Yes. You can.

[The angels attack again outside, but back in the Bad Place, the creature approaches, but Kaia is able to let go and Jack zooms out of the Bad Place to reveal a veritable galaxy of alternate universes. He looks through them, seeing one with a waterfall before finding the Apocalypse World and zooming in to it]

Jack: There.

[The angels attack again, and the warding sigils are almost completely breached.]

Sam: Dean, you gotta see this. Come here!

Dean: Jack, now!

[Inside Kaia's vision, we see Mary, still in the iron maiden]

Jack: I see her.

[The angels send several more attacks against the wards]

Sam: All right, they're almost through.

[Thunder claps in Kaia's vision, and it snaps back to her Bad Place]

Jack: [Gasps] No! [To Kaia] Focus.

[Her vision switches back to Mary, and then to the monstrous skull, where someone carrying a spear crosses in front of it, revealing its huge size]

Kaia: I'm losing it!

Jack: Almost. Almost!

[The scene shifts within Kaia's vision from the Apocalypse World to the Bad Place several times, as we see the angels step up their attacks for a final assault on the wards, until a dark, hooded figure comes face to face in the Bad Place, and Kaia begins screaming, amplified by Jack's power still flowing through her. With her first scream, the entire interior of the boat glows brightly. Her second scream blows the six angels outside to dust. Her third scream fills the entire room with a blinding light, tearing open a glowing portal. Aside from the portal, the room is now empty, silent.]

ACT V

[Interior, Jody's house, where she's attempting to reach Sam on the phone, but has only reached his voice mail]

Jody: Hey! Sam, could you call me back? [There's a knock on her door, but Jody finishes leaving the message] I just need to know you're okay.

[Jody disconnects the call and opens the door to find Patience Turner]

Jody: Patience?

Patience: Jody, I... I had a vision. Something bad's coming.

[Back at the shipyard, the wind blows as we see angel wings scorched onto the side of a building, and an angel blade melted to the ground. Inside the hull of the ship, the portal still glows brightly. A short distance away, in the brush at the side of the road, Kaia lies unconscious.

[In the Apocalypse World, we begin at Mary's wedding ring on the chain around her neck. She looks down beneath her cage to see Jack waking up.]

[In Kaia's Bad Place, Dean groggily wakes up and gets to his feet, his angel blade clutched in his hand]

Dean: Sam?

Sam (waking up a few feet from Dean): Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Dean: Hey.

Sam: No, no, no, I'm good.

Dean: Ah!

[They look around warily, trying to figure out where they are]

Dean: Come on.

[They walk through the forest, then jump down into a ditch]

Dean: Where the hell are we?

[We zoom out to see it's not a ditch they're standing in, but a massive footprint. As Sam and Dean look around, climb out the other side of the footprint and walk away, a large creature roars, and heavy footsteps approach.]
