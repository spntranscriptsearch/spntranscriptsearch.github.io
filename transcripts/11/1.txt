Act One
Ext. Dean is surrounded by the Darkness cloud that was hurtling toward the car. He looks around wildly until a woman appears in front of him.

DEAN: Hey! The hell's going on?!


Ext. The camera finds Sam unconscious in the Impala, horn blaring.

SAM: (groans when he touches his face where Dean hit him) Ah! (Sam looks around and the scene of the Darkness coming out of the ground and rushing toward the car replays)

DEAN: Hold on!

SAM: (Dean disappears from the car) Dean?! Dean?!

SAM: (coming out of his reverie, he looks around) Dean?


Ext. Field of Flowers. The camera pans over and Dean is unconscious on the ground. Sam comes walking up the hill and sees Dean on the ground.

SAM: Hey! Hey! (Dean wakes, groans, and stands up.) You okay?

DEAN: Yeah. Where's the car?

SAM: I-i-it's . . . About a mile that way.

DEAN: What?

SAM: Seriously? The -- the darkness hit. You disappeared. You remember none of this?

Dean thinks back to the Darkness hitting.

DEAN: Hold on! (Dean sees the woman from the Darkness outside the car, and then he’s standing in front of her, outside in the cloud.)

DEAN: (Out of his memory) She saved me.

SAM: What? Who?

DEAN: The Darkness.


TITLE SCENE

SAM: Wait a second. What do you mean, she saved you?

DEAN: You were there. When the storm hit, everything went dark.

SAM: Yeah, but you just disappeared from the car.

DEAN: I don't even remember that.

SAM: Well, I don't remember some woman pulling you out.

DEAN: Well, what do you want me to say, okay? I was in the car, and then I wasn't in the car. I was in the field, and she was there.

SAM: And she told you she was the darkness.

DEAN: No. She was wearing a nametag. What do you think? She thanked me.

SAM: For what?

DEAN: Setting her free.

SAM: You didn't set her free. I set her free.

DEAN: Does it matter? I mean, yeah, you said the spell, but I had the Mark, so lock and key.

SAM: So, what, now she feels indebted to you or something?

DEAN: I don't know. She's a Darkness. Does she feel anything?

SAM: And that's all she said? Thanks?

DEAN: Yeah. She was weird. But she had this energy about her, this -- this focus. But, yeah, not a talker.

SAM: So we know jack.

DEAN: Well, we know what she looks like, and we know that she's evil. The question is, what does she know? I mean, she's been locked away since the beginning of time. Does she even know what a cheeseburger is? All I know is that we set her free, and we're gonna put her back in, no matter what it takes. (Dean gets in the car, which is still stuck down in the pothole.) What the . . . Just gonna let me get in the car?

SAM: You were on a roll.


Ext. Camera pans on a shack in the middle of the woods. Castiel is crouched inside, remembering his altercation with Crowley. He flashes back to the building where Rowena left them.

CROWLEY: (as Castiel approaches) Don't! Please! (he blocks Castiel’s blow) You think you can kill me? You execrable -- (Castiel knocks Crowley onto the ground and stabs him with an angel blade.)


Ext. A hunter and two kids examine a dead dog on the property where Castiel is hiding. They split up to search the buildings. The camera flashes to Castiel who again remembers killing Crowley. But this time, the scene portrays Crowley smoking out of his meatsuit and escaping. The scene then returns to Castiel.

CASTIEL: No. He's still alive. (The door opens and the youngest of the three steps in, holding a shotgun on Castiel.) Don't make me hurt you. Do you hear me? I can't help myself. You have to run. (Castiel escapes)


Ext. Sam and Dean are in the Impala driving down the road when they come upon a gruesome scene.

DEAN: What the hell happened here?

SAM: (at a sound from behind them) Hello?

DEAN: (at the approaching creepy guy) Oh, that's not a happy sight. Hey, easy, buddy. Just stay cool till we figure out what's going here, okay? (creepy guy approaches) Kind of narrowing my options here.

SAM: We don't even know what he is.

A deputy shoots the creepy guy from behind and points her weapon at Sam and Dean.

DEPUTY (JENNA): Weapons on the ground. Slow.

DEAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, officer. We're FBI, okay? We got badges.

JENNA: (pumping shotgun) Don't. Show me some skin.

DEAN: Huh?

SAM: What?

JENNA: Both of you.

DEAN: Is this, like, a "Magic Mike" moment?

JENNA: Your throats!

SAM: Oh, you think we're -- we're . . . Look, we don't even know what these are.

JENNA: I need to know you're not one of 'em.

DEAN: One of what?

JENNA: Let's go!

DEAN: Okay, all right, look. Huh? See?

JENNA: Good. Let's see those IDs.

DEAN: Yeah, whoa. All right, take -- take it easy, okay? (gesturing to the deputy’s wound) Bad guys?

JENNA: Rebar. I sought cover. I fell.

DEAN: Okay. Why don't you tell us what happened here?

JENNA: 911 reported a family in distress. I arrived to find several hostiles attacking said family. Oh, God, it was horrible.

DEAN: How long you been on the job, deputy?

JENNA: Uh . . . Okay, three weeks.

DEAN: Okay, ah. I'm Dean. This is Sam. Just breathe. Okay? Speak plain. What happened?

JENNA: They killed them all.

SAM: Who?

JENNA: Road crew. It was -- they were like rabid dogs. I fired off a warning, but they didn't stop. They . . .

DEAN: You killed all these?

JENNA: I knew some of the boys, but they didn't look -- something was wrong. They were . . .

SAM: They're not human.

DEAN: Hey, look, I can stitch that up, but, uh, it's gonna be ugly. You got a hospital around here?

JENNA: Up the road.

DEAN: All right. Here we go.


Ext. Sam, Dean, and Jenna drive up to the hospital, which does not look encouraging. They get out of the car and enter the hospital.

DEAN: Well, this is encouraging. (gesturing to Jenna) Wait here.

SAM: So, what are you thinking?

DEAN: I don't really know what to think. And I don't know what to expect either, so I'm just gonna chuck it all in.

SAM: This is the darkness, right? It's got to be.

DEAN: So, what, she shows up and everybody goes "28 Days Later"? We didn't.

SAM: Yeah, but I was in the car, and you were -- you said she protected you. So, I mean maybe it wasn't her. Maybe it was the smoke, and anybody who was outside, like the road crew, they were exposed. I mean, you saw that. That wasn't human.

DEAN: So, what? The smoke mutated 'em? Sure, why not? Just a couple hours ago, I killed Death. I'm pretty much open for anything. But mutated into what? All right, you know what, one thing at a time. Let's just get her some help and then we'll deal with whatever comes next.

JENNA: I got to call this in. (referring to the destruction and bodies all over the hospital)

DEAN: No, bad idea. More people, more bodies. We'll deal with this.

SAM: You know what, Dean, I'm gonna take a look around. You sew her up. (Sam walks off on his own)

DEAN: All right. You know this place?

JENNA: This way.

DEAN: Okay.


Int. hospital hallway. Sam sneaks down a hallway and finds a one of the road crew trying to break its way into a supply closet. It approaches where Sam is hiding, but then a baby cries and it goes back to pounding on the closet.


Int. hospital exam room with Dean and Jenna. Dean is prepping supplies to sew Jenna up.

DEAN: This is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch.

JENNA: I knew those boys' sisters, their parents.

DEAN: You did what you were trained to do. It's all right.

JENNA: They don't train you to shoot your friends. I panicked. I could have . . .

DEAN: Those boys weren't boys. They were monsters, and they were a threat. Anybody could have panicked. Not anybody could have done what you did.

JENNA: This job is supposed to be saving people.

DEAN: Yeah, well . . . It sounds better on paper, doesn't it?


Ext. Darkness Cloud Flash back: Dean is back in the cloud with the Darkness.

DEAN: Well, now that you've said your thanks, let's talk about what happens next.

DARKNESS: I like it here. With you. I haven't felt this peaceful in a long, long time.

DEAN: Well, let's get something straight -- I'm not here to bring you peace. I know what you are.

DARKNESS: Really? I've been gone so long, I didn't think anyone remembered.

DEAN: Well, Death painted a hell of a picture.

DARKNESS: I don't know this death, and he doesn't know me.

DEAN: (holding up a knife) So, are you saying I shouldn't try and kill you right now?

DARKNESS: Am I saying that? Or are you?


Int. hospital hallway. Sam is hiding behind the desk, when he hears a large crash. Peeking around the corner, the road crew monster has collapsed and died. Sam knocks on the door of the closet.

SAM: Hello? Hello?

MAN IN CLOSET: Is he dead?

SAM: Yeah, um . . . Yeah, he's dead. It's okay to come out. I'm, uh, FBI. Here. I'm gonna slide my badge under the door, okay?

(the door opens and a man with an infant comes into the hallway)

MAN: Help us, please.


Ext Residential neighborhood. Red smoke comes pouring out of a sewer and flows into an SUV parked on the street. A woman gets out and goes to unload her groceries, only to have Crowley possess her. He snaps his fingers, but nothing happens.

CROWLEY: Bollocks. Hmm. Old-school it is. (he picks up the tire iron and goes into the house.)

CROWLEY: Vanilla spice?

MAN: Marn? Down here!

CROWLEY: Hmm. (walks down the stairs to find three people waiting) What's going on?

MARN’S HUSBAND: You just sit your tush down, okay? Just let me get this out. I've been thinking a lot about what you said -- and -- and I know, I lost my chickens when you put it out there. But it's not every day that your wife tells you that she wants to watch you get a party started with your best friends. I mean, am I right?

CROWLEY: Hmm. Go on.

MARN’S HUSBAND: So, I slept on it and I prayed on it, and then it came to me. YOLO.

CROWLEY: YOLO?

DALE: "You only live once."

CROWLEY: Don't.

DALE: Sorry.

MARN’S HUSBAND: So, I called Dale, and he said . . .

DALE: H-E-double-hockey-sticks yeah!

MARN’S HUSBAND: Dale ran it by Deb . . .

DEB: We were only gonna get buffet anyway.

MARN’S HUSBAND: And here we are. I didn't think I'd be this nervous, but . . .

DALE: Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry. We'll be gentle - not!

DEB: Oh, Dale!

MARN’S HUSBAND: Anyhoo, it's your day, birthday girl. You just say go, and, heck -- we will light this candle.

DEB: (noticing the tire iron) Marn? Everything okay with the car?

CROWLEY: Oh. It's fine. Just fine.


Int. Exam room in the hospital with Dean, Sam, Jenna, and the man with the baby, Mike.

MIKE: The doc said it was gonna be a tough birth, but Janie . . . she stepped up. The twister hit, the power went out. She just kept on going. No drugs. Just pushed out this little dewdrop like she was nothing. Then Janie started bleeding. They tried, but . . . You'd think they'd know how to stop something like that.

JENNA: I'm so sorry, Mike.

DEAN: You think you could tell us what happened here?

MIKE: I went outside, after . . . t’collect myself. A truckload of 'em pulled up.

SAM: The road crew?

MIKE: They didn't say nothing. They just went off, attacking folks like they were possessed. I tore back inside to get this little one. I found that supply closet, and you know, been there since. I could hear them, though. Tearing through the halls. Doctors, nurses -- they didn't care.

SAM: You said the road crew went nuts. Did any of them come after you?

MIKE: Yeah, a few of them.

SAM: Did they cut you or bleed on you?

MIKE: They did.

JENNA: I don't understand. What are you saying?

DEAN: Saying that whatever this is, it might be transmittable.

JENNA: What? We don't even know what this is. Now you're saying it can be passed on?

MIKE: He's right. I can feel it. Inside. Something's happening.

DEAN: How long has it been since you were attacked?

MIKE: Three, four hours. The real question is, how long till I become like them?


Ext. road at night with cop cars and a big truck pull up. The camera pans back to show Castiel hiding in the trees. He gets down on his knees.

CASTIEL: Brothers, sisters . . . I know I have no right, I have no standing to ask you -- you anything, but these are desperate times, so ask I must. I confess my transgressions, and I will accept whatever punishment you dole out. Now, I . . . I ask you to help me. Please. Save me from doing worse.


Int. Exam room in the hospital. Dean, Sam, Mike, and Jenna continue their conversation.

DEAN: Well, you know where I stand.

JENNA: No, you're not . . . You can't be serious. And if he goes out there, they'll kill him.

DEAN: So, we just wait around for him to kill us? Oh, yeah, that's -- that's a plan.

SAM: Or we just wait for him to die. There was a -- whatever you want to call it -- a "rabid" attacking the closet door, and he just died. These things have a shelf life.

DEAN: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.

JENNA: No, he's right. We lock him up, we find a cure. This is a hospital.

DEAN: Yeah, well, call it a hunch, but I don't think you're gonna find this in the medical books.

MIKE: I didn't open up that closet door to find a cure.

DEAN: Look, Mike, I'm sorry, but this is untenable.

MIKE: I know. That's why I thought maybe we could make a deal. I'll go find somewhere quiet and lay low until this is over. And you save my baby girl.

DEAN: Yeah. You've got yourself a deal.

MIKE: And I thank you for that. I truly do. But I wasn't talking to you. (looks to Jenna) I know you. I've seen you in church since you were knee-high. Please. (gives the baby to Jenna)

JENNA: I don't even own a Guinea pig.

MIKE: There you go, little girl. There you go. Thank you. Thank you all. (Mike runs out of the room)

DEAN: Why do I get the feeling that that is gonna bite us in the ass? You good?

JENNA: Oh, yeah. Aces.

DEAN: All right, let's gear up.

SAM: That might be tricky. (Sam looks out the window and sees another car of rabids pull up)

JENNA: What's he doing?

SAM: Dean . . .

DEAN: We made a promise.

SAM: To do what? Charge out there, guns blazing? We don't even know how to kill them.

DEAN: She does. Chest, right? I'm guessing heart.

JENNA: This is madness.

DEAN: No. No, that is madness. This is horse sense.

JENNA: Save Mike's baby, but shoot Mike. Tell me where that makes sense.

SAM: Look, we can just wait for them to die.

DEAN: And how long is that? And when they infect others, how long is that? No, we stay here, that baby dies. We did this, Sam. Okay? We broke it, we bought it. You know there's no other way. (Dean’s phone rings) Where the hell are you, Cas?

(The scene flips between Sam and Dean at the hospital, and Castiel in the woods.)

CASTIEL: I'm...I'm okay.

DEAN: You don't sound okay.

CASTIEL: Dean, I am fine. Besides, what I have, you can't help me.

DEAN: What do you mean, what you have?

CASTIEL: Just please tell Sam -- Rowena escaped with the Book of the Damned and the codex.

DEAN: Okay, forget Rowena. Where are you?

CASTIEL: Now, you tell me -- the Mark . . .

DEAN: Oh, really? You're worried about me after everything that I’ve --

CASTIEL: Dean, is it gone?

DEAN: Yes. I'm good. I mean, I'm not great.

CASTIEL: Makes two of us. (Dean puts Cas on speakerphone) This is good news.

SAM: Hey, Cas.

CASTIEL: Sam.

DEAN: Okay, your turn. Talk to us about the darkness.

CASTIEL: Why would I talk about the darkness?

SAM: Because it's free.

CASTIEL: No, that can't be.

SAM: Removing the Mark opened some kind of lock. Dean saw her.

CASTIEL: The darkness is a woman?

DEAN: Well, that's what we're asking you. We were hoping you could tell us what kind of defcon screwed we are.

DEAN: Cas?

CASTIEL: (pauses at a sound in the woods behind him) Sam, Dean . . . Goodbye. It may be some time before we see one another again.

DEAN: Wait, Cas. Cas!

JENNA: FBI, my ass.

CASTIEL: (acknowledging the two angels standing with blades behind him) Brothers.


Int. Basement of Marn’s house. The bodies of Dale, Deb, and Marn’s husband are strewn around, and there is a large bowl of blood on the table. There is music playing, and two demon minions wait anxiously on Crowley.

MUSIC: It's not unusual to have fun with anyone but when I see you hanging about with anyone it's not unusual to see me cry I wanna die it's not unusual . . .

CROWLEY: Took you long enough.

MINION 2: We came as soon as you called s- ah . . . What do we call you?

CROWLEY: King. What about the other white meatsuit?

MINION 2: Secured. We have another team and a witch removing Rowena's immobilization spell as we speak.

CROWLEY: Hmm. Is anybody hot? I'm hot.

MINION 2: I believe that's the menopause, sir.

CROWLEY: Thank you. What!

MINION 1: Uh, it's nothing, sir.

CROWLEY: Speak.

MINION 1: It's just, you barely escaped assassination. You're arguably on the run from the most powerful witch on earth -- not to mention an angel of heaven and ah . . .

CROWLEY: And, ah . . . ?

MINION 1: Y-you didn't call for help until after the orgy?

CROWLEY: Hmp. I apologize . . . For nothing.


Int. Exam room in the hospital. Jenna soothes the baby while Sam and Dean argue.

SAM: Look, I get it. I do. We're gonna save that baby, okay? And we're gonna find Cas, and we're gonna stop the darkness.

DEAN: Okay, so what are we talking about?

SAM: The plan.

DEAN: We have a plan, okay? It's the same plan as it's always been. In order to get out, we go through.

SAM: And? How's that been working for us?

DEAN: We can't save Cas if we're stuck in some hospital, okay? Just like I can't strap on a time machine, go back, and tell Cain to shove that Mark up his ass or stop you from releasing the darkness. Now, have we made mistakes? Yes. Hell, yes. And we can analyze each and every one of them over a couple of frosties when we're old and farting sawdust and out of this room! Right now, all I can do is I can gear up, I can head out, and I can save that freaking baby, which is exactly what I'm gonna do.

SAM: When did we forget how to do this?

DEAN: What?

SAM: Dean, if we don't change -- right now -- all of our crap is just gonna keep repeating itself.

DEAN: Okay, I-I don't even -- what?

SAM: This -- this "kill first, question later." What happened to us? Hunting things -- we're good at that. Sure, we're great at that. But that's only half of the bumper sticker, man.

DEAN: Sam, I am trying to save that baby.

SAM: And what about the others out there?

DEAN: You mean the ones trying to kill us?

SAM: I mean the ones that are sick, the ones that are dying.

DEAN: Yeah, who won't rest until they've infected us all.

SAM: So we just forget about a cure?

DEAN: What cure? Jenna's cure? (holds up the shotgun)

SAM: There is always a cure. You just have to want to find it.

DEAN: Yeah, how are you gonna find it if you're dead? And around and around we go.

SAM: Saving people means all of the people, Dean. Not just that baby. Not just each other. I unleashed a force on this world that could destroy it . . . to save you.

DEAN: And I told you not to.

SAM: And I'd do it again. In a second, I would do it again. And that is what I'm talking about. This isn't on you. It is on us. We have to change.

DEAN: What are you thinking?

SAM: Get Jenna to the car. Get her and the baby somewhere safe.

DEAN: Without a shot. And what are we gonna do about those things on our tail?

SAM: They won't be on your tail.

DEAN: No way.

SAM: You said it, Dean. We broke this.

DEAN: Yeah, we broke this, okay? We did.

SAM: I heard it in your voice when you agreed to take that child. I get it. You do what you do. But you've got to let me do what I do, too.


Int. Another hallway in the hospital. Sam looks over the railing into the stairwell and calls to the rabids at the bottom.

SAM: Hey! (the rabids run up the stairs and chase Sam) Over here!

DEAN: Come on. (Dean and Jenna sneak out the other way)

SAM: Come and get me, you sons of bitches! (Sam locks himself in a supply closet. The rabids outside start pounding on the door. He turns around, to find he’s locked himself in with one; she attacks Sam. Sam slits her throat, gets her blood all over his face. The other rabids break down the door and pin him.) Don't do this. Let me help you. (They smell him, and then leave him alone.)


Int. the front desk of the hospital. Jenna and Dean have almost made it out of the hospital when they are stopped by Mike.

DEAN: Come on.

MIKE: The baby.

JENNA: No.

MIKE: The baby.

DEAN: No. We're not gonna hurt you, Mike. As long as you leave that baby alone. Mike.

MIKE: Amara.

JENNA: What?

MIKE: Her name . . . is Amara. (Mike keels over and dies; Jenna and Dean leave the hospital)


Int. the building where Crowley’s other meatsuit is. We see Crowley smoke back in and address his minions.

CROWLEY: Ahh. Daddy's home. What?

MINION 2: Sir . . . There are rumors from Hell.

CROWLEY: Rumors?

MINION 2The Darkness has been released.

CROWLEY: The Darkness? Please. Myth. It's a bedtime story. Something that daddy demons threaten toddler demons with to get them to eat their vegetables. Even if it was true, what's the concern? Darkness, King of Hell -- natural allies.

MINION 1: It's just -- something happened, sir . . . In the cage.

CROWLEY: What?

MINION Uh, they said it sounded like a frightened animal. All of hell heard -- like someone was going crazy. The rumor is that Michael or Lucifer -- one of them is trying to warn us.

CROWLEY: About the darkness. Ridiculous.

MINION 2: Except . . . Half of Hell is sort of freaking out, sir. What do we do?


Int. dungeon-like room. The two angels who picked up Castiel lead him in in chains. One of the angels speaks to him.

ANGEL: After Metatron escaped, we moved the door to heaven.

CASTIEL: Yeah, smart.

ANGEL: You know, to prevent further incidents.

CASTIEL: Of course. I would have done the same thing. Before we go back, we need to find a witch or someone who knows spellcraft to remove the . . . (the angel hangs Castiel’s chains from the ceiling) Ugh! I don't understand. You're not taking me to heaven.

OTHER ANGEL: No. We're not. (they cover his head with a hood)


Ext. Dean and Jenna pull into a gas station.

DEAN: Oh, you good?

JENNA: Yeah. Baby. Poop. What could go wrong?

DEAN: Godspeed.

JENNA: I have no idea what I'm doing.

DEAN: Right. Listen, I know things might seem dark right now -- hell, call it pitch-black. And you may not be able to see it, but your way back is right there. You and her. You're gonna help each other.

JENNA: Joy comes in the morning. My grandma leads a Bible study.

DEAN: Ah. Well, let's go with that.

(Dean pulls out his phone and calls Sam. The scene flips back and forth between the gas station and the supply closet where Sam’s still sitting.)

SAM: Hey, you good?

DEAN: Yeah, about 40 miles outside of town. As far as I can tell, it's isolated to Superior.

SAM: Well, that's something.

DEAN: How about you? You okay?

SAM: What'd you expect? Like it or not, I'm gonna find a cure.

DEAN: Yeah, I know you are. Man, things are screwy right now. I know we don't have any answers, but at least we got one win, you know?

SAM: I hear you.

DEAN: All right, I'm gonna run Jenna up to her grandmother's. Shouldn't be more than a few hours. Then we clean up that town. We find the Darkness, and we kick her ass.

SAM: Yeah, that's great, Dean. That um . . . sounds like a plan.


Ext. Dean is back in the cloud with the Darkness, remembering more of their conversation.

DEAN: If you're as bad as they say you are, why haven't you hurt me?

DARKNESS: For the same reason that you'll never hurt me. (She pulls aside her dress to show the Mark of Cain on her collarbone) We're bound, Dean. We'll always be bound. You helped me. I helped you. No matter where I am, who I am . . . We will always help each other.


Int. supply closet at the hospital. Sam get up and goes to look in the mirror. He pulls aside his shirt, and he has the same black marks starting on his chest that the rabids do.

Int. bathroom at the gas station. Jenna is changing Amara’s diaper. When she takes Amara’s onesie off, Amara has the Mark of Cain on her collarbone.
