TEASER

EXT. GROCERY STORE

DEAN (looks at address on a piece of paper, looks at awning of store in front of him) Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

INT. GROCERY STORE

DEAN Hi, I'm, uh, looking for...

EMPLOYEE Follow all the way back. All the way back.

(Dean goes to the back of the store and takes a series of steps up to an apartment)

DR. ROBERT Dean Winchester?

DEAN You must be Dr. Robert?

DR. ROBERT Son, I stitched up your daddy more times than I can count, let me tell you. Oh, it's good to see you. 'Course, that was ages ago, back when, uh, I still had my medical license. Right this way.

DEAN Well, you know, I'm, uh, I'm no germ freak, but...

DR. ROBERT Rent's cheap.

(Dean and Dr. Robert enter the doctor’s “office”

DR. ROBERT Eva, my assistant.

DEAN Hi.

DR. ROBERT Hop right up.

DEAN N-now, you -- you have, uh, done this a lot?

DR. ROBERT Oh, many, many times.

DEAN And your...success rate?

DR. ROBERT Oh, excellent --almost 75%. So, should we get the, uh, preliminaries out of the way?

DEAN Yeah. Uh, yeah, right. (hands Dr. Robert an envelope of money)

DR. ROBERT Ah. Oh.

DEAN Oh.Uh...So...listen, if, uh, something...

DR. ROBERT Goes wrong?

DEAN Yeah. Uh...Would you mail this for me, please? (Dean hands Dr. Robert a letter addressed to Ben)

DR. ROBERT Sure. Would've thought you had something for your brother, Sam.

DEAN If I don't make it back, nothing I say is gonna mean a damn thing to him.

(Eva inserts an IV needle)

DEAN Ahh!

EVA Don't be a baby.

DEAN You know, a little bedside manner would be nice.

DR. ROBERT Are we ready? Hmm?

DR. ROBERT You've got three minutes.

EVA No pulse, no sinus rhythm.

DR. ROBERT He's dead.

DEAN (walks up and sees his dead body)Good times. (Dean walks back out to the convenience store)This better work. Messorum evoco qui me tetigit.

TESSA Dean?What the hell?

DEAN What do you know? It worked.

TESSA I was in the Sudan! What's with yanking me ov--wait, why are you dead?

DEAN Tessa, I need a favor.

TESSA Oh, you're kidding. You died to ask me --

DEAN tell your boss I need to talk to him.

TESSA No.

DEAN Please?

TESSA Where do you get the nerve?

DEAN Desperate times.

TESSA He calls us. We don't call him.

DEAN You make an exception!

TESSA I can't.

DEAN Can't or won't?!

TESSA Both!

DEATH All right, Tessa. Thank you very much. Hello, Dean.


ACT 1

INT. GROCERY STORE

DEATH I'm busy, Dean. Talk fast.

DEAN I have something of yours.

DEATH You mean my ring? I recall loaning you that temporarily.

DEAN Well, if you want it back --

DEATH I'm sorry, you assume that I don't know where you've hidden it. Now we've established you have hubris but no leverage, what is it you want?

DEAN Lucifer's cage. I figure you're one of the few people that can actually jailbreak it.

DEATH Do you?

DEAN Sam's soul is stuck in that box.

DEATH I've heard.

DEAN And our other brother is trapped in there, too. Michael rode him in.

DEATH Dean, quit shuffling and deal.

DEAN I want you to get 'em both out.

DEATH Hmm. Pick one.

DEAN What?!

DEATH Sam's soul or Adam's.

DEAN But --

DEATH As a rule, I don't bring people back. I might make an exception once, not twice. So...Pick.

DEAN Sam. His soul has been in there for a year, and I understand that it's...Damaged.

DEATH Try flayed to the raw nerve.

DEAN Well, is there any way that you could, uh, I don't know, hack the hell part off?

(cut to Dr. Robert and Eva attempting to revive Dean)

EVA Four, three, two...now

DR. ROBERT Again.

DEATH Dean, Dean, Dean. What do you think the soul is? Some pie you can slice? The soul can be bludgeoned, tortured, but never broken. Not even by me.

DEAN Well, there's got to be something.

DEATH Maybe. Can't erase Sam's hell, but I can...put it behind a wall, if you will.

DEAN A "wall."

DEATH In his mind --a dam to hold back the tide. Nasty, those memories. You don't want to know what they'll do to him. Believe me.

DEAN Okay, uh, a wall. Sounds good.

TESSA But it's not permanent.

DEATH She's right. Nothing lasts forever. Well, I do, but...

DEAN Okay, so that's the choice -- Sam with no soul, or Sam with some drywall that if or when it collapses, he's...Done?

DEATH Yes.

DEAN Do it.

DEATH I never said I'd do it.

DEAN Well, then what the hell have we been talking about?

DEATH Your prize.If you win the wager.

DEA Great. What's the bet?

DEATH Don't roll your eyes, Dean. It's impolite. Now, when you fetch my ring, put it on.

DEAN What?

DEATH I want you to be me for one day.

DEAN Are you serious?

DEATH No, I'm being incredibly sarcastic.

(cut back to Dr. Robert and Eva)

DR. ROBERT Eva, adrenaline!

DEATH Take the ring off before the 24 hours are up, and you lose. No soul for Sam. Clear?

DEAN Okay. Yes. But...But why?

DEATH Simple, Dean. Because --

INT. DR. ROBERT'S OFFICE

DR. ROBERT Oh, thank Moses.

DEAN You couldn't have given me five more seconds?

DR. ROBERT Son, you were gone for seven minutes.

DEAN I was?

DR. ROBERT Mm-hmm. I thought for sure death had you by the twins.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE

SAM You what?!

DEAN Just hear me out.

SAM I heard Cas and Crowley when they said it would either kill me or turn me to jello, Dean! I heard enough!

DEAN Death said he can put up a wall.

SAM A wall?

DEAN Yes, yes, a wall --that -- that, basically, you wouldn't remember hell.

SAM Really?

DEAN Really.

SAM For good? Like a cure?

DEAN No, it's not a cure. It...He said it could last a lifetime.

SAM Great. So, playing pretty fast and loose with my life here, don't you think, Dean?

DEAN I'm trying to save your life!

SAM Exactly, Dean! It's my life! It's my life, it's my soul. And it sure as hell ain't your head that's gonna explode when this whole scheme of yours goes sideways!

BOBBY Just curious. I presume Death's not doing this out of the goodness of his heart. So what's your half of the deal?

(Dean looks evasive)

BOBBY I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

DEAN I have to wear the ring for a day.

BOBBY Why the hell would he want you to do that?

DEAN Get his rocks off. I don't know. But I'm doing it.

(Sam moves to leave)

DEAN Where you going?

SAM Look, I hear you, all right? I get it. I just need a minute to wrap my head around it, all right?

EXT. BOBBY'S YARD

(Sam looks at a small hole in the ground, worriedly)

DEAN (holding Death's ring) Looking for this?

SAM Just taking a walk.

DEAN Sam. I'm your brother. I'm not gonna let you get hurt. I know what I'm doing here.

SAM What if you're wrong?

DEAN I won't let it go wrong.

SAM Fine.

DEAN Fine? So, you're --

SAM So, I'm trusting you here. Barely.

DEAN You sure?

SAM You're the one with the compass, right? Just don't mess it up.

DEAN I won't. (to Bobby)Watch him.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE

SAM So, is this the part where you pull a gun on me and lock me in the panic room?

BOBBY Do I have to?

SAM No. I guess Dean's got to do what he's got to do.

BOBBY Guess we all do, kid.

EXT. BOBBY'S YARD

DEAN Well, here goes everything. (Dean puts on ring)

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET

TESSA Wow. They'll just let any slack-jawed haircut be Death these days.

DEAN Well, you're all charm today, aren't you?

TESSA Let's be clear so that we get through this with a minimum of screw-up. I don't like this. And right now, I'm not crazy about you, either.

DEAN This is your boss' idea, not mine.

TESSA True. But you have a long history of throwing a wrench in everything, so let's just stick to the rules. Deal?

DEAN And the rules are?

TESSA For the next 24 hours, you kill everyone whose number's up.

DEAN Well, how am I supposed to know who to...

TESSA Kill?

DEAN Yeah.

TESSA I have a list.

DEAN Let me see.

TESSA No. You touch them, they die, I reap them. Are we clear?

DEAN Yeah, I guess.

TESSA Remove the ring, you lose. Slack off, you lose.Got it?

DEAN Yeah.

TESSA Don't mess this up. It's not my job to be your damn babysitter.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

(Sam performs a summoning ritual)

BALTHAZAR Sam...Winchester. This had better be good.


ACT 2

BALTHAZAR Why here's one for the list of dumbest things ever. Summon the angel who wants to kill you.

SAM Desperate times. I need your help, Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR Interesting...Since last time we met, you wanted to --what was it? Oh, yes, yes --fry my wings "extra crispy."

SAM Well, that was a misunderstanding.

BALTHAZAR Some misunderstanding!

SAM I need some advice.

BALTHAZAR Advice?

SAM Angel advice.

BALTHAZAR Well, then go ask your boyfriend.

SAM Cas can't help me. I need to know if there's a spell or a weapon, anything that can keep a soul out -- forever.

BALTHAZAR Ohh. What's going on, Sam?

SAM It's for me.

BALTHAZAR Well. The plot thickens. Where's your soul, Sam? Good God, no. It's not still...It is.

SAM My brother found a way to put it back in me. I don't want it.

BALTHAZAR No, you don't. No, no, 'cause Michael and Lucy are hate-banging it as we speak.

SAM Can you help me?

BALTHAZAR Oh, yes. The question is, will I?

SAM Set your terms.

BALTHAZAR I'll do it for free.

SAM Free? Why?

BALTHAZAR Well, you seem like a capable young man. I'd love to have you in my debt. And I have to say, I'm not a fan of your brother, so screwing him would delight me. Anyway, to business. The spell, yes. So, finding the ingredients are easy enough, but, uh, there's one tricky part, however.

SAM Okay.

BALTHAZAR You need to scar your vessel.

SAM Meaning what?

BALTHAZAR Meaning something that so pollutes it, it renders it uninhabitable. Calls for something very specific.

SAM Great. What?

BALTHAZAR Patricide.

SAM My dad's been dead for years.

BALTHAZAR To be clear, um, you need the blood of your father, but your father needn't be blood. Comprende?

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET

TESSA Just so you know, when people die, they might have questions for you. Well, you know, not you, but death.

DEAN You mean like, "how did Betty White outlast me?"

TESSA "What's it all mean?" Is popular.

DEAN And am I just gonna magically know?

TESSA No.

DEAN Then what the hell am I supposed to say? Oh, come on, give me something.

TESSA Suck it up. Comes with the gig.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE

ROBBER (pointing gun at cashier, who is standing behind the register with his son)Come on! Come on! Let's go!

TESSA They can't hear you. They can't see you. Just let this play out.

DEAN Well, who am I taking?

TESSA Wait and see.

DEAN Which one?

ROBBER You want me to shoot the kid?! Hurry up! Oh, you think I'm kidding? And don't forget the drawer under the register. Come on, move it! Let's go!

(Cashier pushes a bag off the counter onto the floor, and while the robber bends to pick it up he pulls a gun out of the drawer under the register)

ROBBER You idiot.

(The cashier shoots the robber, who falls to the ground, dying)

TESSA Hello? Tick tock.

DEAN He's in agonizing pain, right?

TESSA Uh, yes.

DEAN Give me a minute.

(Dean touches the robber, whose soul appears behind him)

ROBBER'S SOUL Why?

DEAN Mostly because you're a dick. Enjoy the ride down, pal. Trust me -- sauna gets hot.

(Tessa walks out with Robber's soul)

DEAN That wasn't so hard.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF A CAFE

(Tessa and Dean approach a man eating pizza)

DEAN Call me crazy, but this smells like a heart attack.

(man clutches his chest and falls forward)

DEAN Lucky guess.

(Dean touches the man)

MAN'S SOUL Why?

DEAN You think maybe it was the extra cheese?

MAN'S SOUL Yeah. It was good, though.

DEAN Is that a local place?

TESSA Dean.

DEAN Right. Uh, time to go, man. Sorry.

MAN'S SOUL Wait. Will you tell me what it all means?

DEAN Everything is dust in the wind.

MAN'S SOUL That's it?! A Kansas song?!

TESSA Sorry. He's new.


INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE

(Sam enters the house)

BOBBY Woke up and you were gone. Where you been?

SAM Just driving around. No biggie.

(they sit down to drinks and poker)

INT. HOSPITAL

TESSA After you, boss.

( Dean looks into the hospital room to see a father reading to his sick daughter)

FATHER That's you when we went to California. You were 6 then. God. We should burn that. You were adorable.

DEAN The dad or the kid?

TESSA Kid.

DEAN Come on. What is she, 13?

TESSA She's 12.

HILARY And that's...?

FATHER That's your mom...When she was your age.

DEAN This guy have any other family?

TESSA No, not really.

DEAN Well, this is awesome.

TESSA What, you thought it was all gonna be armed robbers and heart attacks waiting to happen?

DEAN She's 12!

TESSA With a serious heart condition.

DEAN Who's next on the list?

TESSA Dean, you have to take her.

DEAN Says who?

TESSA Death.

DEAN I'm death.

TESSA You know what I mean.

DEAN Well, who tells him?

TESSA I don't know. It just is. It's destiny.

DEAN Give me a break. I've spent my whole life fighting that crap. There's no such thing as destiny, just like there was no apocalypse -- just a bunch of stuck-up mooks who didn't want us human slaves asking questions. Well, I say the little girl lives.

TESSA Do you know what's amazing? You don't actually buy a word you're saying.

DEAN Yes, I do.

TESSA Oh, really? So, all the times that you messed with life and death, they just worked out for you? It was just a beach party every time, huh?

DEAN Well, I know this much -- I'm Death, she's 12, and she's not dying today.

(brief cut to Sam & Bobby, playing a very tense game of poker, cut back to hospital)

DR. OWENS Medically, I can't explain it.

FATHER So her heart just healed?

DR. OWENS Couple of times in your career, you see something you just got to call a miracle. All I know is I won't have to operate.

FATHER Thank you. Thank you, doctor. (to Hilary) You did it. You're gonna be okay.

NURSE Hey, hon, guess what? I'm leaving. No, surgery was canceled.

TESSA Come on. We have more work here.

NURSE Okay. See you soon.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE

SAM Pair of aces.

BOBBY (holding out an empty beer bottle)Want another one?

SAM Yeah, sure.

(while Bobby looks in the refrigerator, Sam grabs a wrench and goes to knock out Bobby, but Bobby grabs a bat from the fridge and knocks Sam out first)

BOBBY May have been born at night, boy, but it wasn't last night. (Bobby goes to get rope, but when he turns back Sam is gone) Not good. Let's not do anything hasty here, Sam.


ACT 3

(Bobby hides in his closet, and Sam begins to chop through the closet door with an axe)

BOBBY Don't say, "here's Johnny."

SAM I got to do this, Bobby. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have cornered yourself.

BOBBY I didn't!(Bobby pushes a button and a trap door opens directly under Sam)

(Sam, now in the basement takes a crowbar to the door)

BOBBY Reinforced steel core, titanium kick plate. Get comfy. You want to explain what this is about?

SAM I just, uh...I have to do this, Bobby.

BOBBY Says who?

SAM If Dean shoves that soul back in me, think how bad that could really be. I can't let it happen, Bobby. I mean, it's not like I want to kill you. You've been nothing but good to me.

BOBBY So...What, demon deal or something?

SAM Spell.

BOBBY You're making a mistake, Sam.

SAM I'm trying to survive.

BOBBY Dean's got a way to make it safe.

SAM Oh, yeah, what, some wall inside my head that maybe stays up? Come on.

BOBBY If it works --

SAM Yeah, what if it doesn't? Dean doesn't care about me. He -- he just cares about his little brother, Sammy, burning in hell. He'll kill me to get that other guy back.

BOBBY Look, I...I know how scary it is. But you know what's scarier? You right now. You're not in your right head, Sam. You're not giving us much choice here. Sam? Balls!

(Bobby opens the door and heads downstairs)

BOBBY Ain't nobody killing me in my house but me. I don't want to blow your legs out, boy, but I will.

(Bobby sees Sam has escaped through the vent in the panic room ceiling)

INT. HOSPITAL

DEAN Oh, what, you gonna give me the silent treatment now? Really?

TESSA Damn it! I knew it!

DEAN What?

EMT (wheeling in a gurney)Code 500, E.R. code 500, E.R.

ORDERLY What's going on?

EMT Fractured spine, internal bleeding. Had a heart attack in the ambulance.

ORDERLY We need Dr. Owens.

ORDERLY 2 He just left.

ORDERLY Call Owens. Tell him to turn around.

DEAN Wait, that's...

TESSA You let the girl live. The nurse goes home early, gets in a crash she wouldn't have. And she needs the heart surgeon, and where is he?

DEAN You knew this would happen?

TESSA No. Just knew that you knocked over a domino.

DOCTOR 1 She's in cardiac arrest.

TESSA Take her.

DEAN What?

DOCTOR 2 Clear!

DEAN She's not on the list!

TESSA Everything you do has consequences. Do you want to set off another chain reaction?

DEAN She's got nothing to do with this!

TESSA Well, too bad, Dean. You put on the ring. Now do your damn job.

DOCTOR 2 Clear!

DEAN Fine. (Dean touches Jolene)

DOCTOR 2 She's crashing again. We're losing her. Clear!

JOLENE'S SPIRIT Is that...Am I...

TESSA Yes. I'm sorry.

JOLENE'S SPIRIT But I'm...

TESSA So young.

JOLENE'S SPIRIT Yeah.

TESSA Actually, you were supposed to live for many decades. Have kids, grandkids.

JOLENE'S SPIRIT Then why?

TESSA Because he screwed up.

JOLENE'S SPIRIT (to Dean)You did this to me?

TESSA Come on, Jolene. It's time.

DEAN Wait. I'm sorry.

JOLENE'S HUSBAND Where is she? Where's my wife? Where is she? No! No!

INT. HILARY'S HOSPITAL ROOM

HILARY A real vacation?

FATHER Yeah. I can take you to this one café, show you where I met your mom.

TESSA You saw what happened to the nurse. Go and kill that girl, Dean. I tried to tell you what you already know. She's disrupting the natural order by being alive. You of all people know what that means. Chaos and sadness will follow her for the rest of her life. We tried it your way.

DEAN (watching Jolene's husband through the window)Give me a minute.

TESSA What?

EXT. BOBBY'S YARD

(Bobby follows a trail of Sam's blood to his shed, where Sam knocks him unconscious and drags him inside)

INT. JOLENE'S HUSBAND'S CAR

DEAN Come on, man, pull the car over. You're gonna get yourself killed. What are you doing? Pull the damn car over! Stop the car. Come on, stop the car.

RADIO Route 10 is still shut down...

DEAN What are you doing?! Stop the car!

RADIO From an earlier fatal crash.All traffic has to exit...

DEAN Son of a bitch!(pulls off the ring and yanks the steering wheel to the side)

JOLENE'S HUSBAND Aah!

DEAN Hit the brakes!

JOLENE'S HUSBAND Aah!

(the car crashes, Jolene's husband is slumped forward against the steering wheel)

DEAN Damn it. Tessa!


ACT 4

DEAN You there?! Tessa?! I lost! Sam's screwed! You happy?! Least you can do is zap my ass back home! Hello?! I lost the bet.

TESSA Sorry about your brother.

DEAN Let's just go.

TESSA Go where, Dean? We're done. What are we --

INT. HILARY'S ROOM

DEAN Unfinished business.

TESSA It's over. You took the ring off. Anyway, thought you wanted the girl to skate by.

DEAN No one really skates by. Do they?(to Hilary's father)You should say your goodbyes, man.

FATHER Hey, honey. I must have dozed off. Hilary? Somebody!

HILARY'S SPIRIT I'm dead?

DEAN I'm sorry.

HILARY'S SPIRIT But what about my dad?

DEAN He'll be fine.

HILARY'S SPIRIT Really?

DEAN I have no idea.

HILARY'S SPIRIT I-I can't just leave him. It's not fair!

DEAN I know.

HILARY'S SPIRIT Well, then why?

DEAN Because...There's sort of a --a natural order to things.

HILARY'S SPIRIT Natural order is stupid.

DEAN Well, I agree with you there.

INT. BOBBY'S SHED

BOBBY Listen to me. You don't want to do this. Sam. I've been like a father to you, boy. Somewhere inside, you've got to know that.

(Sam walks over to Bobby holding a knife)

SAM Well, that's just it. Sorry.

(Sam raises the knife up to stab Bobby but Dean intercepts him)

DEAN Hi, Sam. I'm back. (Dean knocks out Sam)


FINAL ACT

INT. BOBBY'S BASEMENT

(Dean looks at Sam who is cuffed to the panic room cot)

DEAN I can't keep doing this, Bobby. I mean, what am I, gonna tie him up every time he tries to kill someone? And that's not gonna hold him. I mean, he's -

BOBBY --capable of anything.

DEAN What am I supposed to do here?

BOBBY I don't know.

(Dean heads to Bobby's kitchen)

DEATH Dean. Join me.Brought you one --(Death hands Dean a hot dog) from a little stand in Los Angeles known for their bacon dogs. Sit.

DEAN Boy, what's with you and cheap food?

DEATH I could ask you the same thing. Thought I'd have a treat before I put the ring back on. Heavier than it looks, isn't it? Sometimes, you just want the thing off. But you know that. Not hungry?

DEAN Look... I think you know that I flunked. So there. Oh, and by the way, I, uh...I sucked at being you. Really screwed up the whole natural order thing. But I'm sure you knew about that, too.

DEATH So, if you could go back, would you simply kill the little girl? No fuss, no stomping your feet?

DEAN Knowing what I know now, yeah.

DEATH I'm surprised to hear that. Surprised and glad.

DEAN Yeah, well, don't get excited. I would have saved the nurse, okay? That's it.

DEATH I think it's a little more than that. Today, you got a hard look behind the curtain. Wrecking the natural order's not quite such fun when you have to mop up the mess, is it? This is hard for you, Dean. You throw away your life because you've come to assume that it'll bounce right back into your lap. But the human soul is not a rubber ball. It's vulnerable, impermanent, but stronger than you know. And more valuable than you can imagine. So... I think you've learned something today.

DEAN Want to know what I think? I think you knew that I wouldn't last a day.

DEATH I have no idea what you're talking about.

DEAN I lost. Fine. But at least have the balls to admit that it was rigged from the jump.

DEATH Most people speak to me with more respect.

DEAN I didn't mean --

DEATH We're done here. It's been lovely. But now I'm going to go to hell to get your brother's soul.

DEAN Why would you do that for me?

DEATH I wouldn't do it for you. You and your brother keep coming back. You're an affront to the balance of the universe, and you cause disruption on a global scale.

DEAN I apologize for that.

DEATH But you have use. Right now, you're digging at something. The intrepid Detective. I want you to keep digging, Dean.

DEAN So you're just gonna be cryptic, or...

DEATH It's about the souls. You'll understand when you need to.

DEAN Wait --with Sam... Is this wall thing really gonna work?

DEATH Call it 75%.

DEAN Bobby!

INT. BOBBY'S BASEMENT

DEAN Open the door.

BOBBY What happened?

DEAN Now!

INT. PANIC ROOM

SAM Get away from me! Don't. Don't!

DEATH Now, Sam, I'm gonna put up a barrier inside your mind.

SAM No, don't touch me.

DEATH It might feel a little...Itchy. Do me a favor --don't scratch the wall. trust me -- you're not gonna like what happens.

SAM Please. Don't do this.

(Death takes Sam's soul out of his bag and goes to put it back inside Sam)

SAM No, no! You don't know! You don't know what'll happen to me! Dean, please! No. No. No.

(Death puts Sam's soul back in him)

SAM Aah!
