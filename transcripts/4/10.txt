TEASER

INT. CABIN - NIGHT
The scene continues from the last episode.

SAM
You want Anna? Why?

URIEL
Out of the way.
DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, I know she's wiretapping your angel chats or whatever, but it's no reason to gank her.

URIEL
Don't worry. I'll kill her gentle.

DEAN
You're some heartless sons of bitches, you know that?

CASTIEL
As a matter of fact, we are. And?

SAM
And? Anna's an innocent girl.

CASTIEL
She is far from innocent.

SAM
What's that supposed to mean?

URIEL
It means she's worse than this abomination you've been screwing. Now give us the girl.

DEAN
Sorry. Get yourself another one. Try JDate.

URIEL
Who's gonna stop us? You two? Or this demon whore?

URIEL throws RUBY against a wall. DEAN attacks him.

SAM
Cas, stop...please.

CASTIEL touches SAM's forehead and he falls to the ground. URIEL punches DEAN.

URIEL
I've been waiting for this.

Suddenly a bright light engulfs CASTIEL and URIEL and they disappear.

DEAN
What the...

DEAN helps RUBY to her feet.

DEAN
Come on.

RUBY then kneels by SAM, who is stirring. DEAN gets into a back room and finds ANNA with her hands and arms covered in her own blood.

DEAN
Anna. Anna!

ANNA has used her blood to draw sigils on a mirror.

ANNA
Are they -- are they gone?

DEAN
Did you kill them?

ANNA
No. I sent them away... far away.

DEAN
You want to tell me how?

ANNA
That just popped in my head. I don't know how I did it. I just did it.


ACT ONE

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

DEAN
So, what do you think?

SAM
I think Anna's getting more interesting by the second.

DEAN
Yeah, I agree. And what did they mean by "she's not innocent"?

SAM
It seems like they want her bad, and not just 'cause of the angel radio thing. I mean, that blood spell -- Some serious crap, man.

DEAN
Something's going on with her. See what you can find out.
SAM
What are you gonna do?

DEAN
Anna may have sent the angels to the outfield, but, sooner or later, they're gonna be back. We got to get ourselves safe now.

INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM - DAY

ANNA is sitting in a chair in the panic room.

DEAN
Iron walls drenched in salt. Demons can't even touch the joint.

RUBY is waiting outside the open door.

RUBY
Which I find racist, by the way.

DEAN
Write your congressman.

RUBY
Here.

DEAN
Hex bags?

RUBY
Extra-crunchy. They'll hide us from angels, demons, all comers.

DEAN
Thanks, Ruby. [ to ANNA ] Don't lose this. So, Anna, what's playing on angel radio? Anything useful?

ANNA
It's quiet. Dead silence.

DEAN
Good. That's not troubling at all.

ANNA
We're in trouble, huh? You guys are scared?

DEAN
Nah.

SAM [ Out of sight ]
Hey, Dean!

DEAN
Just stay here, okay? [ to RUBY ] Keep an eye on her.

INT. BOBBY'S DINING ROOM - DAY

DEAN
How's the car?

SAM
I got her. She's fine. Where's Bobby?

DEAN
Uh, The Dominican. He said we break anything, we buy it.

SAM
He's working a job?
DEAN
God, I hope so. Otherwise, he's at hedonism in a banana hammock and a trucker cap.

SAM
Now that's seared in my brain.

DEAN
All right, what did you find on Anna?

SAM
Uh, not much. Her parents were, uh, Rich and Amy Milton -- a church deacon and a housewife.

DEAN
Riveting.
SAM
Yeah. But there is something here in the report. Turns out this latest psych episode wasn't her first.
DEAN
No?

SAM
When she was 2 1/2, she'd get hysterical any time her dad got close. She was convinced that he wasn't her real daddy.

DEAN
Who was? The plumber, hmm? A little snaking the pipes?

SAM
Dude, you're confusing reality with porn again. Look, Anna didn't say. She just kept repeating that this real father of hers was mad. Very mad -- like wanted-to-kill-her mad.

DEAN
Kind of heavy for a 2-year-old.

SAM
Well, she saw a kid's shrink, got better, and grew up normal.

DEAN
Until now. So, what's she hiding?

ANNA
Why don't you just ask me to my face?

DEAN
Nice job watching her.

RUBY
I'm watching her.

SAM
No, you're right, Anna. Is there anything you want to tell us?

ANNA
About what?

SAM
The angels said you were guilty of something. Why would they say that?

ANNA
You tell me. Tell me why my life has been leveled... Why my parents are dead. I don't know. I swear. I would give anything to know.

SAM
Okay. Then let's find out.

ANNA
How?

INT. BOBBY'S BASEMENT - DAY
DEAN is leading PAMELA down the stairs.

DEAN
We're here!

SAM
Pamela, hey!

PAMELA
Sam?
SAM
It's me. it's Sam
PAMELA
SAM?
SAM
Yeah.

PAMELA
Sam, is that you?
SAM
I'm right here.

PAMELA
Oh. Know how I can tell? [ grabs SAM's ass ] That perky little ass of yours. You could bounce a nickel off that thing. Of course I know it's you, grumpy. Same way I know that's a demon, and that poor girl's Anna and that you've been eyeing my rack.

SAM
Uh... uh... uh...

PAMELA
Don't sweat it, kiddo. I still got more senses than most.

SAM
Got it.

PAMELA
Hey, Anna. How are you? I'm Pamela.

ANNA
Hi.

PAMELA
Dean told me what's been going on. I'm excited to help.

ANNA
Oh. That's nice of you.

PAMELA
Oh, well, not really. Any chance I can dick over an angel, I'm taking it.

ANNA
Why?

PAMELA
They stole something from me. [ takes off her sunglasses, revealing white eyes ] Demon-y, I know. But they're just plastic. Good for business. Makes me look extra-psychic, don't you think? [ laughs ] Now...how about you tell me what your deal is? Hmm? Don't you worry.

INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM - DAY

PAMELA
Nice and relaxed. Now, I'm going to count down from five to zero. When we're at zero, you'll be in a deep state of hypnosis. As I count down, just go deeper and deeper, okay? 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. Deep sleep. Deep sleep. Every muscle calm and relaxed. Can you hear me?

ANNA
I can hear you.

PAMELA
Now, Anna, tell me... How can you hear the angels? How did you work that spell?

ANNA
I don't know. I just did.

PAMELA
Your father... What's his name?

ANNA
Rich Milton.

PAMELA
All right. But I want you to look further back... When you were very young... Just a couple of years old.

ANNA
I don't want to.

PAMELA
It'll be okay. Anna, just one look -- that's all we need.

ANNA
No.

PAMELA
What's your dad's name? Your real dad. Why is he angry at you?

ANNA
No. No! No. [ screams ] No!

PAMELA
Calm down.
ANNA
[screams ] He's gonna kill me!

PAMELA
Anna, you're safe.

ANNA
[ screams ] No! [ the lights explode and glass shatters ]

PAMELA
Calm down.

ANNA
[screams ] He's gonna kill me!

PAMELA
It's all right, Anna.

DEAN
Anna?

DEAN walks towards ANNA.

PAMELA
Dean, don't.

ANNA throws DEAN across the room.

PAMELA
Wake in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Anna... Anna? You all right?

ANNA
Thank you, Pamela. That helps a lot. I remember now.

SAM
Remember what?

ANNA
Who I am.

DEAN
I'll bite. Who are you?

ANNA
I'm an angel.


ACT TWO

INT. BOBBY'S LIBRARY - DAY

ANNA
Don't be afraid, I'm not like the others.

RUBY
I don't find that very reassuring.

PAMELA
Neither do I.

ANNA
So...Castiel, Uriel -- they're the ones that came for me?
SAM
You know them?

ANNA
We were kind of in the same foxhole.

DEAN
So, what, were they like your bosses or something?

ANNA
Try the other way around.

DEAN
Look at you.

PAMELA
But now they want to kill you?

ANNA
Orders are orders. I'm sure I have a death sentence on my head.

PAMELA
Why?

ANNA
I disobeyed... which, for us, is about the worst thing you can do. I fell.

DEAN
Meaning?

PAMELA
She fell to earth, became human.

SAM
Wait a minute. I don't understand. So, angels can just become human?

ANNA
It kind of hurts. Try cutting your kidney out with a butter knife. That kind of hurt. I ripped out my grace.

DEAN
Come again?

ANNA
My grace. It's... energy. Hacked it out and fell. My mother, Amy, couldn't get pregnant. Always called me her little miracle. She had no idea how right she was.

DEAN
So, you just forgot that you were God's little Power Ranger?

ANNA
The older I got, the longer I was human, yeah.

RUBY
I don't think you all appreciate how completely screwed we are.

ANNA
Ruby's right. Heaven wants me dead.

RUBY
And Hell just wants her. A flesh-and-blood angel that you can question, torture, that bleeds. Sister, you're the Stanley Cup. And sooner or later, Heaven or Hell, they're gonna find you.

ANNA
I know. And that's why I'm gonna get it back.

SAM
What?

ANNA
My grace.

DEAN
You can do that?
ANNA
If I can find it.

DEAN
So, what, you're just gonna take some divine bong hit, and, shazam, you're Roma Downey?

ANNA
Something like that.

DEAN
All right. I like this plan. So, where's this grace of yours?

ANNA
Lost track. I was falling about 10,000 miles per hour at the time.

SAM
Wait. You mean falling, like, literally?

ANNA
Yes.

SAM
Like the way a human eye can see? Like a comet, maybe, or a meteor?

ANNA
Why do you ask?

INT. BOBBY'S LIBRARY - NIGHT
SAM is surrounded by books and old magazines.

SAM
Here. In march '85, a meteorite vanished in the night sky over northwestern Ohio. It was sighted nine months before Anna was born, and she was born in that part of Ohio.

RUBY
You're pretty buff for a nerd.

SAM
Look, I think it was Anna and here, same time -- another meteor over Kentucky.

RUBY
And that's her grace?

SAM
Might be.

RUBY
All right. That just narrows it down to an entire state.

SAM
Look, it's a start.

RUBY
Sam... I'm sorry.

SAM
For what?

RUBY
For bringing you this mess. If I had known, I would have kept my trap shut.

SAM
Yeah, well, we'll muddle through.

RUBY
Not this time. You do not want to get between these two armies. It's Godzilla and Mothra. If one side doesn't get us, the other one will.

SAM
So, what do you want to do? Dump Anna and run? Forget it. Look, I know the angels freak you out.

RUBY
Forget the angels. It's Alastair I'm scared of.

SAM
Alastair?
RUBY
You met him in the church. Practically the grand inquisitor downstairs. Picasso with a razor.

SAM
And?

RUBY
And you should pull him out and throw him back in the pit... if you weren't so out of shape.

SAM
Ruby...

RUBY
No, your abilities -- you're getting flabby.

SAM
Yeah, so how do I tone up?

RUBY
You know how. You know what you got to do.

SAM
No, I'm not doing that anymore.

RUBY
Sam...
SAM
I said no.

RUBY
Well, then you better pray that Anna gets her groove back, or we're all dead.

EXT. BOBBY'S SALVAGE YARD - NIGHT

ANNA
Pamela get home okay?

DEAN
Yeah. She said she was sorry. It's just after last time, she, uh... This is just a little too rich for her blood.

ANNA
I don't blame her. You guys should do the same.

DEAN
Well, we're not that smart. Can I ask you something? What do they want me for? Why did they save me?

ANNA
I'm sorry. The angels aren't talking about it. And it was after I fell.

DEAN
That's another question. Why would you fall? Why would you want to be one of us?

ANNA
You don't mean that.

DEAN
I don't? A bunch of -- of miserable bastards... Eating, crapping, confused, afraid.

ANNA
I don't know. There's loyalty... forgiveness... love.

DEAN
Pain.
ANNA
Chocolate cake.

DEAN
Guilt.
ANNA
Sex.

DEAN
Yeah, you got me there.

ANNA
I mean it. Every emotion, Dean, even the bad ones... It's why I fell. It's why... why I'd give anything not to have to go back. Anything.

DEAN
Feelings are overrated, if you ask me.

ANNA
Beats being an angel.

DEAN
How's that possible? You guys are powerful and perfect. You don't doubt yourselves or God or anything.

ANNA
Perfect... Like a marble statue. Cold... no choice... only obedience. Dean, do you know how many angels have actually seen God? Seen his face?

DEAN
All of you?

ANNA
Four angels. Four. And I'm not one of them.

DEAN
That's it? Well, then how do you even know that there is a God?

ANNA
We have to take it on faith... Which we're killed if we don't have.

DEAN
Huh.

ANNA
I was stationed on earth 2,000 years. Just... watching... silent... invisible... out on the road... sick for home... waiting on orders from an unknowable father I can't begin to understand. So don't tell me that --

DEAN laughs.

ANNA
What is so funny? What?

DEAN
Nothing. Sorry. It's just...I can relate.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN
Did you find something?

SAM
I think so.

INT. BOBBY'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

SAM
Union, Kentucky. Found some accounts of a local miracle.

DEAN
Yeah?
SAM
Yeah. In '85, there was an empty field outside of town. Six months later, there was a full-grown oak. They say it looks a century old at least.

DEAN
Anna, what do you think?

ANNA
The grace. Where it hit, it could have done something like that, easy.

DEAN
So grace ground zero -- it's not destruction. It's...

ANNA
Pure creation.

INT. IMPALA - NIGHT
DEAN is driving. SAM is beside him and ANNA and RUBY are at the backseat. DEAN looks in the rear-view mirror and laughs.

RUBY
What?

DEAN
Nothing. It's just an angel and a demon riding in the backseat. It's like the setup to a bad joke... or a Penthouse Forum letter.

SAM
Dude... Reality... Porn.

DEAN
You call this reality?

EXT. OAK FIELD - DAY

DEAN
It's beautiful.

ANNA
It's where the grace touched down. I can feel it.

DEAN
You ready to do this?

ANNA
Not really.

SAM
Anna, what are we even looking for?

ANNA puts a hand on the tree trunk.

ANNA
It doesn't matter. It's not here. Not anymore. Someone took it.


ACT THREE

INT. BARN - NIGHT

DEAN
We still got the hex bags. I say we head back to the panic room.

RUBY
What, forever?

DEAN
I'm just thinking out loud!

RUBY
Oh, you call that thinking?

SAM
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Stop it.

RUBY
Anna's grace is gone. You understand? She can't angel up. She can't protect us. We can't fight Heaven and Hell. One side maybe, but not both. Not at once.

ANNA
Um... guys? The angels are talking again.

SAM
What are they saying?

ANNA
It's weird... Like a recording... a loop. It says, "Dean Winchester gives us Anna by midnight, or..."

DEAN
Or what?

ANNA
"...or we hurl him back to damnation."

SAM
Anna.. Do you know of any weapon that works on an angel? To what? To kill them?

SAM nods.

ANNA
Nothing we could get to... Not right now.

DEAN
Okay, wait, wait. I say we call Bobby. We get him back from hedonism.

SAM
Dean, what's he gonna tell us that we don't already know?

DEAN
I don't know, but we got to think of something!

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
DEAN is studying a book over the IMPALA.

DEAN
Hey. Holding up okay?

ANNA
Trying.

DEAN
Yeah.

ANNA
A little scared, I guess. So, um... Dean... I just wanted to thank you.

DEAN
For what?

ANNA
Everything. You guys -- you didn't have to help me --

DEAN
Hey, let's can the "thanks for trying" speech, you know? Participation trophies suck ass.

ANA
I don't know. Maybe I don't deserve to be saved.

DEAN
Don't talk like that.

ANNA
I disobeyed. Lucifer disobeyed. It's our murder one, and I knew it. Maybe I got to pay.

DEAN
Yeah, well, we've all done things we got to pay for.

ANNA
I got to tell you something. You're not gonna like it.

DEAN
Okay. what?

ANNA
About a week ago, I heard the angels talking... About you... What you did in Hell. Dean, I know. It wasn't your fault. You should forgive yourself.

DEAN
Anna, I don't w-want to, uh... I don't want to... I can't talk about that.

ANNA
I know. But when you can, you have people that want to help. You are not alone. That's all I'm trying to say.

ANNA kisses DEAN.

DEAN
What was that for?

ANNA
You know... Our last night on earth... All that.

DEAN
You're stealing my best line.

INT. IMPALA - NIGHT
Ready for love by Bad Company is playing while DEAN and ANNA make love.

INT. BARN - NIGHT
SAM is asleep over an open book as RUBY leaves.

EXT. CROSSROAD - NIGHT
RUBY burns her hex bag.

ALASTAIR
Hello, Ruby.

RUBY
Alastair.

ALASTAIR
I have to say, I'm surprised to find you out in the open like this.

RUBY
Yeah? Desperate times.

ALASTAIR
That they are. You looking for this? [ takes out Ruby's knife ] Your gawky human friend gave it to me.

RUBY
Keep it. I just came to talk.

ALASTAIR
About what? About how a demon is protecting an angel? We really must revoke your membership.

RUBY
Look, I know I'm not employee of the month, but this -- I never wanted to get in the middle of this.

ALASTAIR
Why are you here, Ruby?

RUBY
I'll give you the angel.

ALASTAIR
Will you? And in return?

RUBY
I walk away. Me and the Winchester boys, both of them. This angel business is none of our business.

ALASTAIR
Hmm. You know...I'd always heard that you were a devious, cowardly little slut. You don't disappoint.

RUBY
So, what do you say?

ALASTAIR
It's interesting... Prudent.

Two demons appear and grab RUBY from behind.

ALASTAIR
But, uh... Let me make you a... counteroffer.

INT. BARN - NIGHT

URIEL
Look at that. It's so cute when monkeys wear clothes.

DEAN
I'm dreaming, aren't I?

URIEL
It's the only way we could chat... since you're hiding like cowards.

DEAN
Don't normally see you off leash. Where's your boss?

URIEL
Castiel? Oh, he, uh... He's not here. See, he has this weakness. He likes you. Time's up, boy. We want the girl.

DEAN
Wouldn't try that if I were you. See, she got her grace back. Full-blown angel now.

URIEL
That would be a neat trick, considering... [ takes out a necklace ] ...I have her grace right here. We can't let Hell get their hooks into her.

DEAN
Well, then why don't you just give her back her angel juice?

URIEL
She committed a serious crime.

DEAN
What? Thinking for herself?

URIEL
This is our business, not yours. She's not even human... Not technically.

DEAN
Yeah, well, I guess I just like being a pain in the pooper.

URIEL
No. There's more. You cut yourself a slice of... angel food cake. Didn't you? Huh? You did.

DEAN
What do you care? You're junkless down there, right? Like a Ken doll?

URIEL
Ooh. Well, it's your last chance. Give us the girl, or --
DEAN
Or what? What, you're gonna toss me back in the hole? You're bluffing.

URIEL
Try me. This is a whole lot bigger than the plans we got for you, Dean. You can be replaced.

DEAN
What the hell? Go ahead and do it.

URIEL
You're just crazy enough to go, aren't you?

DEAN
What can I say? I don't break easy.

URIEL
Oh, yes... you do. You just got to know where to apply the right pressure.

INT. OLD BATHROOM - NIGHT
RUBY is tied to some kind of dentist chair, ALASTAIR is torturing her with her knife.

ALASTAIR
You know the problem with your generation? Instant gratification. It's all now, now, now. No patience, no craftsmanship. But I do have to say... This knife of yours... It's an exquisite piece. You must tell me where you found it. You know... I haven't been up here since Poland '43. Truth is, I loathe it. It's chilly. No stink of blood or sizzle of flesh or the wet flap of flayed skin. I don't know how you stand it. So, the sooner you cooperate, the sooner I can finish up with this ghastly angel business and return home to my studies. But no rush. Let's take our time... Relish the moment. Now, I'm going to remove this, but don't you go smoking out of that meat. You won't get very far.

RUBY
Oh!

ALASTAIR
Now you tell me where that angel is.

RUBY
No.
ALASTAIR
No?

RUBY
No. I tell you, you kill me. But I'll show you.

INT. BARN - DAY

SAM
I don't know, man. Where's Ruby?

DEAN
Hey, she's your Hell buddy.

DEAN is drinking from his flask.

ANNA
Little early for that, isn't it?

DEAN
It's 2 a.m. somewhere.

ANNA
You okay?

DEAN
Yeah, of course.

The doors open with a blast and CASTIEL and URIEL enter.

CASTIEL
Hello, Anna. It's good to see you.

SAM
How? How did you find us? [ pause ] Dean?

DEAN
[to ANNA] I'm sorry.

SAM
Why?

ANNA
Because they gave him a choice. They either kill me... or kill you. I know how their minds work.

ANNA kisses DEAN goodbye.

ANNA
You did the best you could. I forgive you. Okay. No more tricks. No more running. I'm ready.


ACT FOUR

INT. BARN - DAY

CASTIEL
I'm sorry.

ANNA
No. You're not. Not really. You don't know the feeling.

CASTIEL
Still, we have a history. It's just --
ANNA
Orders are orders. I know. Just make it quick.

ALASTAIR, a bleeding RUBY and another demon appear.

ALASTAIR
Don't you touch a hair on that poor girl's head.

URIEL
How dare you come in this room... you pussing sore?

ALASTAIR
Name-calling. That hurt my feelings... You sanctimonious, fanatical prick.

CASTIEL
Turn around and walk away now.

ALASTAIR
Sure. Just give us the girl. We'll make sure she gets punished good and proper.

CASTIEL
You know who we are and what we will do. I won't say it again. Leave now... or we lay you to waste.

ALASTAIR
Think I'll take my chances.

Angels and demons begin to fight. CASTIEL tries to exorcise ALASTAIR with his hand with no result.

ALASTAIR
Sorry, kiddo. Why don't you go run to daddy?

URIEL exorcises a demon.

DEMON
Aaaaahhhh!

ALASTAIR begins to exorcise CASTIEL.

ALASTAIR
Potestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferma, me confirma!

DEAN hits ALASTAIR with a crowbar.

ALASTAIR
Dean, Dean, Dean... I am so disappointed. You had such promise.

ALASTAIR attacks DEAN and SAM. ANNA takes her grace from URIEL while he is killing the other demon.

URIEL
No!

ANNA breaks the pendant releasing the grace. White light flows into her mouth.

ANNA
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes! Shut your eyes!

Bright light comes out from ANNA's body and makes ALASTAIR disappear, leaving behind RUBY's knife.

DEAN
Well, what are you guys waiting for? Go get Anna. Unless, of course, you're scared.

URIEL
This isn't over.

DEAN
Oh, it looks over to me, junkless.

CASTIEL and URIEL disappear.

SAM
You okay?

RUBY
Not so much.

DEAN
What took you so long to get here?

RUBY
Sorry I'm late with the demon delivery. I was only being tortured.

DEAN
I got to hand it to you, Sammy. Bringing them all together all at once -- angels and demons. It was a damn good plan.

SAM
Yeah, well, when you got Godzilla and Mothra on your ass, best to get out of their way and let them fight.

DEAN
Yeah, now you're just bragging.

SAM
So, I guess she's some big-time angel now, huh? She must be happy... Wherever she is.

DEAN
I doubt it.


ACT FIVE
EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY

SAM is sitting on the hood of the Impala with a beer, and DEAN is leaning against the side of the car near him.

DEAN
I can't believe we made it out of there.

SAM
Again.

DEAN holds out his bottle and SAM clinks it.

DEAN
I know you heard him.

SAM
Who?

DEAN
Alastair. What he said... about how I had promise.

SAM
I heard him.

DEAN
You're not curious?

SAM
Dean, I'm damn curious. But you're not talking about Hell, and I'm not pushing.

DEAN
It wasn't four months, you know.

SAM
What?

DEAN
It was four months up here, but down there... I don't know. Time's different. It was more like 40 years.

SAM
My God.

DEAN
They, uh... They sliced and carved and tore at me in ways that you... Until there was nothing left. And then, suddenly... I would be whole again... like magic... just so they could start in all over. And Alastair... at the end of every day... every one... he would come over. And he would make me an offer. To take me off the rack... if I put souls on... if I started the torturing. And every day, I told him to stick it where the sun shines. For 30 years, I told him. But then I couldn't do it anymore, Sammy. I couldn't. And I got off that rack. God help me, I got right off it, and I started ripping them apart. I lost count of how many souls. [ a tear rolls down his cheek ] The -- the things that I did to them.

SAM
Dean... Dean, look, you held out for 30 years. That's longer than anyone would have.

DEAN
[ crying ] How I feel... This... inside me... I wish I couldn't feel anything, Sammy. I wish I couldn't feel a damn thing.
