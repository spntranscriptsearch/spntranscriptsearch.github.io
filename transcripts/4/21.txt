TEASER


INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – DAY

SAM is inside the room, DEAN just outside, talking through the little barred window in the door.

SAM
Okay. Let me out. This is not funny.

DEAN
Damn straight.

SAM
Dean, come on. This is crazy.

DEAN
No. Not until you dry out.

SAM
Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied to you. Just open the door.

DEAN
You don't have to apologize. It's not your fault. It's not your fault that you lied to me over and over again. I get it now. You couldn't help it.

SAM
I'm not some junkie.

DEAN
Really? I guess I've just imagined how strung out you've been lately.

SAM
You're actually trying to twist this into some kind of ridiculous drug intervention?

DEAN
If it smells like a duck.

SAM
Dean, I'm not drinking the demon blood for kicks. I'm getting strong enough to kill Lilith.

DEAN
Strong?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
This is about as far away from strong as you can get. Try weak. Try desperate. Pathetic.

SAM
Killing Lilith is what matters. Or are you so busy being self-righteous you forgot about her?

DEAN
Oh, Lilith's gonna die. Bobby and I will kill her. But not with you.

SAM
You're not serious.

DEAN
Congrats, Sammy. You just bought yourself a benchwarmer seat to the apocalypse.

SAM
Dean, look—no, wait—

DEAN shuts the window cover.

SAM
Come back here. Dean! Let me out of here! Dean! Let me out of here! Let me out! Dean!

ACT ONE


INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – DAY

SAM bangs on the door and circles the room; the room blurs. The light flickers.

SAM
Guys! Get down here! Something's coming!

ALASTAIR appears behind SAM, wearing the same body as in 4.16 On the Head of a Pin.

ALASTAIR
Hello, Sam. It's a pleasure to see you again. Looks like I have you all to myself here. Goodness. How will we pass the time?

SAM is bound to a cross inside a devil's trap, gagged.

SAM
Don't. No, no, don't. Don't, don't. No—stop! Stop! Alastair—please. Please.

ALASTAIR
So polite all of a sudden. Very nice. I appreciate that.

SAM
No. Alastair, please. No, no—

SAM screams. He is neither gagged nor bound; he is on the cot in the middle of the devil's trap, arms over the open air on either side.

SAM
No. No. God, no! Please! Please, please. God!

INT. BOBBY'S LIVING ROOM – DAY

BOBBY pours two glasses of whiskey and hands one to DEAN.

SAM
Stop! Stop!

DEAN
How long is this gonna go on?

BOBBY
Here, let me look it up in my demon-detox manual. Oh wait. No one ever wrote one. No telling how long it'll take. Hell, or if Sam will even live through it.

The phone rings. BOBBY sighs and answers.

BOBBY
Hello. ...Suck dirt and die, Rufus. You call me again, I'll kill you.

DEAN
What's up with Rufus?

BOBBY
He knows.

The phone rings. BOBBY answers.

BOBBY
I'm busy, you son of a bitch. This better be important.

INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – DAY

SAM realizes he's neither gagged nor bound; it surprises him.

BOY
The answer's yes. You're hallucinating.

SAM looks at him; it's YOUNG SAM from 3.08 A Very Supernatural Christmas and 4.13 After School Special.

YOUNG SAM
That's right, it's me. Or I mean it's you.

SAM
I'm losing my mind.

YOUNG SAM
Definitely.

SAM
What do you want?

YOUNG SAM
An explanation. How could you do this to me? I thought we were gonna be normal.

SAM
I tried. I did. It didn't pan out that way. Sorry, kid.

YOUNG SAM
'Sorry, kid'? That's what you have to say? It's all we ever wanted. We were so close. You got away from Dad. You quit hunting. You were gonna become a lawyer and get married. Why'd you blow it?

SAM
Look. They killed Jessica.

YOUNG SAM
Yeah. And if you hadn't run off with Dean, if you'd been there to protect her, she'd still be alive.

SAM
I know.

YOUNG SAM
You think Jess would want you to turn into this? She loved you. You think she'd be happy you using her as an excuse?

SAM
I'm sorry. I am. But life doesn't turn out the way you thought when you were fourteen years old. We were never gonna be normal. We were never gonna get away. Grow up.

YOUNG SAM
Maybe you're right. Maybe there's no escape. After all, how can you run from what's inside you?

YOUNG SAM's eyes turn yellow.

INT. BOBBY'S LIVING ROOM – DAY

BOBBY
The news. The news ain't good.

DEAN
This is what Rufus called about? 'Key West sees ten species go extinct'.

BOBBY
Yep. Plus Alaska. Fifteen-man fishing crew all stricken blind, cause unknown. New York, teacher goes postal, locks the door, kills exactly sixty-six kids. All this in a single day. I looked them up. There's no doubt about it. They're all seals. Breaking. Fast.

DEAN
How many are left?

BOBBY
Who knows? Can't be many. Where the hell are your angel pals?

DEAN
You tell me.

BOBBY
I'm just wondering.

DEAN
What?

BOBBY
The apocalypse being nigh and all...is now really the right time to be having this little domestic drama of ours?

DEAN
What do you mean?

BOBBY
Well, I don't like this any more than you do, but Sam can kill demons. He's got a shot at stopping Armageddon.

DEAN
So what? Sacrifice Sam's life, his soul, for the greater good? Is that what you're saying? Times are bad, so let's use Sam as a nuclear warhead?

BOBBY
Look, I know you hate me for suggesting it. I hate me for suggesting it. I love that boy like a son. All I'm saying is maybe he's here right now instead of on the battlefield because we love him too much.

INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – DAY

SAM sits crosslegged on the floor of the room and looks around. The room blurs in and out of focus. SAM spots the pitcher of water and tries to get it; he has to brace himself on the cot to get off the floor.

WOMAN
Poor baby.

SAM looks up, startled.

SAM
Mom.

MARY is wearing a white nightgown with a large bloodstain.

MARY
Sam. You look just awful.

SAM laughs.

SAM
Let's hear it. Go ahead.

MARY
What do you mean?

SAM
You're disappointed. You never thought I'd turn out this way. I'm a piss-poor excuse for a son. Your heart is broken. Am I close?

MARY
Not at all. You're doing the right thing, Sam. What you're doing is brave. You're not being crazy, you're being practical. Sam, I am so proud of you.

SAM
But—but Dean—

MARY
Your brother doesn't understand. I was raised a hunter from a long line. We understand that there are gonna be hard choices. And we do what we have to to get the job done. Yes, our family is cursed. But you—you have the power to turn it into a gift. You can use it against them.

SAM
For revenge?

MARY
No, for justice. I know how scared you are.

SAM
What's in me, Mom, it's—

MARY
Evil. And you know it.

SAM
What if it's stronger than me? Look at me. What if Dean's right?

MARY
Dean can never know how strong you are, because Dean is weak. Look at what he's done to you. Locking you in here? He's terrified. He's in over his head. You have to go on without him. You have what it takes. You have to kill Lilith.

SAM
Even if it kills me.

MARY
Make my death mean something. I'm counting on you, Sam. Don't let anyone or anything get in your way. Not even Dean.

MARY kisses SAM and vanishes.

EXT. BOBBY'S SALVAGE YARD – NIGHT

DEAN
Well, it's about time. I've been screaming myself hoarse out here for about two and a half hours now.

CASTIEL
What do you want?

DEAN
You can start with what the hell happened in Illinois.

CASTIEL
What do you mean?

DEAN
Cut the crap. You were gonna tell me something.

CASTIEL
Well, nothing of import.

DEAN
You got ass-reamed in heaven but it was not of import?

CASTIEL
Dean, I can't. I'm sorry. Get to the reason you really called me. It's about Sam, right?

DEAN
Can he do it? Kill Lilith, stop the apocalypse?

CASTIEL
Possibly, yes. But as you know, he'd have to take certain steps.

DEAN
Crank up the hell-blood regimen.

CASTIEL
Consuming the amount of blood it would take to kill Lilith would change your brother forever. Most likely, he would become the next creature that you would feel compelled to kill. There's no reason this would have to come to pass, Dean. We believe it's you, Dean, not your brother. The only question for us is whether you're willing to accept it. Stand up and accept your role. You are the one who will stop it.

DEAN
If I do this, Sammy doesn't have to?

CASTIEL
If it gives you comfort to see it that way.

DEAN
God, you're a dick these days.

DEAN walks a few steps away and sighs.

DEAN
Fine, I'm in.

CASTIEL
You give yourself over wholly to the service of God and his angels?

DEAN
Yeah, exactly.

CASTIEL
Say it.

DEAN
I give myself over wholly to serve God and you guys.

CASTIEL
You swear to follow his will and his word as swiftly and obediently as you did your own father's?

DEAN
Yes, I swear. Now what?

CASTIEL
Now you wait, and we call on you when it's time.

ACT TWO


INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – DAY

SAM sits on the floor, twitching. Black veins spread across his palms and up his arms. He gets up and looks in the mirror; black veins spread across his face.

SAM
Guys! Help!

INT. BOBBY'S LIVING ROOM – DAY

SAM
Bobby! Dean! Help! Hey! Hey! Guys! Guys! Help! Dean!

BOBBY
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you willingly signed up to be the angels' bitch?

DEAN looks at him.

BOBBY
I'm sorry. You prefer 'sucker'? After everything you said about them, now you trust them?

DEAN
Come on, give me a little credit, Bobby. I've never trusted them less. I mean, they come on like shady politicians from planet Vulcan.

BOBBY
Then why in the hell did you—

DEAN
Because what other option do I have? It's either trust the angels or let Sammy trust a demon?

BOBBY
I see your point.

DEAN
You hear that?

BOBBY
Yeah, that's a little too much nothing.

DEAN and BOBBY hurry to the basement and open the window in the door. SAM is on the floor of the panic room, having a seizure.

DEAN
What if he's faking?

BOBBY
You really think he would?

DEAN
I think he'd do anything.

SAM is slammed against the wall by an invisible force.

BOBBY
That ain't faking.

They throw open the door and charge in to get SAM down and pin him to the cot.

BOBBY
We're gonna have to tie him down for his own safety. Dean? You with me? Dean! Before he has another fit.

DEAN
Yeah, yeah. Let's just get it over with.

INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – DAY

SAM, calm now, discovers he's been chained to the cot. He sits up.

DEAN
We had to. The demon blood was flinging you all over the room. Tell me something, Sam. Why did you do this to yourself?

SAM
You know why.

DEAN
Right. 'Kill Lilith'. The big excuse. But why? What, revenge? Right?

SAM
Of course.

DEAN
Revenge for what? For sending me to hell? Did you happen to notice I'm back? Alive and kicking. So what's the point?

SAM
Point? How about 'stop the damn apocalypse'?

SAM is addressing an empty room.

DEAN
My gig. Not yours. The angels said so, remember? God picked me, man. So you got any other fantastic excuses? Hmm?

INT. BOBBY'S LIVING ROOM – DAY

BOBBY
I'm gonna ask one more time. Are we absolutely sure we're doing the right thing?

DEAN
Bobby, you saw what was happening to him down there. The demon blood is killing him.

BOBBY
No, it isn't. We are.

DEAN
What?

BOBBY
I'm sorry. I can't bite my tongue any longer. We're killing him. Keeping him locked up down there. This cold-turkey thing isn't working. If—if he doesn't get what he needs, soon, Sam's not gonna last much longer.

DEAN
No. I'm not giving him demon blood. I won't do it.

BOBBY
And if he dies?

DEAN
Then at least he dies human!

INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – DAY

DEAN
I know why you really drink that blood, Sam.

SAM
Just leave me alone.

DEAN
Makes you feel strong. Invincible. A big bad wolf in a world of little pigs.

SAM
No. You're wrong, Dean.

DEAN
It's more than that, isn't it? It's because your whole life, you felt different. Am I right?

SAM
Stop.

DEAN
Oh, I hit a little close to home, huh? Not different because you were some lonely kid or because of your weirdo family.

SAM
Stop it.

DEAN
Because you're a monster.

SAM
Shut up! Just—shut. The hell. Up.

DEAN
You were always a monster. And you only feel right when you're sucking down more poison and more evil.

SAM rattles his chain.

INT. BOBBY'S LIVING ROOM – DAY

DEAN
I would die for him in a second, but I won't let him do this to himself. I can't. I guess I found my line. I won't let my brother turn into a monster.

INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – DAY

DEAN
Monster, Sam. You're a monster.

SAM
Dean, no.

DEAN
And I tried so hard to pretend that we were brothers. That you weren't one of the filthy things that we hunt. But we're not even the same species. You're nothing to me.

SAM
Don't say that to me. Don't you say that to me.

SAM looks around. The room is empty.

The lighting changes: nightfall.

The cuff on SAM's left arm snaps open, then his left ankle, then the other two. The door opens. SAM sits up, staring; he didn't do this.

SAM
Hello?

SAM gets up and slips out the door.

SAM
Someone here?

SAM hurries quietly out of the basement without noticing CASTIEL behind the stairs. From a distance, CASTIEL closes and locks the panic room door.

EXT. CITY RIVERFRONT – NIGHT

CASTIEL stands at a railing, looking over the water. The streetlights flicker. He turns; ANNA is there.

ANNA
What did you do?

CASTIEL
You shouldn't have come, Anna.

ANNA
Why would you let out Sam Winchester?

CASTIEL
Those were my orders.

ANNA
Orders? Cas, you saw him. He's drinking demon blood. It's so much worse than we thought. Dean was trying to stop him.

CASTIEL
You really shouldn't have come.

Two ANGELS appear on either side of ANNA. White light illuminates CASTIEL; when it is gone, so are the other three ANGELS. CASTIEL turns back to the river.

EXT. BOBBY'S SALVAGE YARD – NIGHT

SAM is working on stealing a car. A gun cocks. SAM turns.

BOBBY
Uh-uh, Sam. The only place you're going is back inside with me.

SAM
No.

BOBBY
Damn it, boy.

SAM
You won't shoot me, Bobby.

BOBBY
Don't test me.

SAM
You won't do it. You can't do it.

BOBBY
We're trying to help you, Sam.

SAM takes hold of BOBBY's shotgun so that BOBBY can't aim anywhere but point-blank at SAM.

SAM
Then shoot.

A long pause. SAM takes the gun and knocks BOBBY down, then throws the gun on the ground and returns to hotwiring the car. He drives off.

ACT THREE


INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM – NIGHT

BOBBY and DEAN unlock and open the panic room door.

DEAN
How the hell did he get out?

BOBBY
Maybe he had help. Room full of busted devil's traps.

DEAN
Demons? Ruby.

BOBBY
That'd be my guess.

DEAN
How did she even touch the door?

BOBBY
You think she's got the mojo?

DEAN
I didn't think so. I don't know, man.

BOBBY
What difference does it make? How he got gone ain't as important as where he got gone to.

DEAN
Well, I'll tell you one thing. At this point I hope he's with Ruby.

BOBBY
Why?

DEAN
'Cause killing her's the next big item on my to-do list.

BOBBY
I thought you were on call for angel duty.

DEAN
I am on call. In my car, on my way to murder the bitch.

DEAN leaves the room.

BOBBY
One thing.

DEAN
What?

BOBBY
Sam don't wanna be found, which means he's gonna be damn near impossible to find.

DEAN
Yeah, we'll see.

INT. NICE HOTEL ROOM – DAY

SAM sits in the corner, shaking. He gets up. Someone knocks on the door. He answers; it's RUBY.

RUBY
Honeymoon suite, really? I'm flattered.

SAM shuts the door behind her.

SAM
Did you bust me out of that room?

RUBY
How could I, Sam? The whole thing's engineered to bite me in the ass.

SAM
Then how did I get out of there?

RUBY
I don't know. I don't wanna know. You're out. That's all that matters. I'm glad you're here.

SAM
Yeah? Where the hell have you been?

RUBY
I got here as quick as I could.

SAM
I mean the past three weeks. I've been calling you.

RUBY
I've been pretty deep in it trying to dig out Lilith. Sometimes I can't sit around and check my voicemail. I'm sorry you're hurting. Really. I had no idea that Dean would do that to you.

SAM
You and me both.

RUBY
You didn't book this joint just to impress me, did you?

SAM
Dean's gonna come after me. And he knows my habits, my aliases, everything. He knows exactly which motel I'd pick.

RUBY
Hence the room.

SAM
Whatever it takes to shake him.

RUBY
It won't be easy. I mean, he knows you better than anyone.

SAM
Not as well as he thinks.

RUBY
You know, it's sad.

SAM
What?

RUBY
That things have gotten this bad between you two.

RUBY strokes SAM’s hair. SAM slams RUBY down onto the bed and leans over her, moving down her body until he finds the knife in her ankle sheath. He draws it and cuts her arm, then leans down to suck her blood. She smirks.

EXT. BOBBY'S SALVAGE YARD – DAY

BOBBY
Police found my car. Abandoned in an alley in Jamestown, North Dakota.

DEAN
He's switching up. Any other cars stolen in Jamestown?

BOBBY
Two. 1999 Honda Civic, blue. Nice and anonymous, like Sam likes.

DEAN
What was the other one?

BOBBY
White oh-five Escalade with custom rims. It's a neon sign.

DEAN
You're right. He'd never take that. Which is exactly what he did.

BOBBY
You think?

DEAN
I know that kid. All right, I'll head in that direction. You stay here, ride the police databases. We gotta find him quick.

INT. HONEYMOON SUITE – DAY

RUBY is lying in bed next to SAM, both of them wearing fewer layers than earlier.

RUBY
Your appetite's gotten much bigger.

SAM
What's that supposed to mean?

RUBY
Sam, relax. It's okay. It's good. Just means you're getting stronger, that's all. It means you're strong enough to kill Lilith. Just in time, too, because the final seals are breaking.

SAM
How many are left?

RUBY
Three...two...

SAM
What? Where are the angels?

RUBY
Screwing the pooch, wherever they are. The point is, it's looking more and more like we're getting down to the final seal. And I found out something big.

SAM
What?

RUBY
Seal sixty-six. It can't be broken by just any demon. Apparently, only Lucifer's first can do it.

SAM
Lucifer's first?

RUBY
Demon Sunday School story. God prefers humans to angels. Lucifer gets jealous and then he gets creative. And he twists and tempts a human soul into the very first demon as a 'screw you' to God. It's what got him locked up in the first place.

SAM
That was Lilith?

RUBY
She's way older than she looks.

SAM
Wait. So if Lilith is the only one who can break the final seal, if I get to her in time—

RUBY
Then Lucifer never busts out of his cage. Exactly.

SAM
Great. You figure out where she is?

RUBY
The bitch can hide. But I finally have a lead on someone who might be able to help us. I closed in on a member of Lilith's entourage. You might call her a personal chef.

SAM
Chef? Seriously? What does she eat?

RUBY
You don't wanna know.

INT. HOSPITAL

INTERCOM
X-ray head to Radiology.

BLONDE NURSE
Hear about that horrible thing at St. Paul's?

BRUNETTE NURSE
No.

BLONDE NURSE
One of the neonatal nurses walked right off the unit with two babies.

BRUNETTE NURSE
You are kidding me.

BLONDE NURSE
Swear to God. Worked there seventeen years. Then one day, out of the blue, she just does it.

The NURSES enter the baby-filled nursery.

BRUNETTE NURSE
That's just horrifying.

BLONDE NURSE
Now she's saying that she doesn't even remember what happened. Like she was possessed.

BRUNETTE NURSE
Heh, nuts.

BLONDE NURSE
I know. Who could ever lay a finger on them?

BRUNETTE NURSE
I know. They're just delicious.

The BRUNETTE NURSE's eyes go demon-black.

ACT FOUR


INT. HONEYMOON SUITE – NIGHT

SAM
So our demon gourmet nurse. You sure?

RUBY
She'll be there. Graveyard shift tomorrow night. Meantime, if you're gonna be strong enough to kill Lilith, you're gonna need more than I can give you now.

SAM sighs.

RUBY
Sam. Come on. It's okay.

SAM
I know I need more. I get it. I know it's okay. I just—I wish he'd trusted me, you know?

RUBY
Sorry.

SAM
I just hope...you know, when all this is over...I hope we can fix things.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT alternating with INT. DEAN'S CAR – NIGHT

BOBBY
Cops found the Escalade in a ditch outside Elk River.

DEAN
How far away am I?

BOBBY
A couple of hours. I pulled up a weather map, made some calls. There's a town not far from there, Cold Spring. Lighting up with demon sign.

DEAN
A good place to look.

BOBBY
Hey, listen.

DEAN
What?

BOBBY
Us finding Sam? It's gotta be about getting him back, not pushing him away.

DEAN
Right.

BOBBY
I know you're mad, Dean. I understand. You got a right to be, but I'm just saying. Be good to him anyway. You gotta get through to him.

DEAN hangs up.

INT. MOTEL HALLWAY – NIGHT

SAM leaves the motel room. DEAN, hidden, watches him go, then enters the room.

INT. HONEYMOON SUITE – NIGHT

RUBY is still in the room; she and DEAN fight. SAM reenters and defends her.

SAM
No. Let her go. Just take it easy.

DEAN
Well, it must've been some party you two had going, considering how hard you tried to keep me from crashing it. Well, solid try, but here I am.

SAM
Dean, I'm glad you're here. Look. Let's just talk about this.

DEAN
Soon as she's dead, we can talk all you want.

SAM
Ruby, get out of here.

DEAN
No, she's not going anywhere.

RUBY makes her escape. SAM watches her go.

DEAN
She's poison, Sam.

SAM
It's not what you think, Dean.

DEAN
Look what she did to you. I mean, she up and vanishes weeks at a time, leaves you cracking out for another hit—

SAM
She was looking for Lilith.

DEAN
That is French for manipulating your ass ten ways from Sunday.

SAM
You're wrong, Dean.

DEAN
Sam, you're lying to yourself. I just want you to be okay. You would do the same for me. You know you would.

SAM
Just listen.

SAM raises his hand, realizes he's still holding Ruby's knife that he took from DEAN, and tosses the knife on the bed.

SAM
Just listen for a second. We got a lead on a demon close to Lilith. Come with us, Dean. We'll do this together.

DEAN
That sounds great. As long as it's you and me. Demon bitch is a dealbreaker. You kiss her goodbye, we can go right now.

SAM
I can't.

DEAN turns away, nodding.

SAM
Dean, I need her to help me kill Lilith. I know you can't wrap your head around it, but maybe one day you'll understand. I'm the only one who can do this, Dean.

DEAN turns back around.

DEAN
No, you're not the one who's gonna do this.

SAM
Right, that's right, I forgot. The angels think it's you.

DEAN
You don't think I can?

SAM
No. You can't. You're not strong enough.

DEAN
And who the hell are you?

SAM
I'm being practical here. I'm doing what needs to be done.

DEAN
Yeah? You're not gonna do a single damn thing.

SAM
Stop bossing me around, Dean. Look. My whole life, you take the wheel, you call the shots, and I trust you because you are my brother. Now I'm asking you, for once, trust me.

DEAN
No. You don't know what you're doing, Sam.

SAM
Yes, I do.

DEAN
Then that's worse.

SAM
Why? Look, I'm telling you—

DEAN
Because it's not something that you're doing, it's what you are! It means—

DEAN cuts himself off.

SAM
What? No. Say it.

SAM has tears in his eyes.

DEAN
It means you're a monster.

SAM nods. A tear falls from DEAN's eye; SAM doesn't see it before he punches DEAN. DEAN goes down hard, then gets back up and watches SAM for a moment before punching back.

ACT FIVE


INT. HONEYMOON SUITE – NIGHT

SAM and DEAN fight, SAM dominating. Anything in the room that can break does. DEAN hits the floor and doesn't get up. SAM pins him down, choking him, then lets go.

SAM
You don't know me. You never did. And you never will.

SAM walks away.

DEAN
You walk out that door, don't you ever come back.

SAM stops at the door and turns back, then leaves.
