TEASER

INT. SHOWERS - NIGHT
A woman, CANDACE, is in the shower as a naked teenage boy watches. As CANDACE turns around, the boy disappears. She gets out of the shower and we see evidence of an invisible presence: a hand print appears on the glass and footprints appear on the ground.

CANDACE
Hello? Is anybody there?

CANDACE tosses a towel behind her and it gets suspended in the air, over the head of the invisible boy.

INVISIBLE PERVERT GUY
Um, hello? Mrs. Armstrong?


ACT ONE

INT. BAR - NIGHT
SAM and DEAN are sitting at a table. DEAN is downing shots.

SAM
It just doesn't make any sense, Dean. I mean, why would Uriel tell me you remembered Hell if you didn't?

DEAN
Maybe because he's a dick. Might have something to do with it.

SAM
Maybe, but he's still an angel.

DEAN
Yeah, an angel who was ready to level an entire town. Look, I don't know what --

CHEERFUL WAITER
Radical. What else can I get you guys?

SAM
Uh, I think we're good.

CHEERFUL WAITER
Yeah?

SAM
Yeah

CHEERFUL WAITER
You want to try a couple of fryer bombs? Or a chipotle chili changa?

DEAN
No, no, we're – we're still good.

CHEERFUL WAITER
Okay, awesome.

DEAN
Sam, honestly, I have no idea why Uriel told you what he did, okay?

SAM
Right.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Okay. Fine. Then look me in the eye and tell me you don't remember a thing from your time down under.

DEAN
I don't remember a thing from my time down under. I don't remember, Sam!

SAM
Look, Dean, I just want to help.

DEAN
You know everything I do. Okay? That's all there is.

CHEERFUL WAITER
Outstanding. Dessert time? Huh? Am I right?

DEAN
Dude.

CHEERFUL WAITER
Listen, bros. You have got to try our ice cream extreme. It's extreme.

SAM
Uh, no extremities, please. Just the --

CHEERFUL WAITER
Check? All right, awesome.

SAM
Thanks.

DEAN
All right, so, where do we go from here?

SAM
I'm not sure. Uh, looks like it's been pretty quiet lately. No signs of demon activity, no omens or portents I can see.

DEAN
That's good news for once.

SAM
Yeah, just the typical smattering of crank UFO sightings and one possible vengeful spirit. Here, check this out. Uh... Up in Concrete, Washington, eyewitness reports of a ghost that's been haunting the showers of a women's health facility. [DEAN chokes with his beer] The victim claims that the ghost threw her down a flight of stairs. I can see you're very interested.

DEAN
Women, showers. We got to save these people.

EXT. CONCRETE STREET - DAY
DEAN drops SAM off in front of Lucky Chin's Chinese Restaurant.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

CANDACE
I'm not surprised the spirit world chose to make contact with me. I'm something of a... natural sensitive.

SAM
I can sense that about you, Candace, that whole... sensitive thing.

CANDACE
So, what did you say you're calling your book?

SAM
Oh, well, um... Well, the working title is... "Supernatural." Yeah, I've been crossing the country, gathering stories like yours. But, anyways, you were telling me about your encounter.

CANDACE
Yes. Well... [sighs] Once I saw the apparition, that's when I started to run.

SAM gets distracted by a couple kissing at another table

SAM
And you said the ghost chased you?

CANDACE
Not just that. It knew my name. It kept yelling, "Mrs. Armstrong! Mrs. Armstrong!" And that's when I hit the stairs and fell.

SAM
You fell? The ghost didn't push you?

CANDACE
Oh, I don't – I don't know. I mean, I think it did. Maybe.

SAM
Did you feel like it meant to hurt you, like it was violent, or...

CANDACE
It was a ghost. I'm lucky to be alive. Anyway, I was at the bottom of the stairs, and that's when it got weird. [Chuckles] It helped me up.

SAM
Say again?

CANDACE
Yeah. It helped me up. And it kept saying over and over, "Please, don't tell my mom."

SAM
Yeah, that's weird.

EXT. FITNESS CENTER - DAY
DEAN is reading the local newspaper on the stairs of the Fitness Center. The headline says: Local Man Wins $168M Lottery.

SAM
Well, you pick up anything?

DEAN
No EMF in the shower or anywhere else. This house is clean.

SAM
Yeah. I'm not surprised. I kind of got the feeling back there that crazy pushed Mrs. Armstrong down the stairs.

DEAN
I got to tell you, I'm pretty disappointed.

SAM
[Exhales sharply] You wanted to save naked women.

DEAN
Damn right I wanted to save some naked women.

SAM chuckles lightly.

Three bullies are chasing one boy.

BULLY BOY #1
Come on, guys, get him!

BULLY BOY #2
I got him! I got him!

DEAN
Run, Forrest, run!

SAM
Sorry, Dean, but I don't think anything's going on around here.

A man is arguing with a police officer on the pier.

GUS
How the hell was I supposed to get a look at it? It grabbed me from behind and threw me into a tree!

DEAN
Something's going on.

POLICE OFFICER
Yeah, okay, Gus. I understand you got shook up. Anyone would be. But don't you think it – Don't you think it had to be a bear?

GUS
I know a damn bear track when I see one! This thing didn't leave bear tracks! Its feet were huge!

POLICE OFFICER
Now, Gus...

GUS
It was Bigfoot, Hal – The Bigfoot!

POLICE OFFICER
Gus, you're not talking sense here.

GUS
There's a Bigfoot out there, damn it, and he's a son of a bitch!

SAM
Excuse us. FBI.

POLICE OFFICER
What?

SAM
Yes, sir. We're here about the... That.

POLICE OFFICER
About Bigfoot?

SAM
That's right. Sir, can you tell me exactly where this happened?

GUS
Yes, I can.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

DEAN
What the hell's going on in this town? First there's a ghost that's not real, and now a Bigfoot sighting?

SAM
Well, every hunter worth his salt knows Bigfoot's a hoax.

DEAN
Well, maybe somebody's pumping LSD into the town water supply.

SAM and DEAN find huge tracks.

DEAN
Okay. What do you suppose made that?

SAM
That, uh... is a big foot.

DEAN
Okay.

They follow the tracks to the back of a liquor store that has been broken into.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

DEAN
So, what – Bigfoot breaks into a liquor store, jonesing for some hooch? Amaretto and Irish cream. He's a girl-drink drunk.

DEAN helps himself to a bottle of something on the shelves, and puts it into his jacket pocket.

SAM
Hey. Check this out.

DEAN
He took the whole porno rack? Well, I'll say it again. What the hell is going on in this town?

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY
SAM and DEAN sit down on a bench outside the store.

DEAN
I got nothing.

SAM
It's got to be a joke, right? Some big-ass mother in a gorilla suit?

DEAN
Or it's a Bigfoot. You know, and he's some kind of a alcoholo-porno addict. Kind of like a deep-woods Duchovny.

A girl on a bike passes SAM and DEAN, and a Busty Asian Beauties magazine falls to the ground from the box on the bicycle.

DEAN
A little young for busty Asian beauties.

The girl, AUDREY, drops off a box full of alcohol and porn, along with a "Sorry" note, at the back door of the liquor store. SAM and DEAN follow her home.

EXT. AUDREY'S HOUSE - DAY

DEAN
What's this, like a "Harry and the Hendersons" deal?

AUDREY
Hello?

SAM
Hello! Um, could we... You know what? Are your parents home?

AUDREY
Nope.

SAM
No.

DEAN
No. Um... Have you seen a really, really furry...

AUDREY
Is he in trouble?

SAM
No. [Chuckling] No, no, no. Not at all. We just – We wanted to make sure he was okay.

DEAN
Exactly.

AUDREY
He's my teddy bear. I think he's sick.

DEAN
Wow. Uh... Amazing. 'Cause you know what? We... are, uh... teddy bear doctors.

AUDREY
Really? Can you please take a look at him?

SAM
Sure.

DEAN
Sure. Yeah.

INT. AUDREY'S HOUSE - DAY
SAM and DEAN follow AUDREY inside the house and upstairs.

AUDREY
He's in my bedroom. He's pretty grumpy. [knocking on the door] Teddy? There's some nice doctors here to see you.

She opens the door to reveal a real, big and drunk teddy that is watching television.

TEDDY
Close the friggin' door!

AUDREY closes the door

AUDREY
See what I mean?

SAM and DEAN look at each other.

ACT TWO

INT. AUDREY'S HOUSE - DAY

AUDREY
All I ever wanted was a teddy which was big, real, and talked. But now he's sad all the time – not "ouch" sad, but ouch-in-the-head sad – says weird stuff, and smells like the bus.

DEAN
Um, little girl...

AUDREY
Audrey!

DEAN
Audrey. How exactly did your teddy become real?

AUDREY
I wished for it.

SAM
You wished for it?

AUDREY
At the wishing well.

DEAN opens the bedroom door. TEDDY is watching the news on the TV.

TEDDY
Look at this. [Chuckling] You believe this crap?

DEAN
Not really.

TEDDY
It is a terrible world. Why am I here?!

AUDREY
For tea parties!

TEDDY
Tea parties? Is that all there is? [Guns firing on TV]

SAM and DEAN step out of the room for a minute, and back into the hall.

SAM
Audrey, give us a second, okay? Okay. Are we... Should we... Uh, are we gonna kill this teddy bear?

DEAN
How? Do we shoot it, burn it?

SAM
I don't know. Both?

DEAN
How do we even know that's gonna work? I don't want some giant, flaming, pissed-off teddy on our hands.

SAM
Yeah. Besides, I get the feeling that the bear isn't really the, you know, core problem here. Audrey. Where are your parents?

AUDREY
My mom wished they were in Bali, so I think they're in Bali.

SAM
Okay, well... I'm really sorry to have to break this to you, but... your bear is sick. Yeah, he's – he's got...

DEAN
Lollipop disease.

SAM
Lollipop disease.

DEAN
It's not uncommon for a bear his size. But, see, it's – it’s really contagious.

SAM
Yeah, so, is there – is there someone, maybe a grown-up, that you can stay with while we treat him?

AUDREY
Mrs. Hurley lives down the street.

DEAN
Perfect.

SAM
Good, yeah, good. Uh, we'd like you to stay there for a few days, okay?

AUDREY
Okay.

DEAN
Oh, and, Audrey? Where is this wishing well?

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY
A boy throws a coin into the fountain and leaves as SAM and DEAN arrive.

DEAN
Think it works?

SAM
Got a better explanation for teddy back there?

DEAN
Well, there's one way to find out.

SAM
What are you gonna wish for?

DEAN
Shh! [throws a coin] Not supposed to tell.

DELIVERY GUY
Somebody order a footlong Italian with jalapeño?

DEAN
That'd be me.

SAM and DEAN are sitting at a table and DEAN is eating the sandwich.

DEAN
I think it works, dude. That was pretty specific.

SAM
The teddy bear, the sandwich...

DEAN
Mm. I'm guessing this. [shows the newspaper article about the lottery winner]

SAM
I'm guessing that. [points out the couple at the next table]

DEAN
Well, that definitely goes on the list. What are we supposed to do, huh? Stop people's wishes from coming true? I mean, it sounds like kind of a douche-y thing to do.

SAM
Yeah, maybe. But come on, man. When has something like this ever come without a price tag? And usually a deadly one.

DEAN
I don't know. It's a damn good sandwich. All right. Fine. We'll put a hold on the wishing till we figure out what's going on.

CHINESE WAITER
Uh, gentlemen, gentlemen. I'm sorry. We don't allow people to eat outside food here.

DEAN
Well, I am certainly not gonna eat the inside food here. Health department. You, my friend, have a rat infestation. We're gonna have to shut this place down under emergency hazard code 56C.

CHINESE WAITER
Rats?!

The fountain has been drained. DEAN is sweeping the coins.

DEAN
Typical fountain, plaster Buddha. Nothing I can see.

CHINESE WAITER
Yes, nothing. We keep a clean place here.

SAM
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave during the preliminary investigation, okay? Thank you.

DEAN
Oh, come on. Aren't you a little bit tempted? [flips SAM a coin]

SAM
[Chuckles] No. [hands the coin back to DEAN] Wouldn't be real. I wouldn't trust it.

DEAN
I don't know. That bear seemed pretty real.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Come on, if you could wish yourself back, you know, before it all started... Think about it. You'd be some big yuppie lawyer with a nice car and a white picket fence.

SAM
Not what I'd wish for.

DEAN
Seriously?

SAM
It's too late to go back to our old lives, Dean. I'm not that guy anymore.

DEAN
All right, well, what, then? Hmm? What would Sammy wish for?

SAM
Lilith's head on a plate. Bloody.

DEAN
Okay. What is that?

SAM
Some kind of old coin. I don't recognize the markings.

DEAN
[tries to pick it up] Damn.

SAM
Lift with your legs.

DEAN
Is that little mother welded on there? Huh.

SAM and DEAN come back to the restaurant with a hammer and a crowbar.

CHINESE WAITER
Hey, hey, hey, what is this?! You are gonna break my fountain!

SAM
Sir, I don't want to slap you with a 44/16, but I will. [The waiter leaves them alone] All right, thanks.

DEAN
Let me see that. I got an idea.

DEAN tries to budge the coin from the fountain, but breaks the hammer.

CHINESE WAITER
Ho!

DEAN
Damn!

SAM
Coin's magical.

DEAN
Boy, I'd say. I think it's hoodoo that's protecting the well. I don't think we can destroy this.

SAM traces the coin and gives the paper to DEAN

SAM
All right, here. You got to look into this.

DEAN
Where you going?

SAM
Something just occurred to me.

INT. SHOWERS - DAY
There is a blonde woman wearing only a towel and we see some wet footprints. SAM grabs the shoulder of the INVISIBLE PERVERT GUY and he appears, completely naked.

WOMEN
Aah!

INVISIBLE PERVERT GUY
What?

SAM
Don't worry, ma'am. I'm with the health department.

The woman leaves.

SAM
So, you can turn it on and off, huh?

INVISIBLE PERVERT GUY
How... how did you know that I was...

SAM
You actually walked up to a wishing well, dropped a dime, and wished to be invisible so you could spy on women in the shower?

INVISIBLE PERVERT GUY
N-No. No. N-No, no, no. That's crazy.

SAM
[Exhales sharply] Put on some pants. And stay visible.

INVISIBLE PERVERT GUY
O-- Okay.

EXT. STREET - DAY
TODD is chasing the bullies.

TODD
You better run!

TODD stops and turns around to confront DEAN.

TODD
You got a problem, mister?

DEAN
What? No.

DEAN puts a hand to his stomach.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
SAM comes into the room and hears DEAN being sick in the bathroom.

SAM
Dean? You all right?

DEAN
[Strained voice] The wishes turn bad, Sam. The wishes turn very bad.

SAM
The sandwich, huh?

DEAN
The coin was Babylonian. It's cursed. I found some fragments of a legend. [looks unwell again; turns to gag in the bathroom; returns] I'm good. The, uh... the serpent is Tiamat, which is the, uh, Babylonian god of primordial chaos. I guess their, uh, priests were working some serious black magic.

SAM
They made the coin?

DEAN
Yeah, to sow the seeds of chaos. Whoever tosses a coin in the wishing well, makes a wish, it turns on the well. Then it starts granting wishes to all comers.

SAM
But the wishes get twisted. You ask for a talking teddy...

DEAN
You get a bipolar nut job.

SAM
And you get E. coli.

DEAN
Mm. This thing has turned more than one town upside down over the centuries. It's even wiped a few off the map. I mean, one person gets their wish, it's trouble, but everybody gets their wish...

SAM
It's chaos.

DEAN
Mm-hmm.

SAM
Any way to stop it?

DEAN
Yeah. One way. We got to find the first wisher. Whoever dropped the coin in and made the first wish, they're the only ones who can pull it back out and reverse the wishes. So for now, we've got a couple of nutso dreams come true, but once the word gets out about the well, things are just gonna get crazier and crazier.

INT. AUDREY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
A blackboard reads “Life is meaningless. Signed T. Bear.” TEDDY is crying. He puts a shotgun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Some of the stuffing blows away through a hole in his head but TEDDY is still alive.

TEDDY
Whyyyyyyy!!


ACT THREE

INT. MOTEL ROOM.
DEAN is asleep, having a nightmare about Hell, while SAM is awake doing some research.

SAM
Dean, wake up!

DEAN
What? I'm up. What?

SAM
Sleep well?

DEAN
Yeah. [drinks from a whiskey bottle on the floor next to the bed] Tan, rested, and ready.

SAM
Dean, come on, man. You think I can't see it?

DEAN
See what?

SAM
The nightmares, the drinking. I'm with you 24/7. I know something's going on.

DEAN
Sam, please.

SAM
Uriel wasn't lying, but you are. You remember Hell, don't you?

DEAN
What do you want from me, huh? What?

SAM
The truth, Dean. I mean, I'm your brother. I, I just wish you'd talk to me.

DEAN
Careful what you wish for.

SAM
Cute.

DEAN
Come on, can we stow the couples therapy, huh? We're on a job. I want to work. What do you got? Please?


SAM (sighing, while DEAN turns to the paper)
We got teddy bear, uh, lottery guy, invisible pervert guy. They all must have wished sometime in the last two weeks. But who wished first, and how are we supposed to know who else wished for what when?

DEAN
Well, it helps when they announce it in the paper. Goes back a month.

SAM
Wesley Mondale and Ms. Hope Lynn Casey have announced their surprise engagement.

DEAN
Ah, true love.

SAM
[Chuckles] Best lead we got.

INT. WESLEY’S HOUSE - DAY
[Mid-Tempo theme song playing on TV] WES is sleeping in an armchair. HOPE comes in from the kitchen with a roast chicken on a plate.

HOPE
Wes, are you sleeping?

WES
Hmm? Oh, uh, no. No, no. I was just, um. I was just resting my eyes.

HOPE
[Chuckles] I thought you might want a snack.

WES
Oh. Oh, wow, Hope, you didn't have to do that.

HOPE
I wanted to. Well, no, I... I had to. Because I love you more than anything, lover.

WES
Yes. Um, Hope, sit down, okay?

HOPE
Yes, Wes.

WES
Um... Hope, uh, are you happy?

HOPE
I love you more than anything.

WES
I know. I know. And I love you. Very much. That's why I want you to start doing things that make... that made you happy before.

HOPE
Yes, Wes, I'll try to be happier. I'll start right away.

WES
No, no, no, that's not what I mean. I-I'm talk—

HOPE
Oh, Wes, please. [Voice breaking] Please don't be angry with me. You know, I'd just die, I'd just die, I'd die!

WES
No, no, no. Don't – I'm – I'm not angry. I'm not angry! No.

HOPE
Then let me make it up to you, Wes. Let me make it right.

WES
No, no, I'm – I'm...

The doorbell rings.

HOPE
I'll get it. Wes! You didn't tell me that you called the florists for the wedding.

HOPE comes back, followed by SAM and DEAN.

WES
Huh?

HOPE
You're the best! Mmm! Ah! I'm gonna go get my folders.

WES
Uh, o-- Okay.

DEAN
Wesley, how's it going?

WES
It's "Wes... ss." Aren't you the guys from the health department?

SAM
Yeah. And florists on the side.

DEAN
Plus FBI. And on Thursdays, we're teddy bear doctors.

WES
Huh?

DEAN
Doesn't matter who we are. What matters is what we know.

SAM
So, coin collector, huh, Wes?

WES
Oh. Yeah. My... grandfather gave them to me.

DEAN
Did you happen to lose one of those coins lately? And by "lose," I mean drop into a wishing well at Lucky Chin's and make a wish on it?

WES
No, I – I don't know what you're, uh, talking about.

HOPE comes back with lots of papers and folders.

HOPE
Okay, now. I have a lot of ideas, but, you know, we don't have all the money in the world. Wes is between jobs right now. Means more time for me. You know, I'm thinking a Japanese-y ikebana kind of thing.

DEAN
Yes. I can see it.

SAM
Yeah. So, Hope, uh, tell us how you two lovebirds met.

HOPE
Oh, best day of my life.

DEAN
I bet.

HOPE
Yeah! It's the funniest thing. We both grew up here, but I never really knew who he was. Not by name anyway. Until one day last month, it was like I just [sighs] I just saw him for the first time. He was just... glowing. Oh, just glowing.

WES
Uh, babe, can you – can you get us some coffee?

HOPE
Yes. Yeah.

HOPE kisses WES over and over.

WES
Oh. Okay. Okay. Mm-Hmm. Okay. Oh, okay. Oh. Mm-mmm, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

HOPE
Yeah.

SAM
Wes, we know. So tell us the truth.

HOPE is listening to WES from the kitchen as he tells the history.

WES
My – my grandfather found the coin in north Africa, you know, World War II. And, uh, he brought it back. He, um, he said it was a real wish-granting coin, but that nobody should ever use it. Um... It was all I had, and when he died, I thought, "Well, you know what? Why not give the coin a shot?"

SAM
Yeah, well, now you're gonna wish it back.

WES
Oh. [chuckles] Oh. Ha ha, no, I'm not.

DEAN
If you don't stop it, something bad's gonna happen.

SAM
Something bad. Like us.

DEAN
We really wish you'd come with us.

EXT. IMPALA - DAY
DEAN is driving, beside him is SAM and WES is in the back seat.

WES
I don't get it. So, my wish came true. Why does that have to be a bad thing?

SAM
Because the wishes go south, Wes. Your town is going insane.

DEAN
Come on. You're gonna sit there and tell me that your relationship with Hope is functional, that it's what you wished for?

WES
I wished she would love me more than anything.

SAM
Yeah, and, uh, how is that going? That seem healthy to you?

WES
Well, it's a hell of a lot better than when she didn't know I was alive.

DEAN
You're not supposed to get what you want, man, not like this. Nobody is. That's what the coin does. It takes your heart's desires and it twists it back on you. You hear of the whole, uh, "be careful what you wish for"?

SAM
Did we just hit something?

DEAN
I didn't see anything.

INVISIBLE PERVERT GUY
Ow! Ow.

WES
[Mockingly] "Careful what you wish for." [Normal voice] You know who says that? Good-looking jerks like you guys, the ones who've got it so easy because you happen to be handsome.

SAM
Easy?

DEAN
Easy?

WES
Yeah. Women – women look at you, right? They notice you.

SAM
Believe us, we do not have it easy.

DEAN
We are miserable. We never get what we want. In fact, we have to fight tooth and nail just to keep whatever it is we got.

SAM
But you know what? Maybe that's the whole point, Wes.

DEAN
Yeah, people are people 'cause they're miserable bastards, 'cause they never get what they really want.

SAM
Right, yeah, you get what you want, you get crazy.

DEAN
Take a look at Michael Jackson, hmm? Or Hasselhoff.

WES
You know what? Hope loves me now – completely. And it's awesome. Besides, look around. Where's all this, uh, insanity you guys were talking about?

The bully boys are inside a large four-wheel-drive.

BULLY BOY #1
Just hit the button!

TODD lifts the vehicle up. DEAN stops the Impala.

DEAN
Well, that should cover it.

TODD tips the vehicle over.

TODD
Kneel before Todd! Kneel before Todd!

ACT FOUR

EXT. STREET. DAY
TODD is rocking the vehicle with the boys still inside.

BULLY BOYS
Stop it!

DEAN gets out of the Impala.

DEAN
Fine! I'll handle Todd. You get Wes to Lucky Chin's. Go!

SAM
Right.

SAM drives away as DEAN confronts TODD.

DEAN
Hey, kid! Can I talk to you for a second?

TODD
Get out of my way!

DEAN
Okay. Hey, I can dig it, Todd. It – it's Todd, right? Look, I-I know the score. Okay? They're – they're bullying you.

TODD
Every day. Every day! You do not know what it's like!

DEAN
No, no, I don't. But, you know, you're you and I'm me, so— [chuckles]

TODD
Couldn't stop them. I couldn't do anything. Then Audrey Elmer told me the wishing well worked.

DEAN
Okay, okay. Look – look, I get it. They're – they're mean little jerks, huh? But they're not superhuman like you. You see, with great power comes great respon... Ohh!

TOOD punches DEAN and throws him into some garbage cans and trash bags.

EXT. OUTSIDE CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY
SAM parks in front of the Lucky Chin's and he and WES get out.

WES
That – that – that kid turned over that car like – like it was nothing.

SAM
You should have seen the teddy bear. Now, come on. Fun's over. Time to pull the coin. Wes!

WES
Well, why can't we just get what we want?!

SAM
Because that's life, Wes.

A lightning bolt strikes SAM and he falls dead.

SAM
Ugh!

WES goes into the restaurant.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY
HOPE is in front of the wishing well.

WES
Hope?

HOPE
I had to do it, didn't I? He was gonna make you wish away our love.

EXT. STREET - DAY
DEAN gets up from the garbage.

DEAN
Hey, kid! I didn't want to have to do this. [punches TODD, who doesn’t move] Ohh!

TODD puts a hand around DEAN’s throat and starts to choke him.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

WES
You wished a man dead?

HOPE
I love you more than anything.

WES
Stop saying that. Stop it!

HOPE
[Voice breaking] But I do. More than anything. More than me. More than life. Oh, Wes. Don't hate me.

WES
It'll be okay. I'll make it okay. It's gonna be okay.

WES removes the coin from the fountain, reversing all the wishes. TODD isn't strong anymore and lets DEAN go. SAM wakes up.

EXT. STREET - DAY
DEAN
Okay. Follow my lead and you won't have a problem. Come on.

DEAN acts in front of the bully boys as if he's scared of TODD.

DEAN
Okay, man, no more! No more, okay? [turns to the kids] I wouldn't mess with this kid any more if I were you.

BULLY BOYS
Stay back!

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

WES
Hope.

HOPE doesn't recognize Wes.

HOPE
Do I know you? [she leaves]

EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY
A dejected WES gives the coin to SAM and leaves.


ACT FIVE
EXT. PIER. DAY
DEAN is reading the local newspaper. The headline says: “Winning Lottery Ticket A Fake”. AUDREY walks past, followed by her sunburned parents. She's carrying a normal-sized teddy with a hole in his head and a sticking plaster on it.

SAM
Well, uh, coin's melted down. It shouldn't cause any more problems.

DEAN
Audrey's parents are back from Bali. Looks like all the wishes are gone. And so are we.

They're leaving when suddenly DEAN stops.

DEAN
Hang on a second.

SAM
What?

DEAN
You were right.

SAM
About what?

DEAN
I shouldn't have lied to you. I do remember everything that happened to me in the Pit. Everything.

SAM
So tell me about it.

DEAN
No.

SAM
Uh...

DEAN
I won't lie anymore. But I'm not gonna talk about it.

SAM
Dean, look, you can't just shoulder this thing alone. You got to let me help.

DEAN
How? Do you really think that a little heart-to-heart, some sharing and caring, is gonna change anything? Hmm? Somehow... heal me? I'm not talking about a bad day here.

SAM
I know that.

DEAN
The things that I saw... there aren't words. There is no forgetting. There's no making it better. Because it is right here... [taps his head] forever. You wouldn't understand. And I could never make you understand. So I am sorry.
