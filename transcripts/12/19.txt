NOW:

Kelly, sitting against wall in basement

Dagon: Hey. Vitamin time.

Kelly slaps hand

Dagon: Don't. (shoves pills in Kelley's mouth)

Kelly: (Muffled voice) No. (Whimpering)

Dagon: (Singsongy) Be a good girl.

(Muffled shouting, grunting) (Chain rattling)

Dagon: There. (Scoffs) Really, Kel?

Kelly: (Swallows, coughs)

Dagon: Not taking your pills, picking at your food, refusing to bathe?

Kelly: (Coughs)

Dagon: (Sighs heavily) Stop disrespecting the God inside of you.

Kelly: (Whispers) He's gonna kill me.

Dagon: Yeah. And he's not gonna stop there. Every sad, weak human, every tight-ass angel, every sniveling demon they'll all be consumed. So go ahead. Play your games. But whether you're healthy or sick, filthy or clean, He will be born. Good times.

But until then (Unlocks cuff) Do us both a favor? Take a bath.

Dagon leaves (Ascending footsteps) (Sniffling) (Whimpers) (Chains rattle, door closes)

Kelly: (Groans) (Sniffles, sighs) I love you. (fills tub) But we won't ever be together. There is no happy ending for either of us. And if what she said is true if this is what you really are (Voice breaking) what you'll do to the world, all that pain, all that death, I can't let that happen. (Crying) I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

(Laying in tub, Slices her arm) (Grunts, gasps) Oh.(Gasps) (Grunts) (Shard clatters)

Scene fades to Kelly laying in tub



Title Card: Supernatural



(Montage: In bunker, Sam researching.)



(Sam at Map table, Dean approaches)

Dean: What's up, Beautiful Mind?

Sam: Guess I just figured we can't exactly track Dagon, so I've been reading up on Nephilim, trying to figure out how much time we have before –

Dean: 'Lil Lucifer pops?

Sam: Yeah. Okay, so we know Kelly got pregnant sometime in early December. According to the lore, Nephilim don't need 9 months to get to full term, so I think she will be giving birth around May 18th.

Which means –

Dean: We have less than a month to find her.

Sam: Yeah, and exactly no idea where to start.

Dean: Okay, but even if we do find her, what then?

Sam: I don't know. I mean, I-I

(Bunker Door opens)

Sam: Cass.

Castiel: Hello.

Sam: Hey. You're all right. Um – Where have you been?

Dean: Let me rephrase that for Sam. Where the hell have you been? And why have you ignored our phone calls?

Castiel: Where I was, the – the reception was, uh, poor.

Dean: No bars? No bars. That's his excuse. Wow.

Castiel: I was in Heaven. I was working with the angels. When I saw Dagon had captured Kelly, I-I thought they could help.

Sam: And?

Castiel: Nothing.

Sam: Well, at least you're back. We're glad you're back.

Dean: Really? No, I'm sorry. Okay, 'cause while you were striking out in Heaven, we had a shot at Dagon, and we lost.

Castiel: I know. I received your messages.

Dean: Oh, you did – you did receive the messages? Okay, that's good.

Castiel: Dean.

Dean: So not only were you ditching us, but you were also ignoring us? That's great. 'Cause we really could've used the backup. But, uh, you were too busy with, um (Clicks tongue) What was it? Nothing? Castiel: Dean, I –

Dean: What the hell is wrong with you, man? You know, whatever. That's (Chuckles) Yeah. Welcome back. (walks away)

Sam: Dean, y—



(Dean on laptop in his room) (Knock on door) (Door opens)

Castiel: Sorry, Dean. Um I just wanted to return this.

(hands Dean a cassette)

Dean: It's a gift. You keep those.

Castiel: Oh.

Dean: Cass, you can't – With everything that's going on, you can't just go dark like that. We didn't know what happened to you. We were worried. That's not okay.

Castiel: Well, I didn't mean to add to your distress. I – Dean, I just keep failing. Again and again. When you were taken, I searched for months and I couldn't find you. And then Kelly escaped on my watch, and I couldn't find her. And I just wanted I needed to come back here with a win for you. For myself.

Dean: You think you're the only one rolling snake eyes here? Me and Sam, we had her. We had Kelly and we lost her.

Castiel: And if you find her again?

Dean: Sam's working on it. Of course, he's hell-bent on finding something that doesn't mean killing her or her kid.

Castiel: Right. And if he doesn't find something? If you run out of time, could either of you kill an innocent?

Dean: We will find a better way.

Castiel: You mean, we?

Dean: Yes, dumbass. We. You, me, and Sam, we're just better together. So now that you're back, let's go, Team Free Will. Let's get it done.

Castiel: I'd like that.

Dean: Great. And I'd like a beer.



(Back at safehouse with Dagon and Kelly)

(Door opens – Dagon finds tub, covered in blood. Kelly sits on floor against wall, her arms are healed)

Dagon: What did you do?

Kelly: He wouldn't let me die.



(Back at Bunker. Sam at library tables, Dean approaches, Sighs)

Dean: Hey, come on, man. Get some sleep, all right? You're not gonna find Dagon tonight.

Sam: Dean, what if we've been going about this whole thing the wrong way, you know? I-I mean, we – we can't track Dagon, right? We know that. We've tried. But – but what if we can track the Nephilim?

Dean: (Clears throat) How?

Sam: Well Okay, the baby's half-angel, right? So remember Gadreel?

Dean: The psycho angel who took your body for a test drive? Yeah, what about him?

Sam: All right, well there was this, uh, there was this spell – Cass and I were working on it – to – to find him.

Dean: Yeah, but it didn't work.

Sam: Yeah.

Dean: You needed Gadreel's grace, and he couldn't yank enough out of you.

Sam: (Chuckles) Of course.

Dean: Of course what?

Sam: Of course I am an idiot.

Dean: Well, there's no argument there.

Sam: No, stop. Dean – the grace extraction. The tracking spell was a bust, right?

Sam: But, but the extraction ritual worked.

Dean: So?

Sam: So what if Cass used it on Kelly's kid? I mean, a-a Nephilim's just a human soul with angelic grace, right? So you remove the grace –

Dean: Kid's just a kid.

Sam: Kid's just a kid. That way, Kelly wouldn't have to die, and – and neither would her baby.

Dean: Hot damn.

Sam: Hot damn. I mean, we still obviously have to find Kelly in the first place. And, it's just a theory, but –

Dean: No, no, no. No. That's – This is it. This is it, Sam.

Sam: (Chuckles)

Dean: I'll get Cass.

(Dean knocks on Castiel's door)

Dean: Cass? Yo, Cass? (Switch clicks, door thuds – Castiel is gone)



(Back at house with Dagon/Kelly)

Dagon: You really thought that was gonna work? You get the chance to be Mary of Nazareth, Part 2, Evil Jesus Edition.

Kelly: He's not.

Dagon: Excuse me?

Kelly: He's not. My baby's not evil. He saved me.

Dagon: That's what you think happened? (Laughs) Uh, he saved himself. He doesn't care about you.

Nothing's changed. He's born, you die. But don't worry. I'll be there, right by his side, to nurture him, love him, to help him to kill everything. You know, like a mother should.



(Castiel in truck in quiet neighborhood, gets out of truck)

Castiel: (Sighs)

Kelvin: Hello, brother. Is it done?

Castiel: Yes. (hands Kelvin the COLT)

Kelvin: Bullets?

Castiel: There were only two in the chamber, and I couldn't exactly ask for more.

Kelvin: It's enough. One for Dagon

Castiel: Yeah. One for Kelly.

Kelvin: They're close. The celestial pulse we felt, Joshua tracked it to a house nearby.

(Castiel Cellphone rings) (Dean on the display, Castiel rejects the call.)

Kelvin: You're doing the right thing, you know. Committing to Joshua's plan, putting angelkind above the Winchesters. I mean, your reputation in Heaven is –

Castiel: This has nothing to do with my reputation. I am doing this for the Winchesters.

I-I stole the Colt to keep them out of this mission and to keep them safe from Dagon, and I – I will kill this girl so that Sam and Dean don't have to.

(Another angel appears) Castiel: Hozai.

Hozai: Castiel. Dagon, the girl, they're in the house.

Kelvin: Showtime.



(Kelly sleeping on sofa in basement, Dagon watching TV in ground floor living room)

TV voice: And now we've got 5 seconds to see more of the Super Catch Phrase and win the bank.

Here we go. (Bell dings) Cindy, for $350, tell us what it is.

Cindy: Pumping iron? Not right.

(Audience groans) (Laughs) Chip and Cindy – Got a lot of people in the audience who think they know, but we have a Toss Up Catch Phrase for you. (Bell dings) Now your opponent knows, but she can't guess. Only you are entitled. There's $400 in the bank. Chip, what is it?

Chip: The Iron Curtain!

Tv voice: No! (Laughs) Yes! (Laughs) Whoo! (Cheers and applause) I got so excited there myself …



(Castiel sneaking through house approaches behind Dagon's chair) (Cocks gun)

… TV Voice continues: that I went to the opposite thing.

(Castiel comes around I front of chair, brings the COLT to bear; chair is empty)



(from behind Castiel)

Dagon: Well, whatcha know? (Castiel whirls, fires – Dagon teleports)

Hozai comes in, engages Dagon (Grunts) (Blade clatters) (Cocks gun)

Kelvin (to Castiel) Hey, find the girl.

Dagon stabs Hozai: Ah! He bursts to ash

Kelvin: Aah! (Loud clattering, punches landing)

(Castiel coming down basement stair) (Cocks gun)

Kelly: Castiel?

(Dagon drops unconscious Kelvin, runs down basement stair – Castiel and Kelly are gone, Kelly's bed empty. Chains rattle)

Dagon: (Sighs deeply)





(Back at bunker. Dean packing, Sam pacing, trying to call Castiel on cell)

Castiel: This is my voicemail. Make your voice a mail.

(Sam Sighs) (Cellphone beeps)

Dean: Let me guess – no answer.

Sam: I mean, how did Cass even get the Colt out of the safe in the first place?

Dean drops his head. Sam raises an eyebrow

Sam Dean, you – you put the Colt back in the safe, right? Dean?

Dean: It was under my pillow. It – I like to keep it close. (Sighs) He came into my room and he played me.

Sam: Yeah, he played us both.

Dean: Well, I say we find him and we kick his feathered ass.

Sam: Dean, Cass wouldn't have taken the Colt if he wasn't going up against something big.

Dean: Okay, I say we find him, figure out what's going on, and then we kick his feathered ass.



(In Castiel's truck, he and Kelly driving down empty road)

Kelly: Guess you finally caught me. Back there in the basement you came to kill me. (Voice breaks) But you didn't. Thank you.

Castiel: Please don't thank me. I had a mission and I failed.

Kelly: And now?

Castiel: Now, I don't know. I'm just trying to put as much distance between you and Dagon as I can.



(Back at Dagon's hideout)

Dagon, talking to 'empty room': Everything's fine. Just put the container down for a nap.

Lucifer: Did you? Dagon (Singsongy) I know you're lying to me. What happened?

Dagon: My Lord, I –

Lucifer: (growls) Tell me.

Dagon: (grunts in pain) Look, I (Sighs) The angels, they found us. (Sighs) One of them took her.

Lucifer: Which one?

Dagon: (Sighs heavily) Castiel.

Lucifer: (Laughing) Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute. So you let the Winchesters' purse dog take my son? (Screams)

Dagon: (kneeling over in pain)(Exhaling sharply) I didn't –

Lucifer: Mm.

Dagon: I will find them.

Lucifer: Yes, you will, or that little fantasy of yours, ruling Heaven and Earth, you, me, baby makes three Dagon: It's not a fantasy. That was your promise to me.

Lucifer: Here's another promise for you – find my boy, or the torments I will visit upon you will be infinite. Promise.

(Dagon backs up in fear)

Lucifer: You make this right, Dagon. Make it right.

Dagon: I will. (turns to see Kelvin tied up at table)



(Castiel pacing outside of truck in a Motel parking lot) (climbs back in truck)

Kelly: What's going on?

Castiel: I was communicating with Joshua. He's an angel. I, um I was getting my orders. I couldn't kill you back there. But now, I will take you to Heaven. Your life will end, and your baby's, too. It'll be swift and painless.

Kelly: No. (Sighs) No, you don't know. What if it doesn't work?

Castiel: No human form can step through that gate and survive. Your souls will ascend to Heaven, and every cell of your beings will return to the universe. I am sorry, Kelly. The son of Lucifer this is a human/archangel hybrid. That power it's beyond comprehension. Your child could bring the universe to its knees.

Kelly: Or lift it to its feet. This baby – nothing is born evil.

Castiel: I can't take that chance. None of us can.

(Engine stalling)



(back at Dagon's safe house) (she is slicing on Kelvin)

Kelvin: Aah! Aah! (High-pitched ringing) I don't know.

Dagon: Right. Suicide mission, no contingencies, blah, blah, blah. I believe you. You don't know where Castiel is. But he's an angel, you're an angel. Got a feeling, ya dig deep enough, you can make an excellent guess.

Kelvin: Why would I tell you? You're just Lucifer's desperate, clingy side piece.

Dagon: (Laughs) 'Cause being Lucifer's side piece has its perks.

Kelvin: (Groaning, gasping)

Dagon: Now think. Where's he going? WWCD. What would Castiel do?



(At a motel)

Castiel: You need to keep out of sight until I can get us back on the road.

Kelly: (Sighs) I'm thirsty. I just want

Castiel: Just – sit.

Kelly: Something happened to me, Castiel.I lost hope. I tried – I killed myself. I slit my wrists. I died.

And then (Sighs) He saved me. He brought me back to life.

Castiel: Well, that was the pulse. We felt that in Heaven.

Kelly: His power his soul surged through me, and it was good. Pure. I feel I know he is good.

Castiel: Kelly, what your child did, that's a testament to his power, but it's not proof of some goodness.

He needs you alive.

Kelly: Maybe. Or maybe it was a miracle. Maybe – maybe everything that I've been through, everything that I still have to go through, is happening for a reason. Maybe it's part of some plan.

Castiel: No, it isn't. I used to believe in a plan. I used to believe that I had some mission. But I have been through enough now to know that everyone is just winging it. Some of us quite badly. Lucifer, he's just breaking toys. He's sowing destruction and chaos, and there is no grand purpose at work. And there's no special role for you. When Lucifer took over Rooney's body, I'm sorry. You were just there.

Kelly: (Sighs deeply) I know my baby can be good for this world.

Castiel: Kelly, if he's born that is not something you can survive. So even if you are right, and even if the worst isn't inevitable, then who will care for him when you're gone? (Sighs) Who? Who is strong enough to protect him and to keep him from evil influences and to keep him on the righteous path?

Kelly: (Grunts)

Castiel: What?

Kelly: He just – he just kicked. Do you want to ...?

Castiel: Oh, no.

Kelly: It's not a big deal, Castiel. He does it, like, 20 times a day.

(Cas puts his hand on Kelly's belly. Her eyes flash – she gets a vision, a flashback of when Castiel jumped in front of her to protect her)

Castiel: You stay away from her.

Kelly: (Gasps) Kelly?



(Knock on door) (Castiel directs Kelly to the bathroom, door opens. It's Dean)

Dean: Yeah, that's mine.(takes the COLT)

Dean: What the hell are you thinking, huh? –

Sam: Dean? – (sees Kelly in bathroom doorway)

Dean: What?!

Sam: Dean!

Dean Kelly? –

Kelly: Hey.

Sam: Hey.

Castiel: How did you find us?

Dean: Well, while you were scamming me for the Colt, Sam put a tracking app on your phone.

Sam: Cass, when you came back, you didn't even look us in the eye. You wanna explain what's going on here?

Castiel: Yeah. I found Dagon.

Sam: And?

Dean: Did you kill her?

Castiel: No. She's difficult to kill, okay?

Dean: Yeah. You think?

Sam: All right, so what are you doing here, then?

Castiel: I (Sighs) My truck broke down.

Sam: Then – Then why didn't you call us? Cass, we could've helped you.

Castiel; I know. I wanted to keep you out of this. I-I was trying to keep you safe.

Dean: You're not our babysitter, Cass, okay? That is not your job. And when in our whole lives have we ever been safe?

Castiel: This is my responsibility because it is my plan.

Dean: Your plan?

Kelly: He's taking me to Heaven.

Dean: You – You're taking her to the sandbox?

Castiel: Yes. I'm ending this, once and for all. Kelly and her baby have to die.

Sam: No, they don't. Listen, we found another way.

Dean: And you would know that if you would answer your phone.

Castiel: Wait, what are you talking about?

Sam: What you did with me, with – with Gadreel, remember? The – the grace extraction. We take the grace from the baby, from the Nephilim, and then the baby just becomes –

Castiel: Human.

Sam: Human.

Castiel: Wait a minute. That extraction, it nearly killed you.

Sam: Yeah, but it didn't.

Castiel: Because we didn't finish it. We don't even know if this would work.

Dean: There are kinks, yes, but it's a plan. And it beats the hell out of certain death. Am I right?

Kelly: No.

Sam: Hey, Kelly. Kelly. Hey, wait, wait. Wait a second, look. We – we can't imagine what you've been through, okay? But we promised we'd find another way, and we did. We found a better way. This can work.

Kelly: I'm going with Castiel.

Sam: No, Kelly, if you go with Cass, you die. Your baby dies.

Kelly: I go with you, you take away the thing that makes him special.

Sam: How does that matter if you're both dead?

Kelly: That's the only thing that matters.

Dean: Okay, this girl has lost her mind.

Castiel: Hey, Dean.

Sam: Meanwhile, can we take this conversation elsewhere, guys? We're kind of sitting ducks out here.

Dean; Sam's right. Dagon is after Kelly. Your truck is broke down. Why don't we get in the Impala, we'll head back to the bunker, and we'll talk? We'll figure it out.

Sam: Right.

Castiel: Okay, we'll talk.

Dean: Great.

Sam: Great.

Dean: It's like herding cats.

Sam: Yeah. Okay, so what? We – we go back to the bunker and we just try to convince them to stay there forever?

Castiel: (goes to Impala) Dean! (gestures at door) Locked!

(Dean tosses Castiel keys)

(Door creaks)

Kelly: (sits in front seat, exhales sharply) (Sighs)

(Castiel climbs in back, tosses keys onto front seat)

Kely: It's not supposed to happen this way.

Castiel: (Sighs)

(Sam is standing with Dean a few feat from the car, speaking indistinctly)

Kelly looks to boys, looks to keys, starts to slide across seat

Castiel: Kelly.

(She turns ignition, Engine starts)

Castiel: What are you doing!? (Tires peal)

(Kelly drives Impala past the boys)

Dean: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Sam: Hey! Hey! Hey! Whoa! (Tires squeal)

Castiel: Turn around. Where are you going?

Kelly: To Heaven. The sandbox, if you tell me how to get there.

Castiel: Kelly, I can make you stop this car.

Kely: Why haven't you?

Castiel: Okay, why are you doing this?

Kelly: Because he chose you, Castiel. When you put your hand on my stomach, I heard him. He spoke to me. He told me that even if it seems scary, if I just went to the gate, if I just followed your plan, that you would make sure he was born. Sam and Dean, they want to take away his powers because they're scared. (Sighs) But I'm not.

Castiel: Kelly, you –

Kelly: You asked me who would protect him, guide him when I'm gone. I know now. It's you. Me? That's I am not someone that you should put your faith in, Kelly. I couldn't kill Dagon back there. I lost two of my men. I betrayed my friends, my family.

Kelly: Before all this happened, I was a cut-rate political flack in an embarrassingly unprofessional relationship with my boss. I don't know why it's me. And I don't know why it's you. But I know that we are destined for something here. Something great.

Castiel: Well, I wish I had your faith.

Kelly: You will.



(Dean working on Castiel's truck) (Dog barking in distance)

Sam: How did this happen? Dean: (Scoffs) What? The lying? The Heaven plan? Or the fact that I'm working on this stupid truck?

Sam: No, I mean, what's wrong with Cass?

Dean: Well, he hasn't exactly had a banner year. I mean, think about it. Between Lucifer (Blows air) killing Billie, Ramiel, everything's been blowing up in his face. And he's so desperate for a win right now, he can't even see straight. (gestures to truck) Go ahead and give it a try. (Sam climbs in truck)

(Engine starts, squeals)



(At the sandbox)

Kelly: This is it?

Castiel: This is it. Kelly, are you sure?

Kely: As long as you're here, I know it's gonna be okay. (Sniffles)

(High-pitched ringing – bright light swirls over the sand)

Angel appears: Castiel. Kelly. It's good to see you.

Castiel: Hello, Joshua.

Joshua: I know you must be scared. But don't be.

(Grunts) (Joshua is stabbed by Dagon and explodes)

Kelly: (Gasps)

Dagon: Ugh. Hey, girl. Wow! You two got so close! If I hadn't made it here at the last possible second, uh J. K. Flipped your pal Kelvin ages ago, then smoked him. I've been here for hours.

Castiel: You stay away from her.

Dagon: What, no Colt? Wait. You don't even have it anymore? Hilarious.

(Grunting, fighting with Castiel – Castiel on ground)

Dagon: Look at him, your angelic defender. You really thought he was gonna save you? This sad, fluttering, aimless little moth?

Dagon lifts Castiel above her head

Castiel (Grunts)

Kelly: (Whispers) No.

Dagon choking Castiel

(engine revs in distance, headlights come up. It's the boys in truck)

(Gunshots)

(Sam and Dean approach) (Hammer clicks)

Sam starts to reload gun, Dagon tosses him

Sam; (Groans)

Dean takes aim with COLT, (Cocks gun)

Dagon teleports behind him, grabs Dean's arm (Bone snaps)

Dean: (Grunts)

Dagon: Yeah. Time to take this off the board.

Dean: (Grunts)

Dagon melting COLT: (Sizzling)

Dean No!

Dagon drops pieces (Barrel thuds) Okay. Who wants ice cream?

(Dagon approaches Castiel) (Scoffs) Kid, come on. It's just getting sad.

Castiel: (Labored breathing) Run.

(Kelly takes Castiel by the hand)

Dagon: Aw! Adorbs! (Light surges from Kelly to Castiel) (Crackling)

Sam: -Cass! –

Dean: No!

(Dagon goes to smite Castiel, but he blocks her power)

Dagon: How –?

Castiel: Call it a miracle.

(He grabs her, sets her on fire)

(Sizzles)

Dagon: (Groans) (Screaming)

(The boys get up, approach Castiel)

Sam: Cass? What was that?

Castiel: It was, um It was me. But it was also (he looks to Kelly)

Castiel: You're hurt. (to Dean) (He heals Dean broken arm)

(High-pitched ringing)

Castiel: Thank you for coming to fight for us.

Dean: Are you okay?

Castiel: I am. I've been so lost. I'm not lost anymore. And I know now that this child must be born with all of his power.

Sam: You can't actually mean that.

Castiel: Yes. I do. I have faith. We have to go.

Sam: Hey, Cass, wait a second. Wait, hold on. Just -

Castiel: You have to just trust me.

Dean: No, no, no, wait. Okay, whatever that thing did to you, we're not just gonna let you walk away.

Sam: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

Castiel: Yes, it is.

(Castiel reaches up, touches Sam on forehead

Sam: (Inhales sharply – falls unconscious)

(Castiel turns to Dean)

Dean: Don't. (Inhales sharply) (Castiel knocks him out)

Castiel: I'm sorry. (he turns and walks away, leaving Sam and Dean laying on the sand by the sandbox, knocked out and alone)

(Castiel and Kelly climb into his truck)

Kelly: What did he tell you?

Castiel: He didn't tell me. He showed me. The future.
