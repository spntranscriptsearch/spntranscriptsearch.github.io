NOW
CHAPEL
INT. CHAPEL – NIGHT

There is no visible moment of demarcation between the final moments of 4.22 Lucifer Rising and the first moments after the previouslies of 5.01 Sympathy for the Devil.

DEAN
Come on!

SAM finally lets DEAN pull him away from the sigil. They run, and the doors slam shut. They rattle the doors. Seen from the far side, light bursts through cracks in the door.

A high-pitched noise. SAM turns to look at DEAN, and both look back at the light. They squeeze their eyes shut, SAM holding up a hand to block the light, and cover their ears. They fall to their knees.

The light reaches the very edges of the sigil, then whites out everything.

PLANE
INT. PLANE – NIGHT

A cartoon red DEVIL leans over a large open book.

DEVIL
What the devil is your name?

YOSEMITE SAM
Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Yo-Yosemite Sam.

DEVIL
Yosemite Sam?

The DEVIL flips through the book. The view shifts away from what is apparently the in-flight movie, "Devil's Feud Cake".

DEVIL
Let's see. Ah, here it is. I could use a guy like you.

DEAN and SAM are sitting on a plane, contorted exactly as they were a moment ago in the chapel. They look around, astounded. No one around them seems to have noticed anything.

DEAN
What the hell?

SAM
I don't know.

PILOT (over intercom)
Folks, quick word from the flight deck. We're just passing over Ilchester, then Ellicott City, on our initial descent into Baltimore—

DEAN
Ilchester? Weren't we just there?

INT. COCKPIT – NIGHT

PILOT
So if you'd like to stretch your legs, now would be a good time to—

The ordinary bird's-eye view of Maryland at night is interrupted by a column of light shooting into the sky.

PILOT
Holy crap!

The shock wave knocks the plane off kilter. People are thrown around the plane, screaming. Oxygen masks drop down. SAM and DEAN put theirs on as the white light outside grows blinding. The high-pitched noise is back. DEAN looks out the window, terrified.

ACT ONE
CAR
INT. CAR – NIGHT

SAM and DEAN drive in a rented car.

RADIO ANNOUNCER 1
—and Governor O'Malley urged calm—

"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL"

RADIO ANNOUNCER 1
—saying it's very unlikely an abandoned convent would be a target for terrorists, either foreign or homegrown.

DEAN
Change the station.

SAM pokes a button on the digital radio.

RADIO ANNOUNCER 2
—Hurricane Kinley, unexpectedly slamming into the Galveston area—

RADIO ANNOUNCER 3
—announced a successful test of the North Korean nuclear—

RADIO ANNOUNCER 4
—a series of tremors—

RADIO ANNOUNCER 5
—swine flu—

The radio shuts off. SAM sighs. Silence.

SAM
Dean, look—

DEAN
Don't say anything.

A pause.

DEAN
It's okay. We just got to keep our heads down and hash this out, all right?

A pause.

SAM
Yeah, okay.

DEAN
All right, well, first things first—How did we end up on Soul Plane?

SAM
Angels, maybe? I mean, you know, beaming us out of harm's way?

DEAN
Well, whatever. It's the least of our worries. We need to find Cas.

CHUCK'S HOUSE
INT. CHUCK'S HOUSE – DAY

SAM and DEAN walk through the devastated house. A noise, and they both turn: nothing. They keep looking around.

CHUCK jumps out and hits SAM on the head with a toilet plunger. SAM stumbles back, hand to his head.

SAM
Geez! Ow!

CHUCK
Sam.

SAM
Yeah!

DEAN
Hey, Chuck.

CHUCK
So...you're okay?

SAM
Well, my head hurts.

CHUCK
No, I mean—I mean, my—My last vision.

KURT FULLER

CHUCK
You went, like, full-on Vader.

ROB BENEDICT

CHUCK
Your body temperature was one-fifty. Your heart rate was two hundred. Your eyes were black.

DEAN
Your eyes went black?

SAM looks back over his shoulder.

SAM
I didn't know.

DEAN
Where's Cas?

MARK PELLEGRINO

CHUCK
He's dead. Or gone. The archangel smote the crap out of him. I'm sorry.

DEAN
You're sure? I mean, maybe he just vanished into the light or something.

BELLAMY YOUNG

CHUCK
Oh, no. He, like, exploded.

RACHEL MINER

CHUCK
Like a water balloon of chunky soup.

SAM takes a closer look at CHUCK and waves a hand at his own left ear.

SAM
You got a—

CHUCK waves a hand at his own right ear.

CHUCK
Uh...right here?

SAM indicates the other side of CHUCK's head.

SAM
Uh, the...

CHUCK feels at his hair.

CHUCK
Oh. Oh, god.

CHUCK pulls something out.

CHUCK
Is that a molar?

It is.

CHUCK
Do I have a molar in my hair? This has been a really stressful day.

DEAN
Cas, you stupid bastard.

SAM
Stupid? He was trying to help us.

DEAN
Yeah, exactly.

SAM
So, what now?

DEAN
I don't know.

CHUCK
Oh, crap.

SAM
What?

CHUCK
I can feel them.

ZACHARIAH
Thought we'd find you here.

SAM and DEAN turn around: ZACHARIAH is there, two ANGELS accompanying him.

ZACHARIAH
Playtime's over, Dean. Time to come with us.

DEAN points at ZACHARIAH.

DEAN
You just keep your distance, asshat.

ZACHARIAH
Right, Sammy?

ZACHARIAH winks.

ZACHARIAH
You had a chance to stop your brother, and you couldn't. So let's not quibble over who started what. Let's just say it was—

ZACHARIAH
Lucifer is powerful in ways that defy description. We need to strike now, hard and fast—before he finds his vessel.

SAM
His vessel? Lucifer needs a meat suit?

DEAN
After what you did, I don't want jack squat from you!

ZACHARIAH
You listen to me, boy! You think you can rebel against us? As Lucifer did?

Blood drips from DEAN's hand.

ZACHARIAH
You're bleeding.

DEAN
Oh, yeah—a little insurance policy in case you dicks showed up.

DEAN slaps his bloody hand on an Angel Banishing Sigil drawn behind a door.

ZACHARIAH
No!

SAM and CHUCK flinch. ZACHARIAH vanishes in white light. When DEAN looks, the other ANGELS are gone as well.

DEAN
Learned that from my friend Cas, you son of a bitch.

CHUCK
This sucks ass.

MOTEL
EXT. REGENT INN MOTEL – DAY

SAM rushes down a staircase past a couple making out and enters the motel.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

DEAN loads a gun. SAM enters the room.

DEAN
Hey.

SAM
Hey.

SAM closes the door, pulls something out of his shirt, and tosses it to DEAN. DEAN catches it and examines it.

SAM
Here. Hex bags. No way the angels will find us with those. Demons, either, for that matter.

DEAN
Where'd you get it?

SAM
I made it.

DEAN
How?

SAM hesitates long enough for DEAN to look up at him.

SAM
I...I learned it from Ruby.

DEAN puts the gun down and approaches SAM.

DEAN
Speaking of. How you doing? Are you jonesing for another hit of bitch blood or what?

SAM
I-it's weird. Uh, tell you the truth, I'm fine. No shakes, no fever. It's like whoever...put me on that plane cleaned me right up.

DEAN
Supernatural methadone.

SAM
Yeah, I guess.

SAM pauses.

SAM
Dean—

DEAN
Sam.

DEAN turns away.

DEAN
It's okay. You don't have to say anything.

SAM
Well, that's good. Because what can I even say? "I'm sorry"? "I screwed up"? Doesn't really do it justice, you know? Look, there's nothing I can do or say that will ever make this right—

DEAN
So why do you keep bringing it up?!

SAM sighs. DEAN turns back to him.

DEAN
Look, all I'm saying is, why do we have to put this under a microscope? We made a mess. We clean it up. That's it.

SAM nods.

DEAN
All right, so, say this is just any other hunt. You know? What do we do first?

SAM
We'd, uh, figure out where the thing is.

DEAN
All right. So we just got to find...the devil.

NICK'S HOUSE
EXT. NICK'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Pike Creek, Delaware

A MAN (his name is NICK) walks along the sidewalk to his house. He opens his front gate, which creaks, and lets it swing shut behind him. A wind picks up, swinging the gate forward and back, and NICK turns back to look. The gate bangs open and shut.

INT. NICK'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

NICK lies in bed, alone and restless. He pulls his hands out from under the blankets: they're bloodstained. He tosses the blankets back and there's blood all over him and the sheets, a lot of it, as though someone bled to death a moment ago. NICK gets out of bed and switches on the bedside light. There's no blood.

NICK
All right, keep it together. Keep it together, man.

NICK turns off the light and lies down. He rolls over and there's a WOMAN in bed next to him, blood on her cheek. He sits up, shocked: he knows her—her name is SARAH—and the last thing he expected was to see her.

SARAH
It's you, Nick. You're special. You're chosen.

NICK shakes his head, disbelieving, and covers his eyes with one hand. When he looks back, SARAH is gone.

ACT TWO
BECKY'S ROOM
INT. BEDROOM – DAY

A WOMAN named BECKY, whose bedroom walls have poster-size prints of the covers of Carver Edlund's Supernatural: Route 666 and Supernatural: The Benders, sits at her computer, typing and reading aloud.

BECKY
"And then Sam touched—" No. "—caressed Dean's clavicle. 'This is wrong,' said Dean. 'Then I don't want to be right,' replied Sam, in a husky voice."

A message appears on her screen: CARVER EDLUND CALLING

BECKY frowns and clicks Accept. The window expands to a videophone: it's CHUCK. He glances over his shoulder and back. BECKY covers her mouth, excited enough that it causes her difficulty speaking.

BECKY
Oh...my...god. You. You're...

CHUCK
Carver Edlund, yeah. Hi, Becky.

BECKY
You got my letters. And my marzipan.

CHUCK can't quite meet her eyes.

CHUCK
Yeah, yeah. Um...yummy. But, uh—

BECKY
I am your number-one fan. You know, I'm samlicker81.

CHUCK
I'm sorry. You're—You're what?

BECKY
Webmistress at morethanbrothers dot net?

CHUCK
Oh. Yeah. No, yeah. You're my...number-one fan.

BECKY grins.

CHUCK
That's why I contacted you. You're the only one who will believe me.

CHUCK looks heavenward. BECKY frowns, concerned.

BECKY
Are you all right?

CHUCK
No. I'm being watched. Okay, not, not now—at least, I don't think so. But I don't have much time. I need your help.

BECKY switches back to overexcited.

BECKY
You need my help?

CHUCK
That's right. I need you to get a message to Sam and Dean. Okay?

BECKY sighs, reality intruding.

BECKY
Look, Mr. Edlund... Yes, I'm a fan, but I really don't appreciate being mocked. I know that Supernatural's just a book, okay? I know the difference between fantasy and reality.

CHUCK
Becky, it's all real.

BECKY snaps back to overexcitedness.

BECKY
I knew it!

MOTEL
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

SAM stares at John's journal. DEAN is watching TV.

VOICE 1
How would you then explain an earthquake, a hurricane, and multiple tornadoes, all at the same time, all around the globe?

VOICE 2
Two words. Carbon emissions.

DEAN (to environmentalist on TV)
Yeah, right, wavy gravy.

There is a knock at the door. DEAN pulls his gun. SAM answers. It's BECKY, so excited she's having trouble breathing.

SAM
You okay, lady?

BECKY
Sam...is it really you?

SAM glances back at DEAN. BECKY steps closer and puts a hand on SAM's chest.

BECKY
And you're so firm.

SAM
Uh, do I know you?

BECKY pulls back. SAM continues to stare, bewildered.

BECKY
No. But I know you. You're Sam Winchester. And you're—

BECKY looks at DEAN, who's staring at her, his gun hand out of sight.

BECKY
—not what I pictured. I'm Becky.

BECKY pushes past SAM into the room.

BECKY
I read all about you guys. And I've even written a few—

BECKY glances down, giggling a little.

BECKY
Anyway, Mr. Edlund told me where you were.

DEAN stands up.

DEAN
Chuck?

SAM closes the door.

BECKY
He's got a message, but he's being watched. Angels. Nice change-up to the mythology, by the way. The demon stuff was getting kind of old.

SAM
Right. Just, um...what's the message?

BECKY
He had a vision. "The Michael sword is on earth. The angels lost it."

DEAN
The Michael sword?

SAM
Becky, does he know where it is?

BECKY
In a castle, on a hill made of forty-two dogs.

DEAN
Forty-two dogs?

SAM
Are...you sure you got that right?

BECKY
It doesn't make sense, but that's what he said.

BECKY steps closer to SAM.

BECKY
I memorized every word.

BECKY touches SAM's chest.

BECKY
For you.

SAM glances over at DEAN and down at BECKY: awkward.

SAM
Um, Becky, c—uh, can you...quit touching me?

BECKY
No.

MOTEL, LATER
EXT. REGENT INN MOTEL – DAY

BOBBY arrives in the Impala.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

A knock on the door. DEAN opens it. It's BOBBY.

DEAN
Hey, Bobby.

BOBBY hugs DEAN, slapping him on the back.

BOBBY
Good to see you boys all in one piece.

BOBBY hugs SAM, who's grinning. DEAN closes the door.

DEAN
You weren't followed, were you?

BOBBY
You mean by angels, demons, or Sam's new superfan?

SAM laughs.

SAM
You heard.

BOBBY
I heard, Romeo. So...sword of Michael, huh?

DEAN
You think we're talking about the actual sword from the actual archangel?

BOBBY
You better friggin' hope so.

BOBBY opens a book to a painting of Michael surrounded by other angels. In this painting, Michael looks like a winged woman and the other angels like naked babies with wings.

BOBBY
That's Michael. Toughest son of a bitch they got.

SAM flips to another painting. Again, Michael has a feminine face.

DEAN
You kidding me? Tough? That guy looks like Cate Blanchett.

BOBBY
Well, I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley, believe me. He commands the heavenly host. During the last big dust-up upstairs, he's the one who booted Lucifer's ass to the basement. Did it with that sword.

BOBBY points to the sword in the painted Michael's hand.

BOBBY
So if we can find it...

SAM
We can kick the devil's ass all over again. All right. So, where do we start?

BOBBY
Divvy up and start reading—try and make sense of Chuck's nonsense.

SAM gets up and heads for a pile of old books, presumably brought by BOBBY. He stares at the books for a long moment, not reaching for them.

BOBBY
Kid? You all right?

SAM turns to face BOBBY.

SAM
No, actually. Bobby, this is all my fault. I'm sorry.

DEAN
Sam...

SAM
Lilith did not break the final seal. Lilith was the final seal.

DEAN
Sam, stop it.

SAM
I killed her, and I set Lucifer free.

BOBBY
You what?

SAM
You guys warned me about Ruby, the demon blood, but I didn't listen. I brought this on.

DEAN says nothing. BOBBY stands up and walks closer.

BOBBY
You're damn right you didn't listen. You were reckless and selfish and arrogant.

SAM
I'm sorry.

BOBBY
Oh, yeah? You're sorry you started Armageddon? This kind of thing don't get forgiven, boy. If, by some miracle, we pull this off...I want you to lose my number. You understand me?

SAM nods. His expression barely changes: this can't be much different from what he expected. DEAN doesn't protest.

SAM
There's an old church nearby. Maybe I'll go read some of the lore books there.

BOBBY
Yeah. You do that.

SAM leaves. BOBBY turns back to DEAN, who stays silent.

EXT. REGENT INN MOTEL – DAY

SAM walks along the street.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT?

BOBBY and DEAN sit doing research.

BOBBY
I never would have guessed that your daddy was right.

DEAN
About what?

BOBBY
About your brother.

DEAN looks up.

BOBBY
What John said—you save Sam or kill him. Maybe...

DEAN
Maybe what?

BOBBY
Maybe we shouldn't have tried so hard to save him.

DEAN
Bobby.

BOBBY
He ended the world, Dean. And you and I weren't strong enough to stop him proper. That's on us. I'm just saying, your dad was right.

DEAN
Dad.

DEAN rummages through his bag. He pulls out a plastic Ziplock full of cards.

DEAN
It's got to be in here somewhere.

BOBBY
What the hell are you talking about?

DEAN
Here.

DEAN pulls one out and reads it. BOBBY stands up. DEAN comes over.

DEAN
I don't believe it.

BOBBY
What the hell is it?

DEAN
It's a card for my dad's lockup in upstate New York. Read it.

BOBBY takes the card.

BOBBY
"Castle Storage. 42 Rover Hill."

DEAN
Castle on a hill of forty-two dogs.

DEAN takes the card back.

BOBBY
So you think your dad had the Michael sword all this time?

DEAN
I don't know. I'm not sure what else Chuck could have meant.

BOBBY
Yeah. Okay. It's good enough for me.

BOBBY attacks DEAN, knocking him through the barrier between the kitchenette and the beds. BOBBY yanks DEAN up and slams him down again. BOBBY's eyes go black.

ACT THREE
MOTEL
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT?

'BOBBY' grabs DEAN by the throat and drags him to his feet. A FEMALE DEMON enters, a MALE DEMON behind her.

FEMALE DEMON
I always knew you were a big, dumb, slow, dim pain in the ass, Dean. But I never dreamed you were so V.I.P.

The FEMALE DEMON sees Ruby's knife on the table and picks it up.

FEMALE DEMON
I mean, you're gonna ice the devil? You? If I'd have known that, I'd have ripped your pretty, pretty face off ages ago.

DEAN
Ruby.

FEMALE DEMON
Try again. Go back further.

DEAN
Meg?

MEG
Hi. These are the days of miracle and wonder, Dean. Our father's among us. You know we're all dreaming again for the first time since we were human? It's heaven on earth. Or hell. We really owe your brother a fruit basket.

DEAN
My god, you like the sound of your own voice.

MEG
But you, on the other hand, you're the only bump in the road. So every demon—every single one—is just dying for a piece of you.

DEAN smirks.

DEAN
Get in line.

MEG
Oh, I'm in the front of the line, baby. Let's ride.

MEG kisses DEAN.

DEAN
What is that, peanut butter?

MEG
You know, your surrogate daddy's still awake screaming in there. And I want him to know how it feels slicing the life out of you.

MEG hands the knife to 'BOBBY', who raises it to DEAN's throat. DEAN struggles.

DEAN
Bobby!

'BOBBY' looks back at MEG.

MEG
Now!

'BOBBY' raises the knife to stab DEAN.

DEAN
Bobby! No!

The black fades from 'BOBBY's eyes. The knife comes down and BOBBY flashes gold as the demon 'BOBBY' dies: BOBBY stabbed himself. BOBBY collapses.

DEAN rushes MEG and the MALE DEMON. The MALE DEMON slams DEAN into the wall, then the floor. SAM enters and sees BOBBY on the floor bleeding and DEAN getting beaten.

SAM
No!

MEG
Heya, Sammy. You miss me? 'Cause I sure missed you.

SAM
Meg?

MEG grins. SAM swings and misses. MEG kicks him in the crotch and knocks him to the ground while the MALE DEMON pounds DEAN.

MEG
It's not so easy without those super-special demon powers, huh, Sammy?

The MALE DEMON kicks DEAN. MEG punches SAM. DEAN kicks the feet out from under the MALE DEMON, grabs the knife out of BOBBY's stomach and stabs the MALE DEMON in the chest. DEAN stands up. MEG backs away. DEAN advances. MEG screams and smokes out of the WOMAN, who collapses. DEAN lowers the knife.

NICK'S HOUSE
INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Pike Creek, Delaware

NICK carries a blanket and teddy bears past a freestanding baby rocker to a cardboard box. The rocker starts moving on its own. NICK turns to look, then goes over and stops it.

A baby's cry. NICK digs frantically through the box and pulls out a baby monitor. He stares at it, listening to the crying.

INT. NURSERY – NIGHT

NICK opens the door, still listening. He stares at the crib for a moment. The crying goes silent. He turns on the light. Silence. He turns away and the crying begins again. He turns back and sees blood pouring out of the crib onto the carpet.

NICK
No...

NICK goes up to the crib and falls to his knees, sobbing.

The crib is empty. It and the carpet are clean.

EMERGENCY ROOM
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM burst into a hospital emergency room, carrying BOBBY.

DEAN
Need some help here!

NURSE
What happened?

SAM
He was stabbed.

NURSE
Can we get a gurney?

Two NURSES rush a gurney over to BOBBY.

DEAN
Hang on, Bobby. Hang in there. You're gonna be okay.

They get BOBBY onto the gurney and rush him off. SAM and DEAN follow. The NURSE stops them.

NURSE
Just wait here.

SAM
We can't just leave him.

NURSE
Just don't move. I've got questions.

The NURSE leaves.

DEAN
Sammy, we got to go.

SAM
No. No way, Dean.

DEAN
The demons heard where the sword is. We got to get to it before they do, if we're not too late already. Come on!

DEAN leaves. SAM follows.

JOHN'S LOCKUP
EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

The Impala rushes along.

EXT. CASTLE STORAGE – NIGHT

DEAN opens the trunk. He and SAM load guns and close the trunk. DEAN unlocks the storage room, SAM standing watch.

INT. JOHN'S LOCKUP – NIGHT

SAM and DEAN enter the room, shotguns ready. They find dead demons sprawled across the floor.

ZACHARIAH
I see you told the demons where the sword is.

DEAN and SAM turn. ZACHARIAH is there with two ANGELS escorting.

DEAN
Oh, thank god. The angels are here.

ZACHARIAH
And to think...they could have grabbed it any time they wanted.

ZACHARIAH waves a hand to close the door.

ZACHARIAH
It was right in front of them.

SAM
What do you mean?

ZACHARIAH
We may have planted that particular piece of prophecy inside Chuck's skull, but it happened to be true. We did lose the Michael sword. We truly couldn't find it. Until now. You've just hand-delivered it to us.

DEAN
We don't have anything.

ZACHARIAH
It's you, chucklehead. You're the Michael sword.

DEAN stares.

ACT FOUR
JOHN'S LOCKUP
INT. JOHN'S LOCKUP – NIGHT

ZACHARIAH continues to address DEAN.

ZACHARIAH
What, you thought you could actually kill Lucifer? You simpering wad of insecurity and self-loathing? No. You're just a human, Dean. And not much of one.

DEAN
What do you mean, I'm the sword?

ZACHARIAH
You're Michael's weapon. Or, rather, his...receptacle.

DEAN
I'm a vessel?

ZACHARIAH
You're the vessel. Michael's vessel.

DEAN
How? Why—why me?

ZACHARIAH
Because you're chosen! It's a great honor, Dean.

DEAN
Oh, yeah. Yeah, life as an angel condom. That's real fun. I think I'll pass, thanks.

ZACHARIAH
Joking. Always joking. Well...no more jokes.

ZACHARIAH raises one hand, fingers like a gun, and points at DEAN, then shifts to SAM.

ZACHARIAH
Bang.

A loud crunch. SAM falls, unable to stand.

SAM
God!

DEAN
You son of a bitch!

ZACHARIAH
Keep mouthing off, I'll break more than his legs. I am completely and utterly through screwing around. The war has begun. We don't have our general. That's bad. Now, Michael is going to take his vessel and lead the final charge against the adversary. You understand me?

DEAN
How many humans die in the crossfire, huh? A million? Five, ten?

ZACHARIAH
Probably more. If Lucifer goes unchecked, you know how many die? All of them. He'll roast the planet alive.

DEAN
There's a reason you're telling me this instead of just nabbing me. You need my consent. Michael needs my say-so to ride around in my skin.

ZACHARIAH
Unfortunately, yes.

DEAN
Well, there's got to be another way.

ZACHARIAH
There is no other way. There must be a battle. Michael must defeat the serpent. It is written.

DEAN
Yeah, maybe. But, on the other hand... Eat me. The answer's no.

ZACHARIAH
Okay. How about this? Your friend Bobby—we know he's gravely injured. Say yes, and we'll heal him. Say no, he'll never walk again.

SAM glances up at DEAN.

DEAN
No.

ZACHARIAH
Then how about we heal you from...stage-four stomach cancer?

DEAN doubles over, coughing. He spits into his palm: blood.

DEAN
No.

ZACHARIAH
Then let's get really creative. Uh, let's see how...Sam does without his lungs.

DEAN turns to look at SAM, who gasps for breath.

ZACHARIAH
Are we having fun yet? You're going to say yes, Dean.

DEAN
Just kill us.

ZACHARIAH
Kill you? Oh, no. I'm just getting started.

Bright light flashes. ZACHARIAH turns. One of the ANGELS collapses, a bloody hole in his throat. CASTIEL stands beside him. The other ANGEL fights CASTIEL. DEAN and ZACHARIAH stare; SAM tries to take a breath. CASTIEL and the ANGEL slam each other around. CASTIEL stabs the other angel in the back. Bright light flashes. ZACHARIAH stares. CASTIEL walks closer. In the background, SAM is still and silent.

ZACHARIAH
How are you...

CASTIEL
Alive? That's a good question. How did these two end up on that airplane? Another good question. 'Cause the angels didn't do it. I think we both know the answer, don't we?

ZACHARIAH
No. That's not possible.

CASTIEL
It scares you. Well, it should. Now, put these boys back together and go. I won't ask twice.

ZACHARIAH vanishes. SAM looks up and around, surprised. DEAN and SAM stand up.

CASTIEL
You two need to be more careful.

DEAN
Yeah, I'm starting to get that. Your frat brothers are bigger dicks than I thought.

CASTIEL
I don't mean the angels. Lucifer is circling his vessel. And once he takes it, those hex bags won't be enough to protect you.

CASTIEL puts one hand on DEAN's chest, the other on SAM's. DEAN and SAM gasp.

DEAN
What the hell was that?

CASTIEL
An Enochian sigil. It'll hide you from every angel in creation, including Lucifer.

DEAN
What, did you just brand us with it?

CASTIEL
No. I carved it into your ribs.

A pause.

SAM
Hey, Cas, were you really dead?

CASTIEL
Yes.

DEAN
Then how are you back?

CASTIEL vanishes. SAM and DEAN are alone with the dead.

NICK'S HOUSE
INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT

NICK lies in bed in an empty room.

SARAH
Nick.

NICK sits up. SARAH stands at the foot of the bed.

SARAH
Nick. You're dreaming, Nick. But it doesn't mean this isn't real.

NICK
Sarah?

SARAH
I'm not your wife, Nick. I'm an angel.

NICK
An angel?

SARAH
My name is Lucifer.

NICK
Sure. Naturally. Um... Could you do me a favor there, Satan, and remind me to quit drinking before I go to bed?

LUCIFER
I'm here because you're special, Nick. There's very, very few people like you.

NICK
Is that so?

LUCIFER
You're a vessel—a very powerful vessel.

NICK swings his legs off the bed.

NICK
Meaning what, exactly?

LUCIFER
I need to take control of your mind and your body. To be honest, it'll probably be unpleasant for you. But it is necessary.

NICK
Okay, look...if it's just the same to you, I think I'd like to wake up now.

LUCIFER
I told you—this is real. Don't be afraid. This is your choice.

LUCIFER sits on the bed next to NICK.

LUCIFER
You need to invite me in.

NICK
Even if this is real—which it's not, but assuming it was...why the hell would I do something like that?

LUCIFER
You people misunderstand me. You call me "Satan" and "devil", but... Do you know my crime? I loved God too much. And for that, he betrayed me—punished me. Just as he's punished you. After all, how could God stand idly by while that man broke into your home and butchered your family in their beds?

NICK swallows, not looking at her.

LUCIFER
There are only two rational answers, Nick—either he's sadistic, or he simply doesn't care. You're angry. You have every right to be angry. I am angry, too. That's why I want to find him—hold him accountable for his actions. Just because he created us doesn't mean he can toy with us, like playthings.

NICK
If I help you...can you bring back my family?

LUCIFER
I'm sorry. I can't. But I can give you the next best thing. God did this to you, Nick. And I can give you justice. Peace.

NICK
How do I know you're telling the truth?

LUCIFER
Because, contrary to popular belief, I don't lie. I don't need to. What I need...is you. Nick, I need you to say yes.

NICK remembers the empty baby rocker, the blood pouring from the crib, the empty crib.

NICK
Then yes.

EXT. NICK'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The high-pitched screech of angel speech. White light flares from all the upper windows of NICK's house.

EPILOGUE
INT. HOSPITAL – NIGHT

A NURSE walks down a hospital corridor past a PATIENT with a mobile IV stand. Both pass a closed door, behind which BOBBY is heard yelling.

BOBBY
"Unlikely to walk again"?! Why, you snot-nosed son of a bitch! Wait till I get out of this bed!

The door bursts open and a DOCTOR flees. Inside, BOBBY sits in a hospital bed and SAM and DEAN stand by the window.

BOBBY
I'll use my game leg and kick your friggin' ass! Yeah, you better run!

BOBBY looks over at SAM and DEAN.

BOBBY
You believe that yahoo?

DEAN
Screw him. You'll be fine.

SAM
So, let me ask the million-dollar question. What do we do now?

BOBBY
Well... We save as many as we can for as long as we can, I guess. It's bad. Whoever wins, heaven or hell, we're boned.

DEAN
What if we win?

BOBBY stares at him. SAM turns to face DEAN, who sounds a bit too confident.

DEAN
I'm serious. I mean, screw the angels and the demons and their crap apocalypse. Hell, they want to fight a war, they can find their own planet. This one's ours, and I say they get the hell off it. We take 'em all on. We kill the devil. Hell, we even kill Michael if we have to. But we do it our own damn selves.

BOBBY
And how are we supposed to do all this, genius?

DEAN
I got no idea. But what I do have is a GED and a give-'em-hell attitude, and I'll figure it out.

BOBBY
You are nine kinds of crazy, boy.

DEAN
It's been said.

DEAN pats BOBBY on the shoulder.

DEAN
Listen, you stay on the mend. We'll see you in a bit.

DEAN heads for the door. SAM follows.

BOBBY
Sam?

SAM stops.

BOBBY
I was awake. I know what I said back there. I just want you to know that...that was the demon talking. I ain't cutting you out, boy. Not ever.

A long pause. SAM sighs.

SAM
Thanks, Bobby.

BOBBY
You're welcome. I deserve a damn medal for this, but...you're welcome.

DEAN and SAM leave.

EXT. PARKING LOT – NIGHT

An ambulance drives past. SAM and DEAN walk out to the cars.

SAM
You know, I was thinking, Dean—maybe we could go after the Colt.

DEAN
Why? What difference would that make?

SAM
Well, we could use it on Lucifer. I mean, you just said back there—

DEAN
I just said a bunch of crap for Bobby's benefit.

DEAN stops in the middle of the road. SAM stops, looking at him.

DEAN
I mean, I'll fight. I'll fight till the last man, but let's at least be honest. I mean, we don't stand a snowball's chance, and you know that. I mean, hell, you of all people know that.

DEAN goes around SAM.

SAM
Dean...

DEAN stops and turns back.

SAM
Is there something you want to say to me?

A long pause.

DEAN
I tried, Sammy. I mean, I really tried. But I just can't keep pretending that everything's all right. Because it's not. And it's never going to be. You chose a demon over your own brother—

SAM rolls his eyes.

DEAN
—and look what happened.

SAM
I would give anything—anything—to take it all back.

DEAN
I know you would. And I know how sorry you are. I do. But, man...you were the one that I depended on the most. And you let me down in ways that I can't even...

DEAN pauses, struggling for words.

DEAN
I'm just—I'm having a hard time forgiving and forgetting here. You know?

SAM
What can I do?

DEAN
Honestly? Nothing.

SAM nods a little, looking down: this doesn't surprise him.

DEAN
I just don't...I don't think that we can ever be what we were. You know?

SAM nods again: this isn't a surprise either.

DEAN
I just don't think I can trust you.

SAM looks up: this he wasn't expecting. DEAN shakes his head and walks away, pausing at the trunk of the Impala to look back, then gets into the driver's seat.
