TEASER
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

(Sam is running from cops. There are sirens and a police car comes around the corner. Sam runs to a door and tries to open it but it's locked. He kicks a gate open and hides behind a wall as the police car passes. The car drives slowly past a "Castle Storage" sign - John Winchester's lock-up, which Sam doesn't notice. When it's gone, he walks quickly to a door labelled "Delivery Entrance Only". He enters and closes the door behind him.


INT. BAR - NIGHT

(Sam enters the bar. A young woman, Robin, is cleaning the bar.)

ROBIN: Hey, we're closed.

SAM: Just uh, just give me a second. (He goes to the window.)

ROBIN: So pal, we - we open at noon.

SAM: Look, you don't understand.

(Outside, the cop car passes again and Sam moves away from the window.)

ROBIN: Okay, I - I think I understand just fine. Look I - I don't need this kind of hassle. So seriously, just get the hell out.

SAM: Please. Please, just give me a minute to think, that's all. Then I'm out of your hair. (Under the counter, Robin picks up a baseball bat.) One minute. Please. (Sam catches his breath.)

ROBIN: (She sighs and puts the bat down.) What's your name?

SAM: I don't know.

ROBIN: What do you mean you don't know?

SAM: I mean I don't remember. I don't remember anything.

ACT I
(Robin opens a drink and gives it to Sam.)

ROBIN: Come on, you're dickin' with me. Nothing?

SAM: I'm telling you. Blank slate. (He drinks.)

ROBIN: Well, you got a wallet? ID?

SAM: I wish I did.

ROBIN: Okay, well what's the last thing you remember?

SAM: (shakes his head) Um, I woke up on a park bench, cops shoving a flashlight in my face, trying to take me in.

ROBIN: So you ran.

SAM: No, I, um, I knocked 'em out cold. Both of 'em. No, look, I - I didn't mean to. It just happened really fast, you know I - I think instinct or something, I guess.

ROBIN: Some instinct.

SAM: Yeah, tell me about it. I mean, who even knows how to do something like that?

ROBIN: We'll get you to the ER. The - the quacks will hash it out.

SAM: No.

ROBIN: Try "yeah". Look the-the bats have flown the belfry, you need to see a doctor.

SAM: No. (Sam gets up.) I don't have time.

ROBIN: Time for what?

SAM: (sighs) Look, it's hard to explain, I just feel like I - I have to be somewhere. There's something I gotta stop.

ROBIN: Oh, like a wedding? A train?

SAM: No, something important. Something like life or death, like -

ROBIN: Okay, hey, hey, hey. Just relax, you know, you - you can't poop it out, so just... It'll come to you.

(Sam nods. He notices something and walks to a bookshelf. He picks up a book - The Haunter of the Dark by H.P. Lovecraft.)

ROBIN: What is it? (He shows her the title.) You a horror fan?

SAM: Yeah, um, I think so. I really think so. Something - something about this...

(A rush of memories hits Sam.
BOBBY: Phillips ain't his last name. It's Lovecraft.
He sees flashes of Dean outside the hospital, Ben in the car, himself being jumped by a demon, Balthazar, Bobby telling him about H.P. Lovecraft and a hotel called the Nite Owl. The memory-flash ends and Sam, who is slumped over, is gasping but otherwise okay.)

ROBIN: Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Seriously, we are taking you to a doctor.

SAM: Have you got a computer?

ROBIN: What?

(Sam finds the Nite Owl Hotel's website on Robin's laptop.)

SAM: That's it. It exists. Look, two towns over. (He turns the laptop so that she can see.)

ROBIN: What, you think you're staying in this dump?

SAM: Maybe.

ROBIN: Oh, maybe you're a hooker.

SAM: (chuckles) I guess I'll find out.

ROBIN: Hmm.

SAM: (sighs) Look, um, I don't know how to say, uh, thanks for everything.

ROBIN: Where do you think you're going?

SAM: I'll be fine.

ROBIN: Says the headcase that just slumped over a minute ago. Look, is there any way I can convince you to go to a hospital?

SAM: No. Apparently, I'm stubborn.

ROBIN: Oh. So am I. (She gets her jacket.) I'm driving.

SAM: Look, that's really nice of you, but not necessary.

ROBIN: Really? Okay, look, your eggs are scrambled.

SAM: But -

ROBIN: But nothing.

SAM: No, I mean I'm just some guy. I - I could be anybody. You gotta be nuts.

ROBIN: I've been called that. Look, if I let you go off alone, I won't be able to sleep at night. And, honestly, I'm dying to know how it all turns out.


EXT. OUTSIDE NITE OWL HOTEL - NIGHT

(Sam & Robin walk towards the hotel.)

ROBIN: So, uh, where do we start?

SAM: Uh, ground floor corner room, nearest to the fire escape. That's the one I'd pick, quickest getaway.

ROBIN: Any why do you know that?

SAM: (scoffs) I just do.


INT. NITE OWL HOTEL - NIGHT

(Sam & Robin walk past a man that looks like Bobby. They stand outside the door of room 107. Sam knocks on the door. There's no answer. He tries the handle. It's locked.)

SAM: Hey, you got a credit card?

ROBIN: Uh - (She gets her card.) Why, are we uh, checking in?

SAM: Sort of. (He takes the card and picks the lock with it. The door opens. Robin takes her card back.)

ROBIN: Dude... Who are you?

SAM: Good question.

(They enter the room. There are various pictures, newspaper articles and maps on the wall - a typical hunter's investigation.)

ROBIN: This all yours?

SAM: I don't know. I guess.

ROBIN: Well, I love what you've done with the place. It's very Beautiful Mind meets Se7en. Sorry, I talk when I'm nervous. (She picks up an ID from the table.) Hey, well I guess we know your name. Nice to meet you, Jimmy Page. (She leafs through the other fake IDs.) And uh, Neil Peart, and Angus Young. (She chuckles nervously.) Okay, listen no offence but I'm - I'm really starting to freak out.

SAM: (scoffs) You and me both. (He sighs and notices a newspaper article. The headline is "SFU Professor Missing". The picture is of Dr Eleanor Visyak. Sam gets another rush of memories. There is a flash of Dr Visyak. Sam collapses. He remembers something else.)


[ SAM'S MEMORY - EXT. ALLEY - DAY

(Sam, Bobby and Dean are walking down an alley.)

DEAN: Where is she?

BOBBY: (shrugs) She said to meet her here. I'll try her again. (He takes out his cellphone and dials. They hear Eleanor's phone ringing from nearby. It's on the ground next to a dumpster. They hurry to it and find Eleanor sitting on he ground against the dumpster. She's hurt. Bobby kneels in front of her. Sam and Dean stand behind him.)

BOBBY: El?

ELEANOR: Hey. I guess I could've used your help after all.

BOBBY: Just be still.

SAM: What happened?

ELEANOR: They took me. I got away.

(She opens her coat. Her shirt is soaked with blood by her stomach.)

BOBBY: Oh, Ellie. What have they done to you?

ELEANOR: (chuckles) Everything. The demon I could've handled, but when the angel stepped in, I - (sighs) I told him, Bobby. They have enough to crack Purgatory wide open.

BOBBY: Tell me. I need to know.

ELEANOR: They need virgin blood. That's a milk-run for them. And they need the blood of a Purgatory native, and well, they've got plenty of that now.

DEAN: Have they opened it yet?

ELEANOR: (she shakes her head) Tomorrow. The moon - an eclipse. I'm sorry, Bobby.

BOBBY: No, it's okay. It's okay.

ELEANOR: I'm sorry, really sorr-

BOBBY: Tell us where they are.

(Eleanor dies.)

BOBBY: El?

(Bobby closes her eyes. Castiel appears behind Sam and Dean.)

CASTIEL: I'm sorry this had to happen. (Bobby stands up.) Crowley got carried away.

BOBBY: Yeah, I bet it was all Crowley you son of a bitch! (He tries to go after Castiel but Sam and Dean restrain him and he steps back.)

DEAN: (to Castiel) You don't even see it, do you? How totally off the rails you are!

CASTIEL: Enough! I don't care what you think. I've tried to make you understand. You won't listen. So let me make this simple. Please, go home and let me stop Raphael. I won't ask again.

DEAN: Well, good, 'cause I think you already know the answer.

CASTIEL (shakes his head) I wish it hadn't come to this. Well rest assured, when this is all over, I will save Sam, but only if you stand down.

DEAN: Save Sam from what?

(Castiel disappears. He reappears behind Sam and touches Sam's temple. A bright light fills up the screen.) ]


(The memory-flash ends and Sam is in the hotel room, his breathing quick.)

ROBIN: Hey, hey. Are you okay?

SAM: Sam. My name is Sam.

(In the bathroom, Sam leans over the basin and splashes his face with water.)

ROBIN: So, uh, what do you remember?

SAM: Well. (chuckles) It might sound pretty strange if I said it aloud. (He dries his face with a towel.)

ROBIN: Oh, it - it couldn't get any stranger.

SAM: (He throws the towel down.) Yeah. Don't be so sure. (sighs & shrugs) Look, I - I don't know, I mean it's all pretty spotty, you know? I just remember I was, I was with, uh - with two guys. One was a - like a male model type and the other was an older guy named, uh, Bobby. (He picks up an address book and leafs through it.)

ROBIN: Okay. W- What are you looking for?

SAM: Here. Bobby Singer. That has to be it.

ROBIN: Is there a phone number?

SAM: No, just an address. Sioux Falls, South Dakota. (scoffs)

ROBIN: South Dakota. Okay, uh, l-listen, Sam. Sam, right?

SAM: Yeah.

ROBIN: Look, I'm really sorry, but this is - is where I gotta get off.

SAM: Oh, no, of course. No problem.

ROBIN: Okay. Well, how are you gonna get there?

SAM: (Sam sees a set of car keys on the table and picks them up.) I guess I'll take my car.


EXT. OUTSIDE NITE OWL HOTEL - NIGHT

(Sam & Robin leave the hotel. Sam sees the Impala. He points and they both walk towards the car.)

SAM: That's mine.

ROBIN: Are you sure?

SAM: Oh yeah.

ROBIN: Look, Sam I don't feel right about you going off like this.

SAM: Oh, look, don't worry. Y-you've done way to much for me already.

ROBIN: That's not what I mean. What I mean is uh... I've got a bad feeling you know, with those IDs and that shady-ass hotel room. Whatever you're looking for, you might not like what you find.

SAM: (scoffs) What other choice do I have?

(Sam hears a gun cock.)

ROBIN: You could stick around here a little bit longer, I mean get your head straight, instead of going off, flying blind into...

(Someone shoots at them. Sam knocks Robin to the ground and the bullet hits the Impala's window, shattering it.)

ROBIN: (gasps) What the hell was that?

SAM: Stay down. (He gets up and looks at the shooter. The shooter looks exactly like Sam.)

ROBIN: Sam! Sammy!


INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM

DEAN: Sammy? Come on, snap out of it.

(Sam is unconscious on the bed. Dean watches over him.)

ACT II
INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM

(Play With Fire by The Rolling Stones plays. Sam is unconscious on the bed. Dean paces. Bobby walks in.)

BOBBY: Anything?

DEAN: I can't just sit here, Bobby. I've got to help him.

BOBBY: Dean.

DEAN: You know, dreamscape his noggin. Something.

BOBBY: You know what Cas did. The dam inside your brother's head is gone, and all hell's spilling loose. We don't what's going on inside.

DEAN: I don't care. We have got to do something!

BOBBY: And we will, but right now we got sixteen hours 'til they pop Purgatory. I'm down one man. I can't afford to be down two.

DEAN: Yeah, and how's that going, huh? We've got no line on Crowley. We got no line on Cas. Balthazar's MIA. I mean, all we've got is Sam, going through whatever the hell this is!

BOBBY: You know, (he turns a glass over and pours a drink) this is exactly what Cas wants. For you to fall to pieces. Just try to think of what Sam would want. (He holds out the drink. Dean pauses before taking it.)

DEAN: Find Cas, Bobby. Find him now.


EXT. SAM'S DREAMSCAPE - IMPALA - NIGHT

(Sam is driving, Robin is in the passenger seat. Play With Fire is on the radio.)

SAM: (sniffs) Do you smell whisky?

ROBIN: Okay, Sam, would you focus?

SAM: Yeah. Sorry.

ROBIN: Okay, so, who shot at us?

SAM: I - I didn't really get a good look.

ROBIN: Okay, we gotta go to the cops.

SAM: No, look, if we can just get to my friends, they can help us. I know it.

ROBIN: Okay, you don't know if they're your friends, okay, you don't know anything about anything! Just turn around.

SAM: No. Look, you're safer with me.

ROBIN: How do you know that? You're scaring me.


(In the Panic Room, Dean opens Sam's left eye and shines a flashlight on it. In the dreamscape, Sam is momentarily blinded by a bright light. He slams on the brakes and the tires screech. Suddenly it's day.)

SAM: What? No way. (He gets out the car. Robin follows.)

ROBIN: What was that?

SAM: What do you mean? It's daylight.

ROBIN: Yeah.

SAM: It was night, and now it's day.

ROBIN: It was always day.

SAM: No, no, no, no, no. No, it wasn't. It... What the hell is going on here?

(Sam hears something in the woods next to the road.)

ROBIN: Okay, so I am all filled up on crazy for today. You know what, Sam? I'll - I'll see ya. (She starts to walk away.)

SAM: Wait, wait. Wait. Hey, hey, hey.

(She stops, sighs and turns around.)

SAM: Get in the car. (He gestures to the woods with his head. She hears his urgency and complies. Sam exhales deeply. He opens the boot of the car, seeing all the weapons.) Wow. (He props the boot up with a shotgun and takes a pistol. He cocks it, puts it back and instead takes another shotgun. He cocks it and closes the boot. In the car, Robin sighs nervously.)

(In the woods, Sam walks with his shotgun aimed. He passes a tree and does not see that his lookalike, the shooter from the hotel, is standing behind it. The lookalike walks up behind him and puts a gun to the back of his head. Sam freezes, then turns around quickly. The lookalike - Soulless!Sam - grabs Sam's shotgun and hits him in the head with the gun. He empties the shotgun of shells.)

SOULLESS!SAM: My God. Am I really that gawky? (He throws the shotgun on the ground.) Howdy.

SAM: (shocked) This is impossible.

SOULLESS!SAM: Cold. Try again.

SAM: I'm uh- I'm hallucinating.

SOULLESS!SAM: Warmer. But see, normally, you're awake when you're tripping balls.

SAM: I'm dreaming?

SOULLESS!SAM: And someone just won a copy of the home game. We're inside your grapefruit, Sam. Son, you've been juiced.

SAM: I-I don't remember anything.

SOULLESS!SAM: Well, your BFF Cas brought the Hell-wall tumbling down and you, pathetic infant that you are, shattered into pieces. (he points at Sam) Piece. (he points at himself) Piece.

SAM: I - I have no idea what you're talking about.

SOULLESS!SAM: Why would you? You're jello, pal. Unlike me.

SAM: What are you?

SOULLESS!SAM: I'm not handicapped. I'm not saddled with a soul. In fact, I used to skipper this meatboat for a while. It was smooth sailing. I was sharp, strong. That is, 'til they crammed your soul back in. Now look at you. Same misty-eyed milksop you always were. That's because souls are weak. They're a liability. Now, nothing personal, but run the numbers. Someone's got to take charge around here, before it's too late. (He cocks his gun. Sam runs. He shoots after Sam but misses.)

(Sam runs. Soulless!Sam follows. Sam has a pistol.)

SOULLESS!SAM: (echoing) Come out, come out, wherever you are.

(Sam runs. He hides behind a rock next to a tree near a stream. Soulless!Sam appears. Sam ducks. Soulless!Sam sees Sam's jacket behind the rock. He shoots three times. He walks up to the rock and sees that Sam isn't there, only his jacket. Suddenly, Sam, from behind, shoots Soulless!Sam. The bullet goes through his chest. Soulless!Sam falls to the ground and groans.)

SOULLESS!SAM: You think I'm bad? Wait 'til you meet the other one.

(He dies. A bright light comes out of the body and Sam absorbs it. In the Panic Room, Sam, still unconscious, convulses.
DEAN: Sammy! Sam!
He puts a hand on Sam's chest. Sam is still.)


(Back in the dreamscape, Sam walks back to the road, where Robin is standing next to the car.)

SAM: I remember who I am. Everything I did this past year. And I remember you.


[ (We see Sam's memory of Robin. Sometime during Sam's soulless year, he was at the bar and had a run-in with a crossroads demon. The demon is holding a terrified Robin with a knife to her neck. Sam approaches with a gun.
CROSSROADS DEMON: Walk away or the girl dies.
Sam shoots Robin in the stomach. She dies. She demon looks at Sam in shock.
SAM: There goes your leverage.
Sam shoots the crossroads demon.) ]


(Back in the dreamscape, blood seeps through Robin's shirt by her stomach.)

ROBIN: Didn't I tell you to turn back, that you wouldn't like what you found?

SAM: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

ROBIN: Not as sorry as you're gonna be. (She disappears.)


INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM

(Sam is unconscious. Dean sits near him, a glass of whisky in his hand.)

BOBBY: Look what the cat dragged in.

(Bobby is standing with Balthazar outside the door of the Panic Room. Dean gets up.)

BALTHAZAR: Well, at least you mudfish finally got the angel-proofing right. (he points to Sam) How's Sleeping Beauty? You didn't steal any kisses, I trust?

DEAN: What the hell took you so long? (He walks up to Balthazar. Bobby stands a step behind Dean.)

BALTHAZAR: Honestly? I was having second thoughts.

DEAN: About?

BALTHAZAR: About whether to help you. I was thinking maybe... Maybe I should rip out your sticky bits instead.

BOBBY: And what did you decide?

BALTHAZAR: Well... (He pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to Dean.) Cas and Crowley are there. That's where the show gets started.

(Dean opens the paper and shows Bobby. On it is an address in Bootback, Kansas.)

DEAN: Alright, well give us a minute to pack up and then zap us there.

BALTHAZAR: Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't think so.

DEAN: Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR: I'm betraying a friend here. A very powerful friend. We all are. So I think I've stuck my neck out far enough already. Good luck. (He disappears.)


INT. CROWLEY'S LAB

(Castiel sits. Crowley walks in carrying a jar of blood.)

CROWLEY: Your Purgatory power-shake, Monsieur. (He gives it to Castiel.) Half monster, half virgin.

CASTIEL: Thank you.

CROWLEY: You seem even more constipated than usual. Maybe get you some Colonblow?

CASTIEL: I'm renegotiating our terms.

CROWLEY: Is that so? What terms do you propose?

CASTIEL: You get nothing. Not one single soul.

CROWLEY: Can't help notice, seems a bit unfairly weighted. (Castiel doesn't answer.) Castiel. You wouldn't dare. I brought you this deal.

CASTIEL: You think I'm handing all that power to the king of Hell? I'm neither stupid nor wicked.

CROWLEY: Unbelievable. Have you forgotten that you're the bottom in this relationship?

CASTIEL: Here are your options. You either flee, or you die.

CROWLEY: We made a pact. Even I don't break contracts like this.

CASTIEL: Flee, or die.

CROWLEY: (scoffs) Boy, just can't trust anyone these days. (Crowley disappears.)


INT. SAM'S DREAMSCAPE - BOBBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

(In Bobby's house, the furniture is covered in white sheets. There are candles almost everywhere, but the room is mostly dark. A small amount of moonlight shines through the window. Sam enters the room with a gun. He approaches the desk, where someone is sitting, their face hidden in the shadows.)

SAM: Hey. Hey!

TORTURED!SAM: (his voice is weak) Oh. Hi, Sam.

SAM: So, which one are you?

TORTURED!SAM: Don't you know? (He stands up. His face is bruised.) I'm the one that remembers Hell.

ACT III
INT. BOBBY'S PANIC ROOM

(Bobby is packing some things, including a flask of holy water and two angel blades, in a bag. He takes the bag and starts to walk out.)

BOBBY: Time's up, Dean.

DEAN: Yeah, just a second.

(Dean is standing over Sam. He kneels next to him with a piece of paper.)

DEAN: Alright, this is where we're gonna be, Sam. You get your lazy ass out of bed and come and meet us. Sammy, please.

(He gets up, puts the paper down next to Sam with a gun on top of it, and leaves.)


INT. SAM'S DREAMSCAPE - BOBBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

TORTURED!SAM: I wish you hadn't come, Sam.

SAM: I had to. I'm here, right? Out there in the real world, I'm at Bobby's, aren't I?

TORTURED!SAM: How do you know?

SAM: This whole time, I've smelt nothing but Old Spice and whisky. Figured if I could get back here, back to my body, I could... I don't know, I could snap out of it somehow.

TORTURED!SAM: But first you have to go through me.

SAM: Why?

TORTURED!SAM: Humpty Dumpty has to put himself back together again, before he can wake up. And I'm the last piece.

SAM: Which means, (Sam lowers his gun and steps closer) I have to know what you know. What happened in the cage?

TORTURED!SAM: Trust me, you don't wanna know it.

SAM: You're right. But I still have to.

TORTURED!SAM: Sam, you can't imagine. Stay here, go back, find that bartender, go find Jess, but don't do this. I know you. You're not strong enough.

SAM: (exhales) We'll just have to see.

TORTURED!SAM: (scoffs) Why is this so important to you?

SAM: You know me. You know why. I'm not leaving my brother alone out there.

(Tortured!Sam walks slowly towards Sam. He picks up a knife and Sam defensively points his gun.)

TORTURED!SAM: I'm not gonna fight you. (He holds out the knife, handle first.) But this is your last chance.

(Sam sighs. He lowers his gun and takes the knife.)

TORTURED!SAM: Good luck. You're gonna need it.

(Sam stabs Tortured!Sam in the stomach. Tortured!Sam groans, falls to the ground and dies. A bright light comes from his body and Sam absorbs him. Inside the Panic Room, Sam convulses.)


INT. CROWLEY'S LAB - NIGHT

(Outside the building, angels stand around it as guards.)

(Castiel sits holding the jar of blood. Balthazar appears.)

BALTHAZAR: You rang, Cas?

CASTIEL: Yeah. We have a problem. Dean Winchester is on his way here.

BALTHAZAR: Really? Oh. How'd he even know where we were?

CASTIEL: (he puts the jar down) Apparently we have a Judas in our midst.

BALTHAZAR: Ah. (chuckles) Holy hell. Who is it? I bet it's that bloody little Cherub, isn't it?

CASTIEL: (stands up) I don't know. But I - I need you to find out.

BALTHAZAR: Of course. Um, right away. Right away. Uh, but what do you want me to do about Dean?

CASTIEL: (turns away) Nothing. I'll handle him myself.

BALTHAZAR: Castiel? Are you alright?

CASTIEL: First Sam and Dean, and now this. I'm doing my best in impossible circumstances. My friends, they abandon me, plot against me. It's difficult to understand.

BALTHAZAR: Well you've - you've always got little old me.

(Castiel disappears. He reappears behind Balthazar and stabs him with an angel blade. Balthazar groans.)

CASTIEL: Yes, I'll always have you.

BALTHAZAR: Cas...

(As Balthazar dies, his light fills the building.)


EXT. OUTSIDE BUILDING - NIGHT

(In the street near the building, Dean & Bobby pull up in the Impala. Outside the car, Bobby looks through binoculars at the guards standing around the building.)

BOBBY: I count a dozen mooks, probably more.

DEAN: Demons?

BOBBY: Angels.

DEAN: Well how the hell are we gonna take out that many angels?

BOBBY: We don't. We'll ninja our way in.

DEAN: Awesome. Yeah, 'til they hear your knee squeak.

BOBBY: Shut up.

DEAN: Oh, what, now you got thin skin?

BOBBY: No, shut up. You hear that?

(There is a loud, repetitive booming sound, almost like the footsteps of a giant. Dean & Bobby listen. They turn around.)

DEAN: What the hell is that? (He sees ripples in a puddle from the vibrations.) T-Rex maybe?

(The noise gets louder. Bobby looks up.)

BOBBY: Holy mother of -

(A large cloud of demon smoke approaches.)

DEAN: Get in the car! Get in the car!

(They run to the Impala. Dean gets in the front, Bobby the back. The demon smoke flips the car upside down, then continues towards the building. Inside, Castiel is looking at the paper with the ritual incantation written on it. He hears screams, presumably of the guards. He stands up to listen. Demon smoke covers the window. Crowley appears.)

CROWLEY: Never underestimate the king of Hell, darling. I know a lot of swell tricks. Now, I think it's time to re-renegotiate our terms.

(Castiel disappears. He reappears behind Crowley. Crowley turns around. Castiel puts his hand on Crowley's forehead. Nothing happens.)

CROWLEY: Sweaty hands, mate.

CASTIEL: I don't understand.

CROWLEY: You can palm me all you want. I'm safe and sound under the wing of my new partner. (He gestures to the right, where Raphael appears, in a female vessel.)

RAPHAEL: Hello, Castiel.

CASTIEL: Raphael.

ACT IV
INT. CROWLEY'S LAB - NIGHT

CASTIEL: Consorting with demons. I thought that was beneath you.

RAPHAEL: Heard you were doing it. Sounded like fun.

CROWLEY: You know, Castiel y-you've said all sorts of shameful, appalling, scatological things about Raphael. I-I've found him, her, to be really quite reasonable.

CASTIEL: You fool. Raphael will deceive and destroy you at the speed of thought.

CROWLEY: Right, right, 'cause you're such a straight shooter. She, he, has offered me protection against all comers.

CASTIEL: In exchange for what?

CROWLEY: The Purgatory blood.

RAPHAEL: (clicks tongue) Castiel, you really think I would let you open that door? Take in that much power? If anyone is going to be the new God, it's me.

CASTIEL: He's gonna bring the Apocalypse, and worse.

CROWLEY: Hey, this is your doing, mate. I'm merely grabbing the best offer on the table. Now, you have two options. (in a deep, mocking voice) Flee, or die.

(Castiel picks up the jar of blood. He throws it to Crowley and disappears.)


(The lunar eclipse begins.)

(In front of the blood sigils drawn on the wall, Crowley begins the ritual. Raphael stands next to him.)

CROWLEY: Ianua magna Purgatorii, clausa est ob nos, lumine eius ab oculis nostris retento.


[ (In the overturned Impala, Dean regains consciousness.)
DEAN: Bobby. Bobby?
(Bobby wakes up.)
DEAN: Come on, we gotta go.) ]


(Back in the room.)

CROWLEY: Sed nunc stamus ad limen huius ianuae magnae et demisse, fideliter, perhonorifice, paramus aperire eam. Creaturae terrificae,

(Bobby & Dean enter the room. The stand at the top of the stairs.)

CROWLEY: quarum ungulae et dentes, nunquam tetigerunt carnem humanam.

(Dean throws an angel blade at Raphael. With his back turned, Raphael catches it. He and Crowley turn to look at Bobby and Dean. Telekinetically, Crowley throws Bobby and Dean down the stairs. Dean lands on a table before he is thrown to the ground. He groans.)

CROWLEY: Bit busy, gentlemen. Be with you in a moment.


(Outside, Sam, who is now awake, stops at the upside down Impala. He is hit by a memory of himself on fire, screaming in Lucifer's Cage. He groans and puts his hand on his head. He catches his breath and pushes on, approaching the building.)


(Back in the building.)

CROWLEY: Aperit fauces eius ad mundum nostrum, nunc, ianua magna aperta tandem!

(Nothing happens.)

CROWLEY: Mm-hmmm. Maybe I said it wrong.

(Castiel appears behind them, holding an empty jar of blood.)

CASTIEL: You said it perfectly. All you needed was this. (He puts the jar down. Dean & Bobby get up.)

CROWLEY: I see. (He walks to the wall and touches the blood.) And we've been working with... (he tastes it) Dog blood. Naturally.

RAPHAEL: Enough of these games, Castiel. Give us the blood.

CROWLEY: You- Game's over. His jar's empty. So, Castiel, how'd your ritual go? Better than ours, I'll bet.

(Castiel closes his eyes. A bright light comes from him. It fills the room and Dean, Bobby, Crowley and Raphael shield their eyes.)

FINAL ACT
INT. CROWLEY'S LAB - NIGHT

(Castiel's light fades away.)

CASTIEL: You can't imagine what it's like. They're all inside me. Millions upon millions of souls.

CROWLEY: Sounds sexy. Exit stage Crowley. (He disappears.)

(Raphael looks frightened.)

CASTIEL: Now, what's the matter, Raphael? Somebody clip your wings?

RAPHAEL: Castiel, please. You let the demon go, but not your own brother?

CASTIEL: The demon I have plans for. You on the other hand... (Castiel snaps his fingers; Raphael explodes. The angel blade Raphael had been holding falls to the ground.) So, you see, I saved you.

DEAN: Sure thing, Cas. Thank you.

CASTIEL: You doubted me, fought against me, but I was right all along.

DEAN: Okay, Cas, you were. We're sorry. Now let's just defuse you, okay?

CASTIEL: What do you mean?

DEAN: You're full of nuke. It's not safe. So, before the eclipse ends, let's get them souls back to where they belong.

CASTIEL: Oh no, they belong with me.

DEAN: No, Cas, it's it-it's scrambling your brain.

CASTIEL: No, I'm not finished yet. Raphael had many followers, and I must punish them all severely.

DEAN: Listen to me. Listen, I know there's a lot of bad water under the bridge, but we were family once. I'd have died for you. I almost did a few times. So if that means anything to you... Please. I've lost Lisa, I've lost Ben, and now I've lost Sam. Don't make me lose you too. You don't need this kind of juice anymore, Cas. Get rid of it before it kills us all.

CASTIEL: You're just saying that because I won. Because you're afraid. (Behind him, Sam picks up the angel blade.) You're not my family, Dean. I have no family.

(Sam stabs Castiel in the back with the angel blade. Sam groans. Nothing happens. Castiel pulls the blade out. There's no blood on it. He puts it down.)

CASTIEL: I'm glad you made it, Sam. But the angel blade won't work, because I'm not an angel anymore. I'm your new God. A better one. So you will bow down and profess your love unto me, your Lord. Or I shall destroy you.
