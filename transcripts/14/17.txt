TITLE CARD

ACT ONE

[in the bunker library, Dean is hard at work building the board game, Mousetrap, and struggling to make it work]
DEAN: Come on.
[in the bunker kitchen, Jack and Mary prepare snacks]
MARY: Do you think we have enough?
DEAN (loud enough to be heard from the library): Son of a bitch!
MARY (startled at Dean's shout): What --
JACK: I thought this was supposed to relax him.
MARY: Um, it will-- I hope. I just thought it would be nice to stay in for a change. You know, this was his favorite game when he was little. How about you? Feeling better?
JACK: Everybody keeps asking me that.
MARY: We're family. It's our job.
JACK: Well, it's annoying.
MARY: Jack… if you ever want to talk or...vent...
JACK: You're here. I know.
MARY: All right.
[in the bunker library, Jack and Mary enter with snacks]
DEAN: Winchester game night is a go-- soon as Sammy gets back here with the two double-pepperoni meat blasters and a pineapple.
JACK: I like it.
DEAN: Yeah, it's like a crime against humanity.
MARY (handing Dean his phone): You missed a call.
Dean: Oh.
VOICE ON PHONE: Dean.
MARY: What's wrong?
[Dean listens to his voice mail, and then plays it for everyone to hear]
DONATELLO: Help me, please! Dean. It's me. It's Donatello.
JACK: Donatello?
DONATELLO: I need help. You and Sam. Help me, please! Hith-'o-rehr, shqodh… ki'o-yivkha has-sa-tan, k'ar-yeh sho-'ehgh, mith-hal-lehkh, u-mvaq-qehsh 'eth asher, yval-leha'.
[Dean hangs up and immediately dials Sam's phone]
SAM'S VOICE MAIL: You've reached Sam Winchester. If this is an emergency, call my brother.
DEAN: Sam's not answering his phone. This whole damn town's a dead zone. All right. We got to go.
JACK: What do I do?
DEAN: Stay here. When Sam gets back, play him that voicemail and have him call me on my spare. Got it?
JACK: Got it.
DEAN: So much for game night.

[at Cindy's Waffelette restaurant, Anael arrives and joins Cas at a table]
♪ We had a quarrel ♪
ANAEL: Wow. This place is so… Ugh.
CASTIEL: I appreciate you coming.
ANAEL: Well, you said you had something for me.
WAITRESS: Hi. Can I get you some coffee?
ANAEL: No. Thank you.
CASTIEL: Yes.
♪ For I still love you ♪
[Cas hands her a box with a pair of earrings]
ANAEL: 16th-century Burmese blood rubies. Five carats. Excellent clarity. Castiel, where did you get these?
CASTIEL: On a case. They are lightly cursed, but it's nothing that would affect an angel.
ANAEL: Uh-huh. And you're giving these to me?
CASTIEL: No. No. I-I need something. I need your help. To contact God.
ANAEL: Yeah. Good luck with that.
CASTIEL: You forget, Anael, I know you. I know what you did before your demotion. When you were Joshua's right hand. And I know that God spoke to Joshua. And only to Joshua. Now, he's dead, but-- but you understand how they communicated.
ANAEL: Why do you want to know?
CASTIEL: There's a nephilim-- Jack.
ANAEL: Lucifer's son?
CASTIEL: Yes. Jack killed Michael.
ANAEL: Good night, sweet prince.
CASTIEL: But to do so, he-- he used magic that consumed his soul. Not all of it, I hope, but we just don't know how much Jack has left. And I've been looking through all the lore, and it all says the same thing.
ANAEL: Only God can restore a soul. And that's why you need him.
CASTIEL: Right.
ANAEL: The Winchesters-- they don't know you're here, do they?
CASTIEL: Why do you say that?
ANAEL: Oh, I don't know, just a general reek of ill-conceived lone-wolf desperation.
CASTIEL: Will you help me or not?
ANAEL: Not. Sorry. You see, Joshua never spoke to God. God spoke to him. There's a big difference.
CASTIEL: I see.
[Cas reaches over to collect the earrings and Anael reconsiders]
ANAEL: But… there was a rumor. A whisper, after the Fall. Joshua placed a long-distance call, and God picked up.
CASTIEL: Okay. How?
ANAEL: I don't know. I wasn't there. But I know someone who was, and I can take you to them.

[Sam at the bunker, on the phone with Dean in the Impala]
SAM: I should be there with you.
DEAN: It's fine.
SAM: No, it's not.
DEAN: You heard Donny's message, right?
SAM: Yeah, I did.
DEAN: He sounds like he's speaking in tongues-- like he's possessed again.
SAM: No, that's not-- It's not Enochian. I-I-I think it's Ancient Hebrew.
MARY: What's he saying?
SAM: We don't know yet. I'm still working on it.
DEAN: All right, well, work fast.
SAM: Watch your back.
DEAN: That's the plan.
[they hang up]
DEAN: Ancient Hebrew. What the hell? Sammy sounds stressed.
MARY: It's not just Sam. It's Jack… it's you. I just wish there was something that I c--
DEAN: Hey. You're here, okay? You're here.
MARY: But I should've been here more. But I know how I am. I can be closed off… and hard.
DEAN: Yeah, well, that's where I get it from.
MARY: Listen. I just need you to know… I'm grateful. For every day I get to spend with you and Sam.

[in the bunker, Sam listens to Donatello's recording with Jack]
DONATELLO: Hith-'o-rehr, shqodh… ki 'o-yivkha has-sa-tan, k'ar-yeh sho-'ehgh…
SAM: Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait.
DONATELLO: ...mith-hal-lehkh...
SAM: This --
DONATELLO: ...u-mvaq-qehsh...
SAM: I know this.
DONATELLO: ...'eth asher yval-leha'.
JACK: What?
SAM: Donatello's message-- i-it's-- It's from the Bible. It's-- it's Peter. Peter 5:8.Here. "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour."

[Dean and Mary arrive at Donatello's house and rush inside]
DEAN: Donatello?!
DONATELLO: Oh, please! Dean! Please!
DEAN: Donatello?!
DONATELLO: Help me, Dean! Help! Ohh! Oh! Sam! Dean! Help! Help me!
[Donatello's voice was recorded on his phone, playing back on the dining table, and Nick steps out of the kitchen wearing Donatello's apron]
NICK: Good. You made it.

ACT TWO

[Dean handcuffs Nick at Donatello's house and interrogates him with Mary]
DEAN: Where's Donatello?
NICK: What, no "hey"? "How ya been"? So it's just you, huh? Sammy's home sick?
DEAN: How are you even--
NICK: Here? Instead of rotting away in a jail cell where you left me? Sort of a funny story… and by "funny," I mean a lot of people died.
MARY (bringing the syringe used on Donatello earlier): No one's here, but… I saw this in the trash.
NICK: Dumpster diving. Classy, Mamabear.
DEAN: What did you do?
NICK: Nothing. I mean, I sort of injected your friend with poison-- thallium, to be exact. So he's got about a day before his internal organs start shutting down. But that's just sort of a "guesstimate."
MARY: Why?
NICK: To get your attention. I mean, he was -- is, sorry is -- one of your friends, right, and you don't have a lot of those.
DEAN: I'm not buying a word of this.
NICK (nodding to his phone, encouraging Dean to pick it up): No? Hit the live-stream button. You can save him if you can find him.
DEAN: Where is he?!
NICK: Ooh, the angry voice. Hey, if you kill me, you kill him. Do it. What do I got to live for? Go.
MARY: What do you want?
NICK: I want to talk.

[Cas and Anna arrive at Orlando’s Emporium]
METHUSELAH: We're closed.
ANAEL: Even for us, Methuselah?
METHUSELAH: Yeah.
CASTIEL: We're friends of Joshua.
METHUSELAH: Joshua didn't have any friends.
ANAEL: Except you. You sheltered him after the Fall.
METHUSELAH: I didn't "shelter"-- We were roommates. Okay? He made a mean lasagna.
CASTIEL: You saw him try to contact God. How did he do it?
METHUSELAH: Yeah. Maybe try asking him.
ANAEL: Can't. Dead.
METHUSELAH: Well, guess you're outta luck.
CASTIEL: No. You'll tell me, or I'll burn this place to the ground and you with it.
METHUSELAH: Kiddo, how old am I? Go for it. Put me out of my misery.
CASTIEL (eyes glowing): Is that really what you want?
METHUSELAH: The, um, thingamajig he used, it's around here somewhere.
CASTIEL: Where?
METHUSELAH: I don't know. Somewhere. You're angels, right? I'm sure you'll know it when you see it. Or not.

[Mary and Dean bring Nick back to the bunker, where they’re confronted by Sam and Jack. Sam grabs Nick and slams him into a wall]
DEAN: Whoa! Hey. Hey! Not now. Okay? Not yet.
[Sam storms off, and they reconvene in the library]
SAM: But he was-- He was just sitting there waiting for you? That doesn't make any sense. What kind of game is he playing here?
DEAN: I don't know. If you ask me, that psycho's seen way too many '90s serial-killer movies.
SAM: Nick doesn't even know Donatello.
DEAN: Lucifer did.
MARY: It doesn't make any sense to me, either, but Donatello-- we're-- we're running out of time.
SAM: The poison we can handle-- thallium. The antidote is Prussian Blue. We have some of that here. A-And the live feed Nick showed you, um, maybe I can hack that?
DEAN: Good. Great.
SAM: But it's gonna take time. Maybe more than we have.
DEAN: All right, well, Nick said he wanted to talk. So let's talk.
SAM (angrily following Dean): Yeah, let's talk.
DEAN: Hey, hey. - No, no, no.
SAM: What?
DEAN: I need you to stay here.
SAM: Why?
DEAN: The way you are right now-- if Nick looks at you wrong, you're gonna waste him. That can't happen!
SAM: All right. Yeah. Sure. Not yet.
DEAN: Right. [Dean leaves to interrogate Nick]
MARY: Sam…
SAM: Donatello's in this because of me. A police officer is dead because of me. I'm the one who let Nick go, I'm the one who… What was I thinking?
MARY: You thought he deserved a chance.
SAM: Yeah, well, he didn't.
MARY: Sam, look at me. Nick's choices are his. Just his. You didn't know th--
SAM: That's not an excuse.
MARY: No one's making excuses, but-- You gave him a chance because you felt for him… because you're a good man. You are. It's one of the reasons I'm so proud of you.

[at Methuselah's shop, Anael and Cas continue to rummage through the dusty collection. Cas blows dust off an old doll and Anael coughs]
ANAEL: Are you insane? This is Mulberry silk.
CASTIEL: Sorry. So, Methuselah said…
ANAEL: We'd know it when we'd see it. Right. No.
CASTIEL: Well, you might. When you were working for Joshua, did you ever--
ANAEL: Even if we found Joshua's batphone, God's not gonna care. You wanna know how I know?
CASTIEL: How?
ANAEL: You ever wonder why a vaunted apprentice became a lowly button pusher?
CASTIEL: Well, I heard that Joshua offered you more responsibility, and you just walked away.
ANAEL: I believed in Heaven. You know, our mission. I believed, Castiel. But then I got to Earth, and I saw that it wasn't the paradise God promised. I mean, there was so much hate… so much suffering. So I asked Joshua-- I mean, these were God's creations-- his perfect people. Why wasn't he helping them? And do you know what he said?
CASTIEL: No.
ANAEL: "God doesn't meddle." He doesn't meddle? Well, I do. So I do.
CASTIEL: And here I thought you just performed miracles for the money.
ANAEL: Well, you haven't been paying attention, then. I do them for me. I don't need Heaven. And I don't need God. And… I'm happy, Castiel.
CASTIEL: Really? Because that sounds lonely.
ANAEL: We're all lonely, because we're all alone. From ant to lion to human to angel. Every last one of us.
CASTIEL: You know, he does meddle. God reached down, and he brought me back to life.
ANAEL: So he saves one angel… and watches millions of people die screaming, every day. What does that say about him?

[in the bunker’s dungeon, Nick is tied to a chair, and Dean punches him in the face]
DEAN: Where's Donatello?
NICK: You having fun?
DEAN: Oh, yeah. Having a riot.
NICK: I get you, Dean. You and me, we're almost like brothers, you know. Michael, you, Lucifer, me-- we both know what it's like to be hog-tied to a nuclear warhead, man.
DEAN: Mm. [Dean punches Nick again] Cut the crap. Where is he?
NICK: You're never the same after something like that, are ya? Being one with one of them. It changes you. Makes you more than human. Come on, Dean, admit it. With Michael, you were a prince. Now you're just a broken Hunter. You're too stupid to know you've been beat.
DEAN: Beat? What are you beating me at? Hmm? Come on, Nick. What's this all about?
NICK: I want to see my son.

[in the library, Dean talks to Mary, Jack and Sam]
MARY: His son? He said that?
DEAN: He says he wants to talk to Jack… alone.
MARY: No. Absolutely not.
JACK: I'm not afraid of him.
DEAN: Nick's cracked. He's friggin' Cocoa Puffs, okay?
JACK: Sam?
SAM: I mean--
DEAN: "I mean"? What do you mean, you mean?
SAM: I-I mean… Look, finding Donatello is going slowly, Dean, and Nick is locked down in our bunker. How's he even a threat?
MARY: He's always a threat.
JACK: Donatello helped me, and now he needs my help. He's my friend.
SAM: And I don't think we have another choice.

[Jack enters the dungeon and confronts Nick]
NICK: Hey, sonny boy.
JACK: Where's Donatello?
NICK: Wow. You're so tough. That's your pop, you realize.
JACK: My father was a monster.
NICK: Everybody's a monster. Even your three dads-- how many innocent people you think they've killed?
JACK: Answer the question!
NICK: He loved you. You know that? He did. I felt it. He loved you so much… and you broke his heart. Of course, I'm talking about the old you. You with the soul. Yeah. Kermit the Prophet told me all about your sitch. What's that like, not having a soul? Must be relaxing.
JACK: I have a soul.
NICK: I don't know. I don't-- I don't see it. I'm looking right at you, and I see nothing.
JACK (yelling in Nick’s face): I have a soul!
[Nick headbutts Jack, breaking his nose. Jack heals himself and cleans the blood from his face, and his eyes continue glowing gold as he angrily looms over Nick]
NICK: Y-You good? Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm s-- sorry. I'm serious.

ACT THREE

[Jack leaves the dungeon, and Mary, Dean, and Sam are waiting for him in the hall]
MARY: How'd it go? Did he...?
JACK: Nick. He'll show us where to find Donatello.

[At Methuselah's shop, Anael picks up a doll]
DOLL: Mama! Mama! Mama.
ANAEL (tossing the doll away) Ugh! Yeah. I'm done. Look, I just stepped on a rat, so --
CASTIEL: Anael--
ANAEL: Skip it. Skip the whole judgmental crap designed to play at my insecurities, and I will skip my inevitable witty reply about the real reason you're doing all this.
CASTIEL: What do you mean the real reason? I'm doing this for Jack.
ANAEL: No, you're not. You're doing this because you're afraid. Because in your mind, it'd be easier to call God than to tell Sam and Dean Winchester the truth.
CASTIEL: The truth?
ANAEL: Jack's soul is gone, Castiel. And there's nothing you can do about it. Look. I don't want to say all that and hurt your feelings, so...what do you say we call it a night?

[Dean drives Sam and Nick in the Impala]
NICK: Boy, that Jack has… got issues, right?

[at Methuselah's shop]
METHUSELAH: You throwin' in the towel?
[Cas is about to leave when Anael reminds him about the earrings he promised her. He watches her pick up her bag and notices something]
ANAEL: Hey. Our deal?
CASTIEL: I've seen that before.
ANAEL: Where? Crystal shop? A dollar store? Ren fair?
CASTIEL (picking up an amulet similar to the one Dean used to wear): No. The one I know, it-- it glows in the presence of-- of God. This is what we're looking for.
METHUSELAH: Good eye. Joshua forged it after he Fell.
ANAEL: That thing talks to God?
METHUSELAH: Only one way to find out.
CASTIEL (clutching the amulet): God… I don't know where you are. I don't know if you can hear me. But please. Sam, Dean-- we need you. Please.
METHUSELAH: Yeah, it never worked for Joshua, either.

[in the Impala, parked on a hill overlooking an industrial park]
NICK: So, the warehouse is just down there. Want me to show you?
DEAN: No. You're gonna stay here.
NICK: All by my lonesome?
DEAN: Look, you try anything funny, Sammy's gonna shoot you. Anything happens to me--
NICK: Wait. Let me guess. Sammy's gonna shoot me.
SAM: Yeah, to start. [he hands something to Dean] Here. Antidote. Donatello.

[Anael and Cas leaving Methuselah's shop]
ANAEL: It's too bad. I would have really enjoyed giving God a piece of my mind. But what can I say. I'm always right. So, what are you gonna do now?
CASTIEL: Go home. Go home and tell Sam and Dean the truth.
ANAEL: And then?
CASTIEL: I don't know. Oh.
[he hands over the earrings]
ANAEL: Thank you. It's been swell.
CASTIEL: Do you need a ride?
ANAEL: I'll call a cab.
CASTIEL: Anael. You know, you're not always right. Just because God's not with us doesn't mean we're alone.
ANAEL: Why? Because we all have each other?
CASTIEL: Yes.

[in the bunker library, Mary packs up things they found at Donatello’s house, including the syringe]
JACK: You hear from Sam and Dean?
MARY: No, not yet.
JACK: What's all this?
MARY: Some stuff we found at Donatello's. It's not helping.
JACK (picking up the syringe): This… this was grace. Can't you feel it? This was filled with angelic grace.

[Dean heads into the industrial building, while Nick and Sam wait in the Impala]
NICK: It's nice that we're finally alone. I feel like I never get a chance to talk to you anymore.
[Sam's phone rings]
NICK (singing mockingly): Oh, Sammy boy, Sammy boy ♪
♪ Your phone, your phone is calling ♪
SAM: Mom? Mom? Hey.
[Sam gets out of the car to escape Nick's singing, and Nick uses the chance to escape from his handcuffs]
♪ Sammy boy, oh, Sammy boy ♪
♪ The phone is calling ♪
SAM: No. He's not back yet. Yeah.

[Inside a warehouse room inside the industrial complex, Dean is being watched, but finds Donatello tied up and hurries to untie him]
DEAN: Hey. All right.

[Outside, Sam has his back to the car and is still on the phone with Mary, Nick struggles to free himself]
SAM: He's sure? Damn it.
[Sam hangs up and forces Nick out of the car]
SAM: Out of the car! Get out of the car!
NICK: All right, all right, all right. Whoa. Whoa! Oh, whoa, whoa. Was that Mamabear?
SAM: There was never any poison. You injected Donatello with angel grace. Why?!
NICK: Wow. She figured it out. That's good.
SAM (pulling a gun on Nick): Talk!
NICK: Prophets are sort of like old CB radios. You boost their power or you mess with their frequency...
SAM: CB radio? Y-You trying to communicate with someone? Who?
NICK: Search your feelings, Sam.
SAM: No. No. Lucifer's dead. He's in the Empty.
NICK: Yeah, and he's awake… and with the help of your little prophet friend, I was able to have a convo with him, and he told me how to bring him back.
[flash to a scene of Donatello, tied to his dining table, channeling Lucifer]
LUCIFER: It won't be easy. You'll have to prove yourself. The Winchesters will be a problem. But you can use that, twist it… find a way to get to my son. His blood. You need his blood.
NICK: Come on, Sam. Nobody stays dead anymore. You know that. All you need is a little elbow grease, some new friends. Where you think I got that angel grace? Who do you think hid me after I carved up that cop? Demons. Yeah. They want Lucifer back almost as much as me. So, thanks.
SAM: Dean!
[Nick drops his handcuffs and attacks Sam, while demons attack Dean inside. Sam chokes Nick until he seems to pass out, but Nick grabs a stone and hits Sam on the head. Dean fights off two demons.]
NICK: Lucifer's perfect vessel. Not so perfect now, are ya?
[Nick hits Sam with the rock again. And Sam locks himself inside the Impala]
NICK: Come on, Sam. Hit play, baby. Come on, Sam! Come on!
[Sam honks the horn, and Dean kills the last demon, running outside to find Sam gravely injured and Nick escaped]
SAM: Dean! Dean.
DEAN: Sam? Hey, hey, hey. Sammy.

ACT FOUR

[Nick runs through the woods and flags down a truck]
NICK: Hey!
[Dean tends to Sam, and calls Mary to update her]
DEAN: Nick-- he's trying to resurrect Lucifer.
MARY: How?
DEAN: I don't know! I don't know. He played us.
[Nick approaches the truck that stops for him]
NICK: Oh, God. Help me.
[Nick pulls the driver of the truck out and throws him down in the road]
TRUCK DRIVER: Hey! Hey!
[in the bunker library]
JACK: We have to stop him.
[Nick gets in the truck and drives off]
NICK: Thanks.
DEAN: Yeah, well, we don't even where he is, okay? And he hurt Sam. He got him in the head. I don't even want to move him. We called an ambulance, but they said 20 minutes. It's not good, Mom. It's really bad.
MARY: We're on our way.

[Nick drives to an abandoned house in the woods and breaks in. He finds salt, a knife, and a heavy pot. He makes a salt circle, then removes his blood-stained shirt, then cuts his hand and bleeds onto it and shoves it in the pot. He lights a match and sets the shirt on fire. Back at the bunker, Jack doubles over in pain.]
MARY: What is it?
JACK: I feel-- It feels like my blood's burning. He has it.
[flashback to Nick headbutting Jack in the dungeon to get Jack's blood]
JACK: I have a soul!
[in the library again]
MARY: This was about you, Jack. All of it. He needed your blood.
JACK: I feel it. I can feel him.

[Nick chants in the salt circle over the fire]
NICK: ...qui dormiunt, ad dominum formosum. Nexus noster, restitutus est.

[in the library]
MARY: Where? Where is he?
JACK: I think I know-- I think I-I can get us to him. But I need to use my powers.
MARY: Do it.

[Nick continues chanting and a rift to the empty appears, and a black, shimmering Lucifer emerges from it and reaches toward Nick]
NICK: Surgas ex abysso, in lumine exsistas! Lucifer. I'm here. I'm ready. Your vessel. Your perfect vessel. Make me strong again. Make me you.
[Jack and Mary appear, and Jack closes the rift, sealing Lucifer on the other side]
NICK: No! No, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What did you do?! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[Jack's eyes continue to glow, and he tortures Nick, breaking all the bones in his hand by magic, and then slowly burning Nick from the inside]
MARY: Jack!
NICK: Aah!
MARY: Jack! What are you doing?! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Jack, stop it!
[Nick finally falls to the ground, dead]

ACT FIVE

[at the Impala, Dean continues to try to save Sam as they wait for the ambulance]
DEAN: Hey. Hey. Come on. Stay with me now. We're just gonna play a little game. We're gonna count, okay? We're gonna count. Count with me. One... two...
SAM: Two.
DEAN: Yeah, there you go. ...three.
SAM: You-- You always put-- You always put me first.
DEAN: No, no. Shh, shh. Come on. Come on, man.
SAM: Your whole life...
DEAN: Okay. All right. All right. Come on. Come on. Just count with me. Sammy. Hey! Sam!

[in the cabin, Mary looks down at Nick's body, horrified]
JACK: Mary? I had to.
MARY: Uh… Sam-- Uh, he's hurt. Help him.

[Jack vanishes, and appears near the Impala]
JACK: Dean? Sam.
[Jack rushes to Sam and heals him]
SAM: Nick. Where's Nick?
JACK: I stopped him. It's over.
SAM: What about Mom?
JACK: She's fine. Everything's gonna be fine.

[Jack returns to the cabin and finds Mary outside]
JACK: I healed Sam. Everything's gonna be okay.
MARY: Good. That's good.
JACK: Mary. Nick… he was a bad person, a killer. I had to stop him.
MARY: Not like that.
JACK: He deserved it.
MARY: Take me home, Jack.
JACK: I-I will. I will. I-I just… Tell me it's okay.
MARY: It's not. You're not. You… It's not your fault, but the Jack I know would never have done that. You -- You're… Something's wrong.
JACK: No, I'm not. You're wrong.
MARY: Sweetheart. You know I'm not.
JACK: You know, Sam and Dean, they were grateful.
MARY: If Sam and Dean saw what you did, they would be as worried as I am.
JACK: Are you gonna tell them?
MARY: You need help, we'll help you. We're your family.
JACK: You can't.
MARY: We care about you, Jack.
JACK: No, just leave me alone.
MARY: Jack.
JACK: Leave me alone. Please, just-- Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Please. Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
[Jack walks off, clutching his head against a ringing noise as he becomes more and more agitated. Mary follows, wanting to help.]
MARY: What's happening?
JACK: Leave me alone!
MARY: What's going on?
JACK: Leave me alone!
MARY: Jack, just… Listen! Jack? Please! Listen to me!
[Jack turns to Mary, eyes glowing gold, and yells]
JACK: Leave me alone!
[the screen goes black, and Jack whispers]
Mary?
