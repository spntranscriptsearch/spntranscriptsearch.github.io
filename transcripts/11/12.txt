TEASER
[EXTERIOR - SIOUX FALLS, SOUTH DAKOTA - NIGHT]

[Two teens are in a truck, presumably on a date. The boy takes a drink from a flask and hands it to the girl, who also takes a drink.]

THE BOY

It's like tumbleweeds out there. Where is everybody?

THE GIRL

Maybe they moved on to their winter humping grounds? It's freezing.

THE BOY

You wanna get out of here?

THE GIRL

No. We finally got the place to ourselves.

[THE GIRL kisses THE BOY on the neck.]

THE BOY

You don't like it when the uh - car next to you's bumping up and down and you hear groaning?

THE GIRL

Nobody can hear us. Can they?

THE BOY

Not tonight.

[They kiss, and start making out. There is rustling in the bushes next to the truck, and all of a sudden, the door of the truck opens and the BOY is dragged out of it. The GIRL screams. The BOY is thrown to the ground, and a sword is held to his throat. The sword-wielder is revealed to be CLAIRE NOVAK.]

GIRL

(Yelling) What the hell are you doing?

CLAIRE

He knows. Don't you?

BOY

I swear. I don't know anything. Please.

CLAIRE

What are you?

[The BOY looks terrified as he shakes his head.]

CLAIRE

(Yelling) WHAT ARE YOU?

[The BOY doesn't answer, just continues to struggle, looking very scared. CLAIRE looks back and forth between the BOY and the GIRL but does not withdraw the sword.]

[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE
[INTERIOR - THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM - DAY]

[SAM is sitting at the table. DEAN enters.]

DEAN

Did you catch us a case?

SAM

Uh, no. Get this. Some dude took a picture of a weasel riding a flying woodpecker. Midair. It's kinda nuts.

DEAN

So, I'm guessing there's nothing on the Amara meter either.

SAM

Uh, no. I'm starting to think that God's psycho sister has gone to ground. What about you, you hear from Cas?

DEAN

No. He said he was working on something to draw her out, but… it's been radio silence since he was here.

SAM

Yeah. All this quiet's starting to wake me up.

[DEAN pulls out his takeout food from a bag and places it on the table, looking very excited.]

SAM

What the hell is that?

DEAN

That? That's the Elvis.

SAM

Elvis?

DEAN

Mmm-hmm.

SAM

(Reaching out to touch it) Is that a - ?

DEAN

That's a glazed donut.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Two, actually. One topside, one on the bottom. Now, your inferior versions, they'll just take one donut, split it right down the middle. Mmm mm. (Clicks his tongue.) Boom! (Blows a kiss.)

SAM

(Looking slightly amused) Alright, well uh, I hope you enjoy it.

[SAM slides it away from him.]

SAM

Wow.

[DEAN looks offended.]

DEAN

You know there are starving children out there.

SAM

Dude, I'm not gonna survive hundreds of monster attacks to get flatlined by some double donut monstrosity.

DEAN

The Elvis!

[DEAN's phone rings.]

SAM

Whatever! How many calories are in that thing?

[DEAN answers his phone.]

DEAN

Hey! Long time. Your Caddyshack review is way overdue.

Yeah. You got it. We're there.

[SAM looks up as DEAN hangs up.]

DEAN

How do you feel about South Dakota?

[EXTERIOR - MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL, SIOUX FALLS, SD - DAY]

[The bell has just rung, and students are leaving for the day. ALEX is leaving the building, holding hands with her boyfriend. A girl runs up from behind them.]

GIRL

Hey! Word on the street is that I'm in the presence of royalty. Future prom king and queen. You guys are in the lead!

ALEX

No way! No I mean - yeah, for you (looking at her boyfriend), Henry, but not me. Also, people still do that? I thought that was like an 80s thing.

HENRY

Oh yeah! There's crowns and everything.

[JODY MILLS watches ALEX at a distance from her truck.]

HENRY

Come on, let's have fun with it. I'll wear the dress, you wear the tux?

ALEX (Smirking) You don't have the boobs for my dress.

HENRY

What? Come on, look at those things.

[ALEX laughs, then notices one of her teachers walking past.]

ALEX

Hey, Mr. P!

MR. P

Alex! Ready for the test tomorrow?

ALEX

So not.

MR. P

Well lucky you've got… (looks at his watch) 18 hours to prep. Good times.

[JODY honks the horn.]

ALEX

See ya!

[ALEX kisses HENRY. JODY, still watching, smiles and looks away. ALEX gets in the truck with JODY.]

ALEX

Oh my god. Chem lab, I fell asleep in a pool of my own drool. Oh, and coach is pulling double practice tomorrow, mid field needs serious tightening.

[JODY just looks at ALEX, smiling.]

ALEX

What?

[JODY shakes her head.]

JODY

Just - you're killing it out there.

ALEX Shut up.

[JODY laughs, then happens to look down and see some pills sticking out ALEX's bag. She starts the car as it starts to rain.]

JODY

Fitting right in.

[They drive away, and the scene cuts to the truck pulling into the driveway of JODY and ALEX's house. They see the Impala parked in the driveway.]

JODY

Winchesters.

ALEX

Why would they be here?

JODY

(Shrugs) I didn't put up the bat signal.

[They enter the house to find SAM and DEAN sitting in the living room.]

JODY

Well, there goes the neighborhood. Hi.

SAM

Jody.

[SAM and Jody hug.]

SAM

Hey. Let me help you out.

[SAM takes the grocery bags from JODY.]

JODY

Oh thank you!

SAM

Yeah, sure.

JODY

(To Dean, holding her arms open for a hug) Come here.

DEAN

It has been too long.

JODY

Hey.

[DEAN and JODY hug.]

SAM

Yeah, clearly it's been too long, 'cause Alex, that is you, right?

ALEX

I don't look that different!

CLAIRE

It's amazing what you can accomplish when you spend two hours in the bathroom every morning.

ALEX

Since when are you even up in the morning, I'm surprised you're awake now.

JODY

Hey! I'm pretty sure the guys didn't come here to watch you two kill each other. Is everything okay? I didn't accidentally butt dial you or anything, did I?

CLAIRE

I called. About the monsters. That you refuse to believe are monsters.

JODY

Oh - you gotta be kidding. (To SAM and DEAN) You know, if you'd checked in with me, I could have saved you a trip.

DEAN

Well, we figured we owed you a visit.

JODY

And you know what, actually - I could use the backup. (To Sam) Let me have that.

[JODY takes the grocery bags back.]

SAM

Yep.

JODY

I'm gonna put another chicken on. You settle in.

DEAN

…You might wanna make it two.

SAM

(To DEAN) Yeah.

DEAN

(In an undertone) I'm starving.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - JODY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT]

[JODY, CLAIRE, ALEX, SAM, and DEAN are all sitting at the table eating a chicken dinner. SAM and DEAN are eating like they haven't had a proper meal in a long time, clearly enjoying themselves. JODY, CLAIRE, and ALEX watch them with restrained amusement.]

DEAN

(Mouth full) Mmm! Oh, this bird is fantastic.

[JODY looks at him.]

DEAN

When you mix it up with the - potatoes and the, the beans, you guys eat like this every day?

JODY

It's just chicken.

SAM

It's shaped like chicken! Not a patty, or a nugget!

CLAIRE

Can we get to the case?

[Long pause as SAM and DEAN look at her while ripping into their dinner rolls.]

CLAIRE

Three people are missing.

JODY

There is no evidence that they didn't skip town on their own! Two of them were runaways, one was a homeless guy.

CLAIRE

He was last seen at Braden Point. I've been stalking it out.

DEAN

Right.

[DEAN reaches over SAM to help himself to another generous helping of mashed potatoes.]

SAM

Dude!

DEAN

There's plenty left. Braden Point?

JODY

It's where the kids go to make out, and yes, there's about four pounds left on the stove.

CLAIRE

Guys? There's something out there.

[DEAN looks at her as he continues to stuff his face.]

CLAIRE

People are reporting animals they've never seen before, things stalking their front yards that disappear…

[ALEX looks at her, annoyed.]

JODY

This is according to the - HEY!

[JODY looks at ALEX, who has tried to sneak her wine glass away.]

JODY

Put it back!

[ALEX puts the wine glass back.]

JODY

(Continuing from where she left off) … neighborhood crime blogs that Claire has been reading.

CLAIRE

They're eye-witness accounts.

SAM

Well, we've hunted on less.

DEAN

What else you got?

CLAIRE

Uh, I'm working on it.

ALEX

Claire did catch a werewolf. Oh right! Turned out to be a German shepherd with rabies.

JODY

And before that was the vampire. Councilwoman into erotic cosplay. I didn't know what cosplay was before that. Super embarrassing for the whole force.

DEAN

Wow. You've been busy.

CLAIRE

I've been hunting.

JODY

AKA menacing innocent people! Claire has a whole string of assaults racked up. The only reason she's not sitting in jail right now is that I'm the sheriff!

CLAIRE

Fine, I've been wrong. But this time, I know there's a monster.

ALEX

Can we stop talking about monsters, and hunting? What about real life?

CLAIRE

Real life? Okay. Yeah, sure. Let's get real. You and Henry set on a weekend yet?

ALEX

What?

CLAIRE

When you sneaking off to Jody's cabin to screw yourself silly?

[ALEX's eyes get wide, and she looks cornered.]

DEAN

Ohhh. Here we go.

[SAM and DEAN look awkward. JODY looks shocked.]

ALEX

Um, we're not - ! (To CLAIRE) You're completely insane!

CLAIRE

You might wanna clear your g-tracks before you commit to that.

SAM

(About ready to get up from the table) This seems like uh, family business.

[JODY hits the table.]

JODY

Sit! Stay!

[CLAIRE smirks.]

JODY

Um… (clears throat) Alex, anything you want to say?

ALEX

Nope.

JODY

'Kay, uh, well, um, I may have - I've…definitely seen birth control pills in your backpack.

[ALEX looks mortified.]

SAM

Oh, we're going there.

DEAN

Okay.

[CLAIRE laughs.]

ALEX

Oh my god.

JODY

Hey, if we can't talk about it we shouldn't be doing it, right?

[SAM and DEAN look awkward, a little lost for words.]

JODY

Right?

[SAM stutters.]

DEAN

What?

JODY

Okay. I'm not gonna tell you that you are too young to be having sex, or you.

ALEX

Who's she gonna have sex with, she doesn't talk to anybody.

JODY

Hey. Um, what I will tell you is that birth control pills are useless against STD's. Whoever you are with needs to suit up! Every time. Always. No pulling up the drawbridge early.

ALEX

I know I get it!

[CLAIRE laughs.]

JODY

And don't expect the guy, as much as I love Henry, to always show up packing. (To SAM and DEAN) Am I right?

[SAM looks down at his plate and takes another bite to avoid answering. Dean stares at her blankly.]

DEAN

What?

JODY

(In disbelief) Seriously?

ALEX

Stop! We haven't done anything yet. I'm just - trying to be prepared.

[A shocked JODY looks at SAM and DEAN, who are trying their best to look casual. DEAN smiles awkwardly before hiding behind his wine glass.]

JODY

Great, um, we need some more mashed potatoes, right? Mashed potatoes, I'm just gonna - (she drains her glass of wine) - I'm gonna get some more potatoes. Potatoes.

[JODY goes to the kitchen.]

DEAN

(Takes another bite) This is fun.

[CLAIRE snickers. DEAN looks at SAM, then downs more wine.]

[CUT TO AFTER DINNER.]

[DEAN helps JODY clear the dinner table, and with washing the dishes.]

DEAN

Nice ambush in there.

JODY

Hey, you guys crashed my pad first!

DEAN

Well, you know, I thought we were going to be helping you with monsters, not birth control.

JODY

Welcome to my world. I mean - don't get me wrong, I love those girls, but… man, I am hanging on by my fingertips. The last guy Claire pegged as a monster, she held a sword to his throat. He is hell-bent on pressing charges.

DEAN

You know I gotta be honest, I thought it was gonna be Alex with the adjustment issues.

JODY

Oh yeah, it was rough going there for a bit, too. But this year, everything clicked, she's dating the most popular guy in school for gosh sake.

DEAN

Yeah I know, I barely recognized her.

JODY

And but even there, I feel like I should be teaching her about boyfriends, and relationships, you know, stuff a mom would teach her.

[DEAN chuckles.]

DEAN

Sammy and I could've benefited from a little of that.

[JODY smiles knowingly.]

JODY

Yeah, but I'm not Alex's mom. I'm not Claire's mom, I didn't raise them, I don't have that kind of history with them.

[DEAN nods.]

DEAN

Well we can talk to Claire. And we'll get her to settle down.

JODY

It's not just Claire busting heads.

DEAN

There's more?

JODY

Yeah… she started college, but she hasn't been to classes for weeks. She doesn't have any friends. She spends all her time trolling for cases, and reading lore.

DEAN

Sounds kinda creepy when you put it like that.

JODY

You know I've got nothing against hunting. But if she's hiding in it, because she doesn't have anything else? I'm just - worried about her being so alone.

[DEAN nods, looking wistful.]

DEAN

Well, I'll put Sammy on it. He's better with the whole talky thing anyway.

JODY

Thanks.

DEAN

Yeah.

[INTERIOR - JODY'S HOUSE, CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT]

[CLAIRE is stretched out on her bed with her laptop open and a few lore books. There is a knock at the door.]

CLAIRE

Come in!

[SAM opens the door.]

SAM

Claire.

CLAIRE

Hey.

SAM

You, uh… you got a minute?

CLAIRE

Yeah.

[CLAIRE gets up and goes over to her dresser.]

SAM

(Referring to an assortment of missing posters pinned to her wall) Looks like you and I have the same decorating philosophy.

CLAIRE

It's not like I need the beads on my wall. I was thinking tomorrow we could go to the families of the people who disappeared, and see if there's any connection between them.

SAM

Right, um, about that. Claire - I know how it can be. The hunter life, consumes you. There is no nine to five, you start seeing monsters at every Quick-Mart in town…

CLAIRE

So you think I'm nuts?

SAM

No! Of course not. What I'm saying is - I'm not sure you have a case. And lately it seems like you've spent a lot of time hunting monsters that weren't there.

CLAIRE

What is that supposed to mean?

SAM

You wouldn't be the first hunter who is trying to escape something.

CLAIRE

And what am I escaping, exactly, aside from mind-numbing boredom?

SAM

You tell me. And how are things with Jody and Alex? And I'm not - taking sides, I'm just trying to understand what's going on.

CLAIRE

They're not trying to make me feel bad. I mean - Alex says she hate me, but, um… Sometimes I just feel like I'm a little late to the Jody and Alex show.

SAM

Yeah. Well they have been through some heavy crap together.

CLAIRE

(Nods.) Maybe it's time I just head out on my own. And be a full-fledged hunter.

SAM

Claire. I absolutely understand the need to hunt. Believe me. I do. But the monsters are always going to be there. On and on. Forever. But a chance at a family? At a home? School? That won't be.

[CLAIRE doesn't say anything, but appears to think about what he's saying.]

[EXTERIOR - MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT]

[ALEX's teacher MR. P is walking to his car in the school's parking lot, which is deserted. The lights go out, and he stops, looking around. A shadowy figure moves quickly past the frame while his back is turned. MR. P gets his keys out and goes to unlock his car, but is grabbed from behind, and rammed multiple times against the door of his car.]

[EXTERIOR - MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING]

[ALEX and HENRY walk across the street toward school.]

ALEX

(Looking at her phone and talking to Henry behind her) Come on! We're gonna be late.

HENRY

(Teasing her and tickling her) 'Come on, we're gonna be late!'

ALEX

(Laughing) I wanna catch Mr. P before the test.

[When ALEX gets closer, she realizes that all of the other students are stopped, and staring upward. ALEX and HENRY also stop, and look to see what the others are looking at. The camera tilts upward to reveal MR. P hanging from his foot at the top of the flag pole, dead. ALEX stares, horrorstruck.]

ACT TWO
[EXTERIOR, MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY]

[A FIREMAN and CORONER wheel the body off of the school's campus. JODY is there, talking to SAM and DEAN who are there in their FBI disguise.]

JODY

Victim's name is Stephen Phelps, he was a math teacher. Alex's favorite, actually.

SAM

I'm sorry to hear that.

JODY

Phelps was found hanging upside-down from the top of the flag pole, duct-taped. Like his neck had been snapped first.

DEAN

Any witnesses?

JODY

Only the lucky custodian that found him.

SAM

So, how did the killer get Phelps up there in the first place? Unless he had his own fire truck?

DEAN

Yeah, so the killer climbs up 20 feet, a guy on his back, and duct tapes him?

SAM

Yeah, and why?

JODY

(Pulling an evidence bag from her pocket) We found this around the flag pole, if it means anything. I already sent a sample to the lab.

[SAM takes the evidence bag and looks at it closely. He shakes his head, not knowing what it is.]

DEAN

What else you know about Phelps?

JODY

Just that he was a damn fine teacher. He really helped Alex out, I know that.

[CLAIRE walks up to them.]

CLAIRE

I knew it. So, what are we dealing with? Demons, ghost possession?

JODY

Claire, this is a crime scene, you can't be here.

CLAIRE

Oh, but the fake FBI can?

DEAN

(Slightly insulted) Hey!

JODY

(Hisses) Keep your voice down!

[DEAN reaches his arm out and steers CLAIRE away to talk.]

DEAN

Come here. Come here.

CLAIRE

I was trying to work the case. The case everyone said wasn't real.

DEAN

And you know what, you were right. Okay? There is something unnatural going on here. But you can't just walk up in front of a bunch of officers, and demand that the sheriff give you details on a murder investigation.

CLAIRE

Can we talk about the body now?

DEAN

Oh I'm not even near finished.

[CLAIRE rolls her eyes.]

DEAN

You need to show Jody a little respect. She did you a huge solid by taking you in. She got you set up at school -

CLAIRE

I don't wanna go to school.

DEAN

Nobody wants to go to school, Claire, it's school!

CLAIRE

Exactly!

DEAN

My point is - she's been busting her ass to get you set up with a life. She's feeding you, hell you got a nicer room than I do now. She kept you out of jail...

CLAIRE

I never asked her to.

DEAN

And that's what I'm talking about. You need to act like you give a crap! You need to appreciate what that woman's done -

[ALEX and HENRY approach them.]

ALEX

They cancelled school. So we're gonna… hang out, I guess.

DEAN

(Staring at her hard) Hang out, huh?

[DEAN stares at HENRY, not blinking, just judging him - hard.]

DEAN

Hmm.

ALEX

…Yeah. Okay then.

[ALEX and HENRY walk away.]

CLAIRE

Oh yeah. He got the message.

DEAN

Damn right he did.

CLAIRE

I'm sure.

[CLAIRE walks away. DEAN looks annoyed.]

DEAN

(In an undertone to himself) Quit walkin' away from me!

[Cut to HENRY and ALEX, who are walking away from the school, further down the block now.]

HENRY

You know the FBI?

ALEX

Jody does.

[INTERIOR - MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL, HALLWAY - DAY]

[JODY and SAM are questioning a the PRINCIPAL.]

JODY

Was there anyone that Mr. Phelps had run-ins with recently? Staff, parents, students?

PRINCIPAL

No, not that I know of. Parents would bake brownies for that man.

SAM

Well, we're gonna wanna, um, interview your staff and students, as well as have access to personnel records.

PRINCIPAL

Whatever you need. We gotta catch that bastard. Turn his insides out and string him up.

[SAM and JODY react silently to the over-the-top strangeness of the PRINCIPAL's statement.]

SAM

Glad you're on our side.

[Cut to DEAN, also inside the school, who is roaming the empty hallways and classrooms with an EMF detector.]

[Cut back to JODY and SAM, who are now in the basement, interviewing the CUSTODIAN.]

CUSTODIAN

Well, I raise the flag in the morning, and, uh, he's…he's stuck up there, you know, like a bug on a stick. I thought it was a prank at first, but uh… you know, like it was a dummy or something like that but… (laughs) It wasn't.

JODY

Did you know Mr. Phelps?

CUSTODIAN

(Shrugs) Seen him around.

SAM

Have you noticed anything weird? Or out of the ordinary going on at the school lately?

CUSTODIAN

Do you mean weirder than a dead teacher taped to the top of a flagpole, or…?

SAM

Before you discovered Mr. Phelps, had you noticed any unusual… sights, or sounds, or smells…

CUSTODIAN

Smells! (Laughs) Well, you know, this place kinda always stinks. Kids are slobs, you know? But I do the best that I can. But uh…

JODY

Mr. Wheeler, you don't seem too upset about the uh… graphic scene you came upon this morning.

CUSTODIAN

Well, what can I tell ya? I didn't know the guy.

SAM

And where were you last night? And earlier this morning before you found the body?

CUSTODIAN

(Pauses) This is confidential, right?

[SAM nods.]

CUSTODIAN

I was passed out at the Blind Donkey.

[Cut to SAM walking in the hallway of the school. DEAN catches up to him.]

DEAN

Hey! This place is bigger than it looks. Checked every classroom, every office, every hallway, and every bathroom. And I deserve hazard pay for that.

SAM

And?

DEAN

Nothing. No EMF, no hex bags, no sulfur, the only thing I found was a couple of teachers making out in the break room.

SAM

Well, you got more than I did. Not one witness. Oh, the custodian, there's definitely something up with him, he's squirrely.

DEAN

Well, teacher of the year gets run up a flag pole, and nobody knows squat? Something's going on here.

[EXTERIOR - SECLUDED, WOODED AREA BY A STREAM - DAY]

[ALEX and HENRY walk along the stream.]

HENRY

You okay? I know you were tight with Mr. Phelps.

ALEX

He thought I was super smart. Said I should ditch soccer and join the math team.

HENRY

You are super smart.

ALEX

And what he must've gone through. Nobody should die like that.

HENRY

People are messed up. Never thought we'd have an actual psychopath here in Sioux Falls.

ALEX

There are awful things out there.

HENRY

What do you mean?

ALEX

Henry… I wasn't always this girl. Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror, and I'm like - that's me?

HENRY

You said - you had to run away from home? Jody took you in?

ALEX

(Looking away) You should know… I've done some really bad things.

[Flashbacks to 9.19 Alex Annie Alexis Anne show ALEX being hauled into jail while putting up a huge fight.]

ALEX

Hurt people.

[Another flashback shows ALEX in a bar, with a creepy-looking guy who hits on her. She lures him out of the bar and back to her former house so that her former vampire family could feed on and kill him. ALEX turns her back as the vampires go at him, her face expressionless.]

ALEX

I should've told you before.

HENRY

Everybody's done stuff they're ashamed of. I mean, there was this one kid we all tortured in middle school, I-I can't even think about it.

[ALEX, her back toward him, doesn't say anything.]

HENRY

Alex! Hey. I don't care. Whatever it is you did, I don't. Okay? (He tucks her hair behind her ear.) And you never have to tell me anything if you don't want to.

[HENRY kisses her, then she hugs him.]

[INTERIOR - JODY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY]

[CLAIRE and SAM are sitting at the table, going over research about the case. JODY comes in with DEAN.]

JODY

Hey!

SAM

Yo!

DEAN

Got the results back on that fiber from crime scene.

SAM

And?

DEAN

Asbestos.

SAM

Asbestos?

DEAN

Yeah.

CLAIRE

So our killer's fire retardant. What does that mean?

DEAN

Well, not much yet.

JODY

And, Wheeler the Janitor? His alibi checks out.

SAM

Well, his social security number does not. It belongs to Mimi Garcia, who died in 1988.

CLAIRE

And Wheeler started at Marshall a few months ago. When the disappearances started. The ones I said were supernatural in the first place?

JODY

Yes, we know, you keep reminding us.

SAM

So… we need to talk to this Mr. Wheeler again.

[SAM closes his laptop and gets up.]

JODY

Okay, I'm gonna run his ID photo through the database.

[CLAIRE also gets up.]

CLAIRE

I'm coming with you. I have a Fed suit, I can be your new agent trainee.

JODY

Okay, hold on there, Quantico! You and I are leaving in a half an hour, the registrar, remember?

CLAIRE

Reschedule it.

JODY

Again? Uh-uh. You are going to beg him to let you re-enroll. Tonight.

CLAIRE

When there's a killer out there?

DEAN

Hey.

[DEAN and SAM give her a look. CLAIRE looks frustrated, but doesn't argue. She walks away. DEAN smiles at JODY as they leave.]

[INTERIOR - JODY'S GARAGE - NIGHT]

[The garage door opens and JODY and CLAIRE walk in, heading toward JODY's truck.]

CLAIRE

I feel like a total ass-hat. Who dresses like this?

JODY

You know, there is a reason why murderers put on monkey suits when they go in front of a judge.

[All of a sudden, the custodian from the high school comes up from behind JODY and hits her over the head with a shovel. JODY falls to the ground.]

CLAIRE

Jody!

[CLAIRE runs up and tries to attack the custodian, but he grabs her and pins her against the wall.]

CUSTODIAN

I always thought you were the pretty one!

[The CUSTODIAN holds her by the throat and starts choking her as his fangs descend, revealing himself to be a vampire. CLAIRE draws her knife, but the CUSTODIAN wrestles it out of her hand. He starts beating her up as JODY attacks him with a metal rod. The CUSTODIAN kicks her, breaking her leg. He then punches her in the face. He drags CLAIRE out of the garage into the night. JODY manages to find her phone.]

[EXTERIOR - OUTSIDE THE CUSTODIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT]

[SAM and DEAN are walking away from the house, toward the Impala.]

DEAN

…And a fake address. Well I am loving this guy.

[DEAN'S phone rings.]

DEAN

Hey what's up?

[CUT to JODY on the floor of the garage.]

JODY

Dean! You need -

[CUT back to DEAN, on the phone.]

DEAN

Jody?

[CUT back to JODY. The CUSTODIAN kicks her in the face, sending the phone flying.]

[CUT to DEAN, who can hear the sounds of a fight on the other end.]

DEAN

Jody!

ACT THREE
[EXTERIOR - JODY'S HOUSE, GARAGE - NIGHT]

[SAM and DEAN pull up in the Impala. The garage door is open, JODY's truck is still there, but JODY, CLAIRE, and the CUSTODIAN are nowhere to be seen.]

DEAN

(Yells) Jody? Claire?

SAM

I'll check the house.

[SAM runs off and DEAN enters the garage. DEAN finds CLAIRE's knife on the ground, along with JODY's abandoned cell phone.]

DEAN

(Yells) Dammit!

[SAM returns.]

SAM

Nothing! No one.

[DEAN shows SAM the knife.]

SAM

It's Claire's knife.

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

So whatever it was, it was lying in wait for them when they left.

[The phone rings.]

DEAN

This is Agent Noon…. no I have not seen the sheriff either. I'd be happy to pass on the information. I'm just here with my partner, what do you got? (Pauses, then looks at Sam.) They identified the custodian.

SAM

Good.

DEAN

Richard Beesome? A trucker out of O'Neill, Nebraska, he's been missing for three years. Thank you.

[DEAN hangs up.]

DEAN

His family was found exsanguinated. Throats ripped out.

SAM

He's a vampire?

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

(Thinking) O'Neill, isn't that where Alex was from? Where her nest was?

DEAN

So, what, Beesome was part of Alex's old nest? Came here looking for Alex and then found Jody and Claire instead?

SAM

I don't know, something still doesn't sit right.

DEAN

We gotta warn Alex.

SAM

Yeah, alright you pick her up, I'll go check Beesome's office, there's bound to be something there.

[DEAN leaves in the Impala, and SAM gets into JODY's truck, finding extra keys above the sun visor.]

[EXTERIOR - 50'S BURGERS DINER - NIGHT]

[ALEX is sitting outside the diner in a Jeep. DEAN calls her as HENRY gets in, and the scene flips back and forth between DEAN, driving in the Impala, and ALEX in the Jeep.]

DEAN

Hey, where are you, I'm comin' to get you.

ALEX

I'm at 50s, on Lake.

DEAN

'Kay, sit tight till I get there, do not go off by yourself.

ALEX

What's going on?

DEAN

The custodian at your school, he's a vamp.

ALEX

Oh my god. No.

DEAN

Listen to me, I'll be there 5 minutes, don't move. You understand?

ALEX

Yeah.

[ALEX hangs up.]

HENRY

Who was that?

ALEX

You need to go.

HENRY

What do you mean?

ALEX

You need to get away from me, now. Just leave me here.

[ALEX tries to leave the Jeep, when HENRY grabs her.]

HENRY

(Growling) I can't let you go.

[HENRY grabs her hair and pulls her toward him, his fangs descending.]

[INTERIOR - MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL, CUSTODIAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT]

[SAM wanders around in the dark with a flashlight, looking for anything that might help. He finds an old map of the school grounds, and looks at it.]

[EXTERIOR - 50s BURGERS DINER - NIGHT]

[DEAN pulls up in the Impala. The Jeep is no longer there. DEAN gets out and calls ALEX, and hears her phone ringing. He finds it on the ground next to a dumpster. He picks it up.]

DEAN

Oh come on!

[DEAN calls SAM, who is still looking over the map in the custodian's office, and the scene flips back and forth between them.]

SAM

Hey.

DEAN

Alex is gone.

SAM

Dean, listen, I just found an old school map, uh, there's a building, it used to be the pool. They closed it down because it had asbestos. That has to be where Beesome took them.

DEAN

I'm 15 minutes away.

SAM

Alright, it's at the East end of the school, I'm heading there now.

[SAM hangs up and rushes off.]

[INTERIOR - MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL, OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT]

[JODY and CLAIRE are tied up near a number of dead bodies. Beesome stands guard.

CLAIRE

Those are the bodies that went missing.

BEESOME

Just a little takeout. Waiting for trash day.

JODY

(To Claire) You were right. (Pauses, then looks at Beesome.) What are we here for?

[They hear the door open, and HENRY leads ALEX in. ALEX sees CLAIRE and JODY tied up.]

ALEX

No! No! What the hell is this?

BEESOME

Your whole life.

ACT FOUR
[INTERIOR - MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL, OLD POOL BUILDING - NIGHT]

[ALEX is now tied up as well, across the room from JODY and CLAIRE.]

BEESOME

How's this for a family reunion, huh? (Laughs) Would've invited my own, but uh, they died. Couple years ago. Do you know how?

[BEESOME looks at ALEX.]

BEESOME

You figured out who I am?

ALEX

I don't know you.

BEESOME

(Chuckles disbelievingly.) You don't remember? Oh. You took my life, and you don't remember? Three years ago. Nebraska. Some sleaze bag was taking you home outside of a bar, and I chased him off. Cause see, you were so young, and I could see that you didn't want anything to do with the guy, I mean I - I thought maybe some pimp was working you. I gave you a few twenties and told you I would drive you home.

ALEX

(Eyes filled with tears) I do remember you.

BEESOME

Oh. Oh good. You remember how you didn't say a word all the way there?

[A flashback shows ALEX getting out of BEESOME's car and walking away without a word. He asks, "Is this your house? Hey!"]

BEESOME (in the present)

And then they came.

[In the flashback, BEESOME gets jumped by her former vampire nest. As he yells, ALEX keeps walking further away in silence.]

BEESOME (in the present)

Whole starving pack tore into me. They drank me alive. They turned me!

[ALEX is in tears.]

JODY

Leave her alone, she had no choice!

BEESOME

That is when the real fun began, because I went home to tell my wife what happened, but see, I was covered in blood. My own blood. Which made me crazy. Starving. I lost control. I gutted her. And my boy.

ALEX

I'm so sorry. They - they made me.

BEESOME

You could have left me outside that bar. I tried to help you! I was a good man! And you know the only thing that kept me going was the knowledge that I would find you one day, and I would make you pay.

HENRY

You see Rich, he was tracking you for months, Alex. Yeah, he's been watching you.

ALEX

What for?

BEESOME

Well, I was just gonna kill you outright, but of course you're just so miserable and alone, it would've been a mercy killing.

[HENRY laughs.]

BEESOME

I wanted you to be happy first. I wanted you to have something precious, so that I could take it from you.

HENRY

So, he turned the most popular kid in school and sent me after you. I'd build you up -

BEESOME

And I would chop you right down. Piece by piece. I'd take your teacher, your boyfriend, your family, and then I'll feed you to my nest.

ALEX

(To Henry) Nothing? None of it was real?

HENRY

Seriously Al? You were a complete freak! I mean, you were an angry loner, creeping around the school like some kind of trench coat mafia?

CLAIRE

You're gonna burn in hell, you sociopath.

HENRY

(Still looking at Alex) I could never date someone like you.

[ALEX spits in his face, and BEESOME slaps her.]

JODY

(Yelling) Stop it!

[HENRY, pretends to charge at her, fangs out, to scare her, then walks away.]

BEESOME

Don't mess with this one. Henry's got a real mean streak, you know. You know this one, couldn't just kill Mr. Phelps, he had to run him up a flagpole for the whole school to salute.

HENRY

Well she saw him, didn't she?

BEESOME

You brought a lot of cops. But Henry's young. He'll learn.

[BEESOME grabs CLAIRE and drags her away from JODY.]

CLAIRE

Get off me!

JODY

They know we're here! Those FBI, they're hunters! They know that you killed Phelps, and they killed Alex's entire nest, just ask her!

ALEX

It's - it's true, they're coming for you!

BEESOME

Shut up!

CLAIRE

Ow!

[Elsewhere inside the pool building, SAM is seen entering, before it cuts back to the vampires, and ALEX, CLAIRE, and JODY.]

ALEX

Henry, the killing and running all the time, you don't want that!

HENRY

What, you did this! You did this to all of us!

[BEESOME shoves CLAIRE in front of ALEX.]

BEESOME You are gonna watch everyone you love die.

CLAIRE Check your intel, you pig! Alex hates me.

[BEESOME twists CLAIRE's arm and she gasps in pain.]

ALEX

I'll help you! Let them go, and I'll work for you! You know how good I am, I kept a whole nest alive for eight years! And - and, you can feed on me when the hunting goes dry. And it goes dry, I know.

[BEESOME appears to be thinking this over.]

BEESOME

You know I might take you up on that.

[There is a long pause, until BEESOME's fangs descend and he bites CLAIRE's neck. CLAIRE screams.]

JODY

(Screaming) NO!

[CLAIRE continues screaming. Elsewhere, SAM continues to make his way closer, armed with a machete. He can hear CLAIRE's screams, and when he finally finds them, CLAIRE is lying on the ground, neck covered in blood, apparently unconscious.]

ALEX

Sam!

[SAM turns around just as BEESOME whacks him hard with a sledgehammer. SAM falls to the ground, and the machete falls from his grasp. BEESOME goes to hit him again, but SAM rolls out of the way and he misses. SAM grabs his machete again and stands up.]

JODY

No!

[HENRY hits SAM from behind with a weapon, and SAM falls into the empty pool. DEAN is now shown to be entering the building, unbeknownst to the others. CLAIRE regains consciousness as HENRY jumps into the empty pool beside SAM and continues to hit him, over and over. BEESOME grabs SAM's dropped machete.

JODY

(Whispers) Claire!

[CLAIRE looks at JODY, who nods toward a forgotten weapon on the ground. BEESOME approaches ALEX with the machete. Meanwhile, SAM has managed to get up, and his holding his own against HENRY.]

BEESOME

(To Alex, holding the machete up to her) No one's gonna save you.

[BEESOME swings the machete, and ALEX closes her eyes, just as CLAIRE stabs him from behind with a crowbar. Stunned, but not dead, he turns around to face her. As he looks at her, DEAN chops his head off with his machete. DEAN looks at CLAIRE and sees she is covered with blood.]

DEAN

Did you drink their blood?

CLAIRE

No!

[In the pool, SAM punches HENRY in the face, and grabs him. Meanwhile, DEAN cuts ALEX free.]

JODY

Ow, Dean!

[ALEX, DEAN, and CLAIRE rush over to JODY.]

DEAN

Jody?

[DEAN helps her up, supporting her.]

JODY

Oh, it had to be the leg. I'm gonna need bionics.

DEAN

Come here.

[SAM carries HENRY out of the pool and over to the others. He lets go of him in front of ALEX.]

SAM

He's all yours now.

[ALEX just looks at HENRY.]

HENRY

I shoulda tapped that when I had the chance.

ALEX

Keep dreaming about me.

[ALEX punches HENRY in the jaw, and CLAIRE slices his head off with a machete. HENRY's body falls to the ground. Everyone looks at each other. CLAIRE looks at ALEX, who nods.]

ACT FIVE
[INTERIOR - JODY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - MORNING]

[The dining room table is set with plates of pancakes, bacon, and fruit. ALEX pours orange juice into glasses while CLAIRE is busy in the kitchen. JODY comes in on crutches.]

JODY

I thought I smelled burning bacon! You two cooked?

CLAIRE

Uh, we tried. The pancakes might be a little raw.

ALEX

We wanted to do something for you.

[JODY looks at both of them, momentarily speechless.]

JODY

Okay stop looking at me like that, I feel like Tiny Tim.

[JODY makes her way over to the table.]

ALEX

I'm sorry he hurt you. Both of you.

[CLAIRE looks at her, with a purple, puffy eye and a large scrape on her cheekbone, but she doesn't look mad.]

JODY

Hey! We're fine. We're in three whole pieces, more or less, it's okay.

ALEX

It's not okay. He almost killed you for what I did.

CLAIRE

For what those vamps did. You were a kid, you had to do whatever they said.

JODY

Alex - you were ready to give up your life for us. That's goodness. And that's what's scary about family. Gives you so much to lose.

[JODY puts her arm around ALEX. Outside, the sounds of the Impala's doors can be heard.]

[EXTERIOR - JODY'S HOUSE - DAY]

[DEAN and CLAIRE exit the house.]

CLAIRE

You don't have to worry, I know what I have. You shoulda seen Jody take out that vamp, she would have taken a bullet for me.

DEAN

Does that mean you're gonna make her life less hellish?

CLAIRE

(Smiles a little) I solemnly swear not to hunt like a dumbass. Jody said that she's gonna teach me to vet leads, and teach me how to investigate…

(long pause)

She thinks I'm gonna get myself killed.

[JODY and SAM exit the house, JODY on her crutches and SAM's arms filled with containers of food.]

SAM

You alright?

JODY

Yeah, thanks!

SAM

Dude! Got ribs! And, uh, two tubs of sauce, cause you're not touching mine.

DEAN

Yes!

JODY

Made it for dinner last night, didn't get to eat it, what with the multiple kidnappings and all.

DEAN

Yeah…

[ALEX is standing by herself next to the Impala.]

SAM

Gimme a sec.

[SAM walks over to her, and CLAIRE follows.]

SAM

Hey. You gonna be alright?

ALEX

Yeah. School on Monday.

CLAIRE

You're just gonna go take a bio quiz and pretend like you didn't almost get slaughtered?

ALEX

You're not giving up hunting, are you?

CLAIRE

Hell no.

[ALEX smiles.]

SAM

Alex. Other vamps may come for you.

ALEX

I know. And I'll be ready. And when I get my life together, I might be moving on.

CLAIRE

Alex, you don't have to leave to protect us.

ALEX

That's not why. I can't be around what you all are doing. Things you're fighting.

[DEAN and JODY make their way to the Impala.]

DEAN

You gonna be alright now that you're outnumbered again?

JODY

Ah, as long as everyone wears a condom, we'll be fine.

DEAN

(Chuckles) I want that bumper sticker.

[DEAN starts the Impala, and he and SAM drive off, leaving JODY, CLAIRE, and ALEX standing on their front lawn.

[FADE TO BLACK]
