TEASER
SALEM, OHIO
[INTERIOR – COMIC BOOK STORE – OCTOBER 29TH – NIGHT]
MAN (on TV)
Do you have unwanted gold just lying around the house collecting dust? Why not turn that gold into cash? Here at Diamond Dave’s you can have cash in your hands today! We’ll take anything you want to sell us!
WOMAN (on TV)
When Aunt Gloria passed away she left me so much jewellery, I didn’t know what to do! That’s when I called Diamond Dave’s!
MAN (on TV)
If it’s gold, it’s cash in your hands!
[The television can be heard as the camera pans around the comic book store. A poster for a Hell Hazers movie can be seen next to one for ALL SAINTS DAY.]
MAN (on TV)
You’re watching Shocker TV!
[A horror movie, ALL SAINTS DAY, is playing on the TV.]
MAN (on TV)
This week on Shocker, it’s going to be a blood bath with guts, slicing and dicing. We’ve got scream queens and killing machines. 24 hours a day, all week long.
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
Time to slice and dice.
[The TV is turned off by a man, STUART. He sets the remote on the table and opens a cardboard box and starts taking out action figures. There is a life-size replica of the Hatchet Man in the shop. STUART is startled when he takes out the action figure of Panthro from Thundercats.]
STUART
Whoa, 15 inch megascale Panthro. So handsome, so angry.
[STUART chuckles and then puts the action figure into a bag. His phone rings, startling him. It is a video call from SAMANTHA. He answers it and holds the phone up.]
STUART
Hey Sam.
SAMANTHA
Stuart, what did you do?
STUART
I, uh, nothing.
SAMANTHA
Really? Because according to Yelp and this awesome one-star review we just got, you screamed at a customer and called him a, quote, mongoloid Tribble in a robotic exoskeleton built by Tony Stark’s inbred third cousin, which is not cool and weirdly, creepily specific.
STUART
That. He said I couldn’t beat up Superman.
SAMANTHA
Okay. Again, Superman is not real.
STUART
That’s not the point.
SAMANTHA
And I have seen you get winded eating a taco.
STUART
Okay, that doesn’t matter! If I had kryptonite gloves I could beat up Superman. Anyone could. That’s science, Sam!
SAMANTHA
Look I, I like that you care, really really care about this stuff but we need every customer we can get okay? So just chill a little, please.
STUART
Yeah. Um, okay. I’m sorry Sam I’m just, I just get spun out sometimes.
SAMANTHA
I know.
STUART
Coming to Game Night?
SAMANTHA
Of course, I’ll see you there.
[STUART waves bye and disconnects the call. He picks up his keys with a Batman keychain and the bag with Panthro figure. He stops for a few seconds looking guilty but then continues out of the shop after turning off the lights. He locks the door and leaves.]
[INTERIOR – STUART’S HOUSE – NIGHT]
STUART (shouting on the phone)
Yeah, well, all I’m hearing is excuses! Okay, look, I don’t even care about traffic, okay? It has been over 30 minutes so hello! Free pizza!
[The Panthro figure is on the table. As STUART is on the phone the figure turns its head to look at him. There is a noise and STUART turns around startled. The figure is now on the floor. STUART looks confused.]
STUART
What the heck.
[STUART walks toward the figure and crouches down.]
STUART
How did you…?
[The figure begins to spin its nunchucks and attacks STUART. STUART screams.]
[TITLE CARD]
ACT ONE
[INTERIOR – BUNKER – DEAN’S ROOM]
MAN (on TV)
He must have brought them back, back from hell, again. Hell Hazers 3, it lives again. And now, back to Hatchet Man, All Saints Day. There’ll be no further interruptions.
[DEAN is lying on his bed avidly watching the TV while eating pizza. The room is full of beer cans, pizza boxes and chip packets.]
DEAN
Time to slice and dice.
[On the TV a man is mopping a corridor and then stops to steal candy out of a vending machine when his hand gets stuck. Hatchet Man comes up behind him, carrying two hatchets and wearing a gruesome half mask over his scarred face.]
MAN (on TV)
Hey, this area is closed off. I said beat it buddy.
[Hatchet Man swings the hatchet at the man’s outstretched leg. Blood splatters across the candy machine while the man screams in agony. A door opens further up the corridor and a woman appears.]
HATCHET MAN
Time to slice and dice.
[The woman screams while the camera pans back to DEAN who is enthralled. Someone knocks on the door.]
DEAN
Yo.
[SAM enters.]
SAM
Hey.
DEAN
Hey.
SAM
What you doing?
DEAN
Horror marathon on Shocker. Just made my way through the Halloweens and now I’m about to…
[DEAN looks up at SAM and stops talking. SAM looks confused.]
DEAN
Oh, wow.
SAM
What?
[DEAN touches his own cheek.]
SAM
Oh yes, I shaved.
DEAN
I mean, it’s so smooth. It’s like a dolphin’s belly.
SAM (pulling up a chair and sitting down)
Yeah, yeah. Hey uh, I wanted to check up on you. You doing okay? I mean you haven’t really come out of your room in almost a week.
DEAN
Well, since when is okay part of this job, huh? Yeah, Cas is you know, showing Jack the ropes and Dark Kaia and her spear are in the wind and we have no clue where Michael is or what he’s up to. And not that I’m complaining, but the house is full of strangers, so.
SAM
So, your plan is to just lay in here watching Hatchet Man movies? Seriously?
DEAN
All Saints Day is a classic.
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
Time to slice and dice.
SAM Oh, is it?
DEAN
What do you care, you don’t even like scary movies.
SAM
Well, yeah Dean, our life is a scary movie.
DEAN
Exactly.
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
I like it when they run.
SAM
Alright well I hate to disturb your marathon, but I think I found us a case.
DEAN
More Michael monsters?
SAM
No, killer toy.
DEAN
What kind of toy?
[SAM sets a tablet on the bed in front of DEAN. A video with STUART with cuts on his face plays with the title: THEY LIVE: Killer Toys! True Story!]
STUART (in video)
…and then the thing freaking jumped me! I mean, it wouldn’t stop. It was over and over…
[STUART mimes nunchucks, DEAN looks bemused.]
STUART (in video)
Panthro kicked my ass.
DEAN
Thundercats? Seriously?
SAM
Yeah. But I mean, you’ve got your pizza, at least eight more of these movies so I’ll just leave you to it and I’ll get one of the other guys…
DEAN (getting up off the bed)
Oh, hell no, hell no. No, Panthro, that’s mine.
[EXTERIOR – ROAD – DAY]
[IMPALA drives down the road.]
[EXTERIOR – COMIC BOOK STORE – DAY]
[SAM and DEAN are walking to the door of the comic shop.]
DEAN
What if we’re talking like, one toy gone bad or it’s like a whole crew, you know? Like public master style.
SAM
Do you actually want there to be more than one?
DEAN
I don’t know.
[Some children dressed in costumes yell "Boo" at the boys as they pass them. SAM looks disconcerted.]
DEAN
Still not a fan of Halloween, huh?
SAM
Nope.
DEAN (chuckling)
It’s so lame.
[SAM and DEAN enter the comic book store. All Saints Day is playing on the TV. DEAN helps himself to a lollipop from a jar on a table in front of the TV.]
SAMANTHA
Hey, I can help you guys in just a second.
DEAN
Hm, she’s like your twin.
[SAM pushes his hair back just as SAMANTHA does the same.]
SAM
What? What are you talking about?
DEAN
Soft, delicate features, luxurious hair. She’s like your wonder twin.
SAM
Yeah.
[A man, DIRK, is crouching in front of the comic book stands picking up comics. He has a lollipop in his mouth. SAM points to him.]
SAM
Well, okay, if that’s me then that’s you over there.
DEAN
That guy?
SAM
Yeah.
DEAN
Yeah, we have zero in common. Whoa, Hatchet Man. No way, Sam check it out. It’s David freaking Yaeger.
[DEAN walks over to the figure of HATCHET MAN.]
SAM
Yeah.
DIRK
Press the button.
[DEAN presses the button on the figure of HATCHET MAN.]
HATCHET MAN FIGURE
Time to slice and dice.
DEAN
Oh dude!
[DEAN presses the button again.]
HATCHET MAN FIGURE
We all do bad things sometimes.
[DEAN presses it again.]
HATCHET MAN FIGURE
Trick or treat.
SAM
Hey hey hey hey hey dude.
DEAN
I need this, how much?
DIRK
Not for sale, Hatchet Man’s a classic.
[DEAN smiles and agrees and continues to look at the figure.]
SAM
Yeah, nothing in common.
SAMANTHA
Okay, what can I help you guys with? Funko Pops, magic cards?
SAM
Uh Stuart Blake…
DEAN
Vintage Hot Wheels.
SAMANTHA
I’m sorry, were you getting helped by Stuart with vintage Hot Wheels or…?
SAM
No, sorry. My name is Ian Gillan and this is uh…
DEAN
I’m Ritchie Blackmoore. We’re with Campbell and Sons Insurance. We heard about Stuart’s little incident with the toy and we’re hoping to speak with him.
SAMANTHA
Oh he’s at home, healing up.
SAM
Well, we went to his place and his roommate said he had moved out.
DEAN
Kicked out, actually.
SAMANTHA
Right, they had a fight.
SAM
Over?
SAMANTHA
Fist of the North Star. Stuart said that the dubbed version was better but you know what, forget it. Um, I like Stuart, but he’s an acquired taste.
DEAN
Sounds like a guy who could make a lot of enemies.
SAMANTHA
I mean, not real ones. Maybe online, he trolls everything.
SAM
Okay, where can we find Stuart now?
SAMANTHA
He’s at his mom’s house.
DEAN
Of course he is.
SAM
Thanks.
[INTERIOR – BARBRA’S HOUSE – DAY]
[SAM and DEAN are sitting at the dining table. BARBRA places two superhero mugs in front of them.]
BARBRA
Stewie will be up in just a minute.
SAM
Thanks.
[DEAN switches the cups so he can drink out the Flash one.]
SAM
I can’t believe you had her make us apple cider.
DEAN
She offered.
STUART (voice, yelling)
No no! You stupid, dumb, that’s not how you play the… argh! Game over, I’m done! Done!
[STUART comes up the stairs in pyjamas and with headphones on. He takes them off when he sees SAM and DEAN. His face has wounds from the toy attack.
STUART
Who’re you?
SAM
We’re from Campbell and Sons Insurance and…
DEAN
What are you doing down there?
STUART
Fortnite.
SAM (to DEAN)
It’s a video game.
STUART
It’s the video game.
DEAN Yeah, well I’m a Zelda for life so. What are you, burning sage down there?
STUART
So? I dated this Goth chick, like super-hot, met online and she was into Wicca. She said that burning sage was like good luck or some crap like that.
SAM
Hm, so you’re not together anymore?
STUART
Ha, no. I broke it off before we could MIRL. You know, I mean, who need goth girl drama am I right?
DEAN
Mirl?
SAM
MIRL – Meet in real life.
DEAN
Why do you know what that means?
SAM
Stuart, we’re here to ask about the attack you reported, with the toy?
STUART
I made it up.
DEAN
You what?
STUART
The whole thing, I lied.
SAM
But, the video…
STUART
That was fake. I didn’t expect it to go viral, but it did and uh I just, I fell.
DEAN
Hm, because the hospital report said that you had mark on your face, your legs, your back and your genitals. That’s not a slip and fall.
STUART
Well I don’t see why an insurance company would care, you know. And I think it’s time for you to leave.
SAM
Okay, but.
STUART
Now.
[EXTERIOR – BARBRA’S HOUSE – DAY]
[The door slams in SAM and DEAN’s face, they both walk towards the Impala.]
DEAN
Wow, lady, you wasn’t kidding. That guy is a piece of work.
SAM
Well, whatever happened was not an accident.
DEAN
Okay, but Big Bang in there, not a great liar.
SAM
No. So what are we thinking, a spell?
DEAN
No, his girlfriend was into Wicca.
SAM
Wicca doesn’t always mean witch.
DEAN
Except when it does.
SAM
Alright, let’s wait till they leave. Check out the house for hex bags.
DEAN
Deal.
[EXTERIOR – BARBRA’S HOUSE – DAY]
[Kids in Halloween costumes are walking around. SAM and DEAN are in the Impala, staking out the house. SAM is on the phone.]
SAM
Yeah, find some lamb’s blood. Right. Exactly. Alright good, stay safe.
DEAN
All good?
SAM
Yeah, it was Riley. He’ll be fine.
DEAN
I don’t know who Riley is, but cool. So seriously, what is your deal with Halloween?
SAM
I don’t like it.
DEAN
Yeah, but why don’t you like it, hm? And don’t give me that like, ‘well every day is Halloween for us’ crap, okay? Because one: it ain’t, we don’t eat that much candy, two: you’ve had this hate on for years. So?
SAM
Mom’s on the move.
[BARBRA is leaving the house dressed in costume. She gets into the car and drives away. SAM and DEAN lay back so she doesn’t see them as they pass the Impala.]
DEAN
Alright what about our guy?
SAM
You know I think I know why Stuart changed his story; the comments on his video are all pretty brutal. People are calling him a liar, a loser, Thunderspaz, Snarf’s lovechild, Panthro’s B….
DEAN
Rhymes with itch?
SAM
Yeah.
DEAN
Gotta love the internet, where everyone can be a dick.
STUART
Help me!
[STUART is standing at the door to his house, covered in blood and clutching his stomach. SAM and DEAN run out of the car towards him.]
STUART
Help me! Help!
DEAN
Stay with him.
SAM
Yeah. Okay, hey hey hey, we’re going to get you help.
[INTERIOR – BARBRA’S HOUSE – DAY]
[DEAN has his gun extended and is searching the house. There is a bloody handprint and drops of blood in STUART’S room. DEAN walks into the room, he stops in front of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre poster. There is the sound of a chainsaw and DEAN turns around. A floating chainsaw flies at him and DEAN dodges while the chainsaw sticks in the poster.]
ACT TWO
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL ROOM – NIGHT]
[STUART is unconscious in a hospital bed with his mother sitting next to him. SAM and DEAN are standing in front of the bed.]
BARBRA
My poor baby.
DEAN
Yeah it was touch and go there for a while, but doctors say he’s going to be alright.
BARBRA
I’m just grateful you showed up. I… Thank you, you saved his life. Oh, I should run back home, get Stewie his favourite pillow.
DEAN
Actually, you know what, uh… It’s probably better if you just stay here.
SAM
Yeah, just until he wakes up you know.
BARBRA
Yeah, of course. You’re right. I’m just all flustered.
DEAN
It’s okay. Everything’s fine.
[SAM and DEAN leave the room and walk into the corridor.]
DEAN
Everything is not fine.
SAM
Yeah, my first clue is a flying chainsaw.
DEAN
While you were waiting for the ambulance, I did a quick sweep for hex bags. Nothing, but then I pulled out the EMF, went freaking crazy.
SAM
So it’s a ghost.
DEAN
Yeah. Hey, we’ve got to figure out a way to keep Mom here while we clear the house.
SAM
Well, I don’t get why a ghost would be gunning for Stuart.
DEAN
Murder, grave robbery, stole his favourite Pokemon, I mean, take your pick.
SAM
Yeah. Alright you stay here with them, I’ll go check the house, ask around, see if anybody…
DEAN
Got dead lately.
SAM
Yeah.
DEAN
Alright.
[DEAN throws his keys at SAM who takes them and leaves. DEAN returns to the hospital room.]
[INTERIOR – BARBRA’S HOUSE – NIGHT]
[The bloody chainsaw is still stuck in the poster on the wall. SAM enters the room, the lights aren’t working. He pulls out a flashlight and looks through the room. He sees the action figure of Panthro and starts. He laughs at himself.]
SAM
Nice, Sam. Smooth.
[SAM takes out his EMF meter and checks for disturbance near the action figure. There is no response.]
SAM
What the hell?
[He turns around confused. He sees the wallpaper on Stuart’s computer and sees it’s a picture of STUART, SAMANTHA, DIRK, and JORDAN.]
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL ROOM – NIGHT]
[DIRK is standing outside the room, looking in at STUART. Shocker Television is playing. DEAN walks up to DIRK holding candy bars.]
DEAN
Hey.
DIRK
Hey, what are you doing here?
DEAN
Just keeping an eye on Stuart.
DIRK
He must have awesome insurance.
DEAN
Super awesome. Trick or treat?
[DEAN gives DIRK a candy bar.]
DEAN
He’s still out.
DIRK
Yeah the nurse told me. Babs went out for a quick bite. Can I stick around, I want to be here when he wakes up. He’s kind of my best friend.
DEAN
Is that right?
DIRK
Look I, I know Stuart has his stuff but we all do and me and my dad don’t get along so great and when we really have it out, Stuart lets me crash at his place, no questions asked. We just eat pizza and watch movies. It’s zen.
DEAN
Sounds like a good friend.
DIRK
Yeah but now? When his mom called, said someone had attacked him with a chainsaw?
DEAN
Looks like, but happy Halloween, huh?
[There is a scream on the TV, ALL SAINTS DAY is playing. DEAN and DIRK watch. On the TV a woman enters a morgue with bodies covered by bloody sheets. She looks scared.]
WOMAN (on TV)
Okay, yeah yeah.
DIRK
Cool! All Saints Day 3.
DIRK and DEAN
Time to slice and dice!
WOMAN (on TV)
…like creeping me out to the max.
[On TV the HATCHET MAN comes up behind the woman and she screams and falls down.]
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
Trick or treat. Time to slice and dice.
DEAN
Never gets old.
DIRK
You know, a lot of people don’t like this one, but it’s actually my favourite. I mean, sure, there’s no way a hospital would ever be that empty, but that’s overthinking it.
DEAN
I don’t know, been to a lot of hospitals at night. Trust me, they get pretty empty.
DIRK
Okay so, All Saints Day 3, that’s my top pick. What about you?
DEAN
I mean I like 5 right, Search for David Yaeger? Because it’s weird but it’s bloody.
DIRK
So bloody!
DEAN
Yeah.
DIRK
In the best way.
DEAN
But uh… I’ve got to go with number 4.
DIRK
Hatchet Man Lives? Nice choice!
DEAN
Yeah.
DIRK
“Killed in a prank gone wrong…”
DIRK and DEAN
“… mechanic David Yaeger comes back every year on the day after Halloween. On All Saints Day Hatchet Man takes his revenge.”
DIRK
You really know your ASD.
DEAN
Ah well, growing up it was a… it was always nice to check out once in a while. I like to watch movies where I know the bad guy is going to lose.
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
Knock knock, time to die.
[INTERIOR – COMIC BOOK STORE – NIGHT]
[SAMANTHA is working late at the store. She is standing at the counter with her laptop open. Stuart’s keys are on the table. SAM enters the store.]
SAMANTHA
Oh um, we’re um, we’re closing.
SAM
Right, I just uh, I’m just here to… Did you hear about Stuart?
SAMANTHA
Yeah, his mom told us what happened when she dropped off his keys. I mean what happened to him, that’s insane.
SAM
Yeah, yeah so I actually have a few questions? Um, and they might be a little different.
SAMANTHA
Different, like?
SAM
Different, like uh, has anyone close to Stuart died recently?
SAMANTHA
You’re an insurance dude, right?
SAM
Yeah, yeah and we wouldn’t normally ask these kinds of questions, but it’s a special circumstance and…
SAMANTHA
Well, I mean, Jordan.
SAM
Jordan?
SAMANTHA
Yeah, he owned the store. He taught Stuart, Dirk and I everything we know about comics and games. He was like our own personal Willy Wonka.
SAM
Huh. Sounds like a great guy.
SAMANTHA
He was. Cancer sucks, you know.
SAM
Yeah. So, who owns the place now?
SAMANTHA
Me and Dirk. Jordan left it to us.
SAM
But not Stuart?
SAMANTHA
Stuart worked here but Jordan fired him, twice. He kept catching Stuart stealing, and to Jordan, this place was his life you know.
SAM
And you hired Stuart back?
SAMANTHA
He’s my friend.
SAM
Okay. Where is Jordan buried?
SAMANTHA
Nowhere, he was cremated.
[SAM notices the glass case behind SAMANTHA to frost up. He takes out his EMF meter.]
SAM
Oh um, right, sure. Excuse me; I just have to uh…
SAMANTHA
What’s that?
[The EMF flares up.]
SAM
Nothing, it’s a, uh, a carbon monoxide detector.
SAMANTHA
What, is that, is that bad?
SAM
Yeah, yup, pretty bad. You know what, you should leave. Now.
SAMANTHA
What, no.
SAM
Okay listen to me, this is weird but I think you’re in danger…
[SAMANTHA looks afraid. SAM turns around and the life size figure of Hatchet Man hits him across the face. SAM hits the shelves and is knocked unconscious. HATCHET MAN FIGURE turns towards SAMANTHA and she screams.]
ACT THREE
[INTERIOR – COMIC BOOK STORE – NIGHT]
[SAM wakes up and looks around.]
SAM
Samantha? Samantha!
[SAMANTHA is behind the desk, crying. SAM goes to her.]
SAM
Hey, hey. Are you okay?
SAMANTHA
No? What just happened?
SAM
I think uh, I think a ghost…
SAMANTHA
A ghost?
SAM
Yes, um. Alright, listen to me, ghosts are real and they can possess things, people, toys, chainsaws, and apparently life size figurines.
SAMANTHA
You are not from an insurance company, are you?
SAM
Not exactly. Listen, I’m not sure but I think the ghost of Jordan is trying to kill Stuart.
SAMANTHA
Wait, what?
SAM
Did he hurt you?
SAMANTHA
No, he just shoved me out of the way and then he bolted.
[SAM tries to open the door of the shop to leave.]
SAM
It’s locked. Where are the keys?
SAMANTHA
Uh, Hatchet Man or whatever took them.
SAM
You sure?
SAMANTHA
I mean, I was pretty busy screaming but yeah I’m sure.
[SAM picks up a Cthulhu figure from the table and looks at it.]
SAM
Is this expensive?
SAMANTHA
What? No, don’t!
[SAM throws the figure at the window. It bounces back.]
SAMANTHA
Yeah, it’s shatterproof glass. Jordan was pretty serious about thieves.
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL ROOM – NIGHT]
[DEAN and DIRK are on either side of the STUART’S hospital bed, eating snacks. ALL SAINTS DAY is playing on the TV.]
DEAN
The aerobics instructor in the giant mixer. Right? And the kids the next morning at the rec centre are all eating breakfast and then one finds a tooth with all the stringy bits still hooked into it. Oh come on! I mean forget Freddy and Jason, that’s top ten horror movie kill right there!
DIRK
Top five even!
DEAN
Oh and then the jock guy’s face when Hatchet Man shoves it into the engine fan of that truck and it just like… (mimes noises and the explosion).
DIRK (laughing)
Did you know that they made the brain splatter with salt water taffy?
DEAN
I did not know that. That’s pretty cool. Excuse me.
[DEAN’S phone starts ringing. He walks away and answers it.]
DEAN
Yeah, what’s up Sam?
SAM (in the comic store)
We were right, it’s a ghost. The guy’s name is Jordan MacNeal, he used to own the comic shop.
DEAN
Alright, so we’re going to a graveyard or what?
SAM
No no no, he was cremated and um…
DEAN
And what?
SAM
So he possessed the David Yaeger figure at the shop and I think he’s coming for Stuart.
DEAN
Wait wait wait wait, are you telling me that Hatchet Man, David Yaeger, is coming here?
SAM
Uh, I mean, not literally but…
DEAN (gleefully)
Hatchet Man is coming here!
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
Trick or treat.
[EXTERIOR – SUBURB – NIGHT]
[Possessed HATCHET MAN FIGURE is walking along the street carrying his hatchets and STUART’S keys. People are walking around in costumes. Across the street a man dressed as Hatchet Man notices the figure.]
MAN
Hey look at that! Hey man! Woo! David Yaeger! Killer costume.
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL ROOM – NIGHT]
[DEAN is making a salt circle around STUART’S bed.]
DIRK
If ghosts are real does that mean vampires?
DEAN
Yup.
DIRK
Witches?
DEAN
Uh-huh.
DIRK
Werewolves?
DEAN
Unless it’s Godzilla, it’s real. Alright get in.
DIRK
But…
DEAN
Now! Listen to me, ghosts can’t cross a salt line okay? So whatever you hear, whatever you see, whatever happens, stay inside. Capiche?
[DIRK sits on STUART’S bed. He nods.]
[INTERIOR – COMIC BOOK STORE – NIGHT]
[SAM is trying to pick the lock on the door.]
SAM
What I don’t get is why is Jordan going after Stuart now? It doesn’t make any sense.
SAMANTHA
Stuart’s been stealing.
SAM
What?
SAMANTHA
I mean, not cash, just stuff that he thought was cool. Stuart doesn’t have good impulse control. I’ve been taking money out of his checks to make up for it, but I guess a ghost wouldn’t know that.
SAM
Yeah, I guess not. Oh come on!
[SAM holds up a broken lock pick.]
SAM
Damn it.
SAMANTHA
Yeah, it’s a hard-core lock.
SAM
Alright, we’ve got to get out of here.
SAMANTHA
Okay, how?
SAM
Do you have cleaning supplies?
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL – NIGHT]
[DIRK is sitting on STUART’S hospital bed while STUART is still unconscious. Suddenly, it gets very cold and DIRK’S breath starts to fog.]
DIRK
What the…?
[The lights start flashing, the TV turns on and the cupboard starts banging. The whole room begins to shake.]
DIRK
No! Somebody help me! I’ve got to get out of here!
[DIRK runs out of the room.]
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL CORRIDOR – NIGHT]
[DEAN grabs a hatchet from an emergency cabinet.]
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL CAFETERIA – NIGHT]
[BARBRA is carrying a tray of food and walking. JORDAN in the HATCHET MAN FIGURE appears in front of her. She drops the tray and screams. DIRK runs up behind JORDAN.]
DIRK
Hey! Jordan, I know you’re trying to kill Stuart but he’s my friend! He’s our friend! So if you want to do this, you’ll have to go through me.
[JORDAN has turned around and starts walking towards DIRK. BARBRA runs away.]
DIRK
Crap.
[DIRK turns and runs with JORDAN in pursuit.]
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL SECURITY OFFICE – NIGHT]
[Two guards are watching ALL SAINTS DAY and sharing a bowl of popcorn. On the TV a woman sees Hatchet Man and screams.]
GUARD 1
Ooh run, run girl.
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
I like it when they run.
GUARD 2
Did you see that? You see that, that’s my favourite part.
[On the security cameras DIRK can be seen running frantically through the corridors, followed by JORDAN. He passes the security office but the guards are oblivious. The scene parallels the one playing on the TV.]
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
Enough talking, more killing.
GUARD 2
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Right?
GUARD 1
Ooh, it’s bad.
GUARD 2
She’s so slow.
WOMAN (on TV)
Somebody please help me! Where is everybody?
GUARD 2
Ooh, run girl run! You’ve got to run girl, come on now. Don’t let grandma run faster than you!
[DIRK is still shown on the security monitors running through the hospital.]
DIRK
Help! Somebody! Anybody help me! Where is everybody?
[DIRK and the woman on TV both run toward the elevator with HATCHET MAN following.]
DIRK
Oh god, oh god, Jordan please! You’re dead!
WOMAN (on TV)
Get away from me! We killed you, you’re dead!
[The elevator opens.]
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
We all do bad things sometimes.
GUARD 2
Press that button, press that button. He could never catch me, I’ll tell you that much.
[The guards still haven’t noticed DIRK running on the security cameras. DIRK enters the lift and so does the woman on TV. Both frantically push the button.]
WOMAN (on TV)
No, this can’t be happening.
DIRK
No, no.
HATCHET MAN (on TV)
You can’t run from Hatchet Man.
WOMAN (on TV)
This isn’t…
DIRK
…real!

[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL MORGUE – NIGHT]
[DEAN is carrying a hatchet and faces JORDAN.]

Alright look man, I know once you go Caspar, things can get a little, well a lot, crazy. The way I see it you’ve got two options: one, you let this go and you walk into the light or two, I send you there.

Time to slice and dice.

I was kind of hoping you would say that.

Problem is the ghost is always tied to an object right, its bones, something that meant a lot to it in life, whatever that thing is the ghost is usually stuck there but Jordan, he’s been all over, the shop, Stuart’s house, so how is he moving around?
SAMANTHA
The keychain!
SAM
What?
SAMANTHA
It was Jordan’s and then Stuart closed up the night he got attacked and he brought the shop keys home and then his mom brought them back after. I mean, could that, does that make sense?

Yeah, it does. Come on.

Dean, keychain!

SAMANTHA
Here, here use this.

Hurry up!

[INTERIOR – IMPALA – NIGHT]
DEAN
Thanks man. You uh, you got me out here because you needed to get me out of my funk and give me a win and you did. So, thanks.
SAM
I’ve got to admit it didn’t go exactly like I thought it would.
DEAN
Hey man, I just went toe-to-toe with David freaking Yaeger. That was awesome!
SAM
Yeah, it wasn’t really…
DEAN
Don’t ruin this for me.
SAM
Hey Dean, when we get back to the bunker, man you’ve got to stop hiding out in your room.
DEAN
I’m not hiding out.
SAM
And I get why you’re doing it, I do but what happened with Michael… You said yes for me, for Jack, for your family. You did the right thing. What happened after, just because Michael was wearing your face doesn’t mean any of this is on you. I don’t blame you, no one blames you. You’ve got to try and stop blaming yourself. Please.
DEAN
I’m never going to get over it, okay? I’m just not. But you’re right; I’m not doing anybody any good by just staying cooped up in my room so, whatever you need. I’m there. Alright Chief.
[SAM smiles. DEAN’S watch beeps.]
DEAN
Alright well that is it, Halloween is officially over.
SAM
Good.

Okay seriously, why? Why do you hate Halloween? What is it, was it the time I, I ate all your Halloween candy?

No.
DEAN
Was it something that Dad did?
SAM
No dude, you don’t want to know.
DEAN
No I really do, really. What?
SAM
Alright, you remember Andrea Howell?
DEAN
…no?
SAM
When I was in sixth grade we were living in Bismarck and I had a huge crush on her.
DEAN
Aw, that’s adorable. Continue.
SAM
So, she invited me to her Halloween party. I said yes and I went over and at first everything was great, um, and then we started to play games.
DEAN
Spin the bottle.
SAM
Bobbing for apples. Like I said, I had a crush so the entire night my stomach was in knots and when it was my turn I bent down and…
DEAN
No.
SAM
…hurled, everywhere. Lunch, dinner it all came up, on Andrea mostly. People ran and screamed and it was so bad.
DEAN
Ah that’s great.
SAM
I ended up hiding out in the woods till you finally came and got me.
DEAN
So that’s why you hate Halloween.
SAM
Yeah.
DEAN
Oh come on man you’ve got to deal with that, that’s I mean… Alright this is what we’re going to do, next year we’re doing Halloween right okay? I’m thinking matching outfits like uh, Batman and Robin.
SAM
No.
DEAN
Bert and Ernie.
SAM
No.
DEAN
That’s weird.
SAM
Yes.
DEAN
Uh, Rocky Bullwinkle.
SAM
Dean…
DEAN
