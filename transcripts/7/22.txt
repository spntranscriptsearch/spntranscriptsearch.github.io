NOW
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO – DAY


A hand in front of the camera is counting down. A woman wearing a suit sits in a chair facing the camera.


VOICE-OVER
…Business Watch, with our own Gloria Jane.


GLORIA
Thanks, Phil. And now we turn our attention to agriculture, where an unlikely personality has now come on to the scene in a major way.


We see several video camera views of the scene: GLORIA facing the camera, GLORIA and DICK ROMAN sitting opposite each other, and DICK ROMAN facing the camera.


GLORIA
Richard Roman, a CEO whose company dominates the defense and aviation sectors, not to mention being a giant in the motivational-speaking world.


DICK ROMAN
What can I say, Gloria? I'm a multitasker.


GLORIA
Clearly. And now you've recently purchased controlling stock in Sucrocorp – among the world's leading manufacturers in high-fructose corn syrup. It's a pleasure to have you with us, Richard.


DICK ROMAN
Please. "Dick."


GLORIA
So, tell us, Dick, why the recent fascination with big foods?


DICK ROMAN
Well, it's no secret we all love to eat, but now Sucrocorp will focus on eating well.


GLORIA
Help me connect the dots. How will pumping sweeteners into our system make us healthier?


DICK ROMAN
One word – purity. We're dialing back the additives to deliver the highest quality all-American product you people deserve. America is for go-getters, folks who get off their butts and make it happen. And we need you just as healthy as you can be. Which is why we are diving whole hog into what keeps Americans living longer... and tasting better.


[While DICK ROMAN speaks, we see:

An overweight man dressed in shorts and a singlet, sitting on a sofa eating snack food from a bag while watching television
A man in a convenience store slowly chewing a sugar-coated pastry while watching the DICK ROMAN interview on the store’s television
A group of men watching the interview on television.]

GLORIA
You do, of course, mean to say the food will be tasting better.


DICK ROMAN
That's exactly what I mean.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)

ACT ONE
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO – DAY


GLORIA is looking at the video screens with a producer.


GLORIA
Yeah, very good.


DICK ROMAN hands his microphone to an assistant. SUSAN walks up to DICK ROMAN and puts a briefcase on the desk in front of him.


SUSAN
Your 11 a.m. is waiting in the conference room.


DICK ROMAN
Thank you, Susan.


DICK ROMAN opens the briefcase and takes out The Word of God. SUSAN smiles slightly and turns away.


DICK ROMAN
Susan... Are we still looking for a rep in mainstream media?


SUSAN
Yes, we are.


DICK ROMAN
Wunderbar. Put a replace order on Gloria there.


SUSAN
And with the corpse?


DICK ROMAN
Call Chef Fieri. I feel like barbecue.


INT. OFFICE – DAY


EDGAR is seated at a table opposite someone. DICK ROMAN enters.


DICK ROMAN
Kevin. Dick. I'm very excited to meet you.


KEVIN, with his mouth taped shut and his hands tied behind his back, is seated across the table from EDGAR.


DICK ROMAN
You nervous? Don't be. I'm your biggest fan. [He rips the tape off KEVIN’s mouth.] I brought you a present. [He opens his briefcase and takes out the Word of God.] What's that say, Kev?


KEVIN
I don't know.


DICK ROMAN
Cute. Edgar?


EDGAR takes out a knife and walks over to KEVIN. KEVIN whimpers.


DICK ROMAN
Easy, Edgar. Don't scare the boy.


EDGAR cuts the binding on KEVIN’s hands.


DICK ROMAN
You know, I've checked, Kevin. Number one in your class, winner of the Chad Kennedy top young scientist prize – all that on top of being Keeper of the Word. You're a clever young man. [He takes a laptop out of his briefcase, opens it and slides it towards KEVIN.] I'm confident you'll make the right choice here. But I see this is a negotiation. [He takes an envelope out of his briefcase.] Well, I will sweeten... the pot.


KEVIN
What is it?


KEVIN picks up the envelope and opens it.


DICK ROMAN
My sources tell me you're applying to Princeton. Letter of recommendation like that from a man like me – done.


KEVIN
I can't do it.


DICK ROMAN
I admire your gumption, kid. But I still think there's some wiggle room here. I tell you what – let's kick it up a notch. See if I can't change your mind. Edgar, that live feed up yet?


EDGAR
’Course.


EDGAR hits a button on a remote and footage of someone holding a knife to MRS TRAN’s throat appears on a large screen.


KEVIN
Ma? Mom?!


DICK ROMAN
Well, I think this negotiation is concluded.


KEVIN whimpers in distress.


DICK ROMAN
You drive a hard bargain, kid.


EXT. RUFUS’ CABIN – DAY


A red car is parked outside.


INT. RUFUS’ CABIN – DAY


SAM is typing on his laptop at the table. DEAN is sitting on the sofa reading the notebook in which KEVIN translated the Word of God.


DEAN
Okay, man, I have read this more times than the Playboy I found in Dad's duffel.


SAM
Anna Nicole?


DEAN
Anna Nicole. Oh, the good – they die young, huh?


SAM exhales and smiles/grimaces.


DEAN
Look, we can read this till our eyes bleed. It ain't getting any clearer.


SAM
Okay. Then what does it mean?


DEAN
Uh… Cut off the head, and the body will flounder.


SAM
Yeah.


DEAN
Okay. Well, I think we both agree that, uh, the head is Dick. Right?


SAM
Right.


DEAN
So, bottom line is, we go grab the stuff, and we mix ourselves a weapon. End of story. [He takes a drink from a beer bottle.]


SAM
Look, I'm all for killing Dick. I'm just saying, what then? I mean, what about the rest of the Leviathan? What, are they gonna just... drop dead?


DEAN
I don't know. Maybe.


SAM
Maybe? "Maybe" is good enough for you right now?


DEAN
One problem at a time, all right?


SAM
Okay. But it's not a crazy idea to try and figure out what the catch is before we go crashing the gate.


DEAN
Maybe this is the catch. God's not telling us every detail. You know? The word is from God. I don't know how much better it's gonna get.


BOBBY is standing behind the sofa.


CUT TO: DEAN brushing his teeth in the bathroom. As he spits into the sink, the mirror above him mists over. When DEAN exhales, his breath is visible. He turns around.


DEAN
Hey, Bobby. How you feeling?


BOBBY
Stronger than ever. Now, while you two have been chasing your tails, I've been thinking on that weapon.


DEAN
Wait a second. Don't you think you should be saving your strength?


BOBBY
For what?


DEAN
I'm just saying you might want to slow down. You don't look so hot.


BOBBY
I'm in the Veil. My Brad Pitt days are over. Now, the kid says that the only way to kill Leviathan is with a bone washed in the three bloods of the fallen. It's got to be from a human as light and good as the Leviathan are hungry and dark.


DEAN
Yeah. Good luck with that.


BOBBY
The rest is doable, and doable now. You've already got the fallen angel blood. Now, next up is blood from the ruler of fallen humanity. Now, the best I can tell, that's Crowley. Numero tres is the father of fallen beasts.


DEAN
Which means...?


BOBBY
You got to bleed an Alpha.


DEAN
But they're all dead. I mean, every one we found, we rounded up for Crowley, and then Cas whammied them all.


BOBBY
Well, then, make this Cas' problem, too.


DEAN
Cas ain't exactly in the problem-solving mode, Bobby.


BOBBY
Then Crowley!


DEAN
All right, I get it. I get it.


BOBBY
Do you?!


The mirror behind DEAN cracks.


BOBBY
I'm just sayin'. I have faith that you boys will figure it out. Relax. I'm fine. Just got a little carried away.


CUT TO: SAM watching a Sucrocorp video on his laptop.


VOICE-OVER
Here at Sucrocorp, your well-being is our number-one priority.


DEAN pours himself a whiskey.


VOICE-OVER
Sucrocorp – eat well, live well.


DEAN
Little FYI. Bobby's officing out of the john these days.


SAM
Uh... awkward.


DEAN sits down at the table opposite SAM.


DEAN
Yeah, you're telling me. Uh, he does have some ideas about the weapon, though.


SAM
Really? Well, uh, he may be just in time.


SAM turns the laptop around to show DEAN an article titled “Roman Acquires Sucrocorp.”


DEAN
"Roman acquires..." What's Sucrocorp?


SAM
They make food additives, namely high-fructose corn syrup. That crap is in – well, it's in just about everything – um, soda, sauces, bread.


DEAN
Don't say "pie."


SAM
Definitely pie.


DEAN
Bastards. So now what? Roman's moved past restaurants?


SAM
And into grocery stores, Gas n' Sips, vending machines.


DEAN
What can we do about it?


SAM
Short of going Al Qaeda on their trucks and plants, there's nothing we can do about it.


The laptop closes and SAM and DEAN jump.


DEAN
Like I said, uh, Bobby's got some ideas.


CUT TO: DEAN putting a bowl down on a table that is set up with chalk symbols, a bottle of blood and candles. He slices his hand with a pocketknife and drips his blood into the bowl.


SAM
Et ad congregandum eos coram me.


SAM lights a match and tosses it into the bowl. Flames rise up from the bowl and CROWLEY appears.


CROWLEY
Hello, boys.


INT. OFFICE – DAY


KEVIN is typing on the laptop, next to which are the Word of God and DICK ROMAN’s recommendation letter. DICK ROMAN stands behind him.


DICK ROMAN
That's some bracing prose you're putting down there, Kevin. You all done?


KEVIN
[nods] Um-hmm.


DICK ROMAN
You've done well. Princeton will be lucky to have you.


KEVIN
What about my mom?


DICK ROMAN
[to EDGAR] Make the call.


EDGAR takes out his phone and makes a call.


EDGAR
Release her. But stress the consequences of talking.


DICK ROMAN
Kevin, I'm gonna request the pleasure of your company a tad longer. [to EDGAR] You, on the other hand, I need to drop in on an old friend.


INT. RUFUS’ CABIN – DAY


CROWLEY
So, that's what all the "rumble, rumble" was about. Who translated it for you?


DEAN
Never mind. You gonna give us the blood or not?


CROWLEY
Happily. But not quite yet. I'm all for chopping Dick, but I can't have you running around with a vial of my blood, now, can I? You know the sheer number of nefarious spells my enemies can use that blood for?


DEAN
Well, then when?


CROWLEY
Last. After you've got all the other components. Most difficult, the angel part, I'm assuming. Given your role in their little apocalypse, I can't imagine the choirboys upstairs are wetting their vestments to do you – what's the word? – a solid. Unless, of course, you have an angel up your sleeve.


DEAN
Well, that'd be convenient, but, uh, no.


SAM
Don't worry about it. We'll get the angel blood one way or another. We just need you to be ready next time we call.


CROWLEY
Fine. Oh, here's a tip. I have it on good authority there's one Alpha still among us.


DEAN
Whose authority?


CROWLEY
Mine. Wily character, that Alpha vampire. Somehow made good his prison break before Cas went nuclear on the place.


DEAN
And you know this how?


CROWLEY
Keep your friends close, your enemies, blah blah. Needless to say, I keep tabs. He moves around quite a bit. But I have an inkling I know where to start the Easter-egg hunt. Happy trails.


CROWLEY disappears.


DEAN
Okay. Where, jackass?!


Flames rise on the table. As they die down, we see that words have been carved into the table.


SAM
Hoople, North Dakota.


DEAN
Piece of paper would have worked.


EXT. HOOPLE GAS N’ SIP – DAY


DEAN is leaning next to the trunk of the car as it fills with gas. SAM is leaning against the passenger side.


SAM
Hey.


SAM makes a motion with his hand to indicate drinking from a flask. DEAN takes the flask out of his jacket pocket and puts it in the car. DEAN then hangs up the gas pump and he and SAM walk towards the store.


SAM
He seem angry?


DEAN
Angry? Of course he's angry. If you were Bobby, wouldn't you be?


SAM
But was he showing signs of fatigue, like – like fritzing?


DEAN
No, actually, it was just the opposite. He said he never felt stronger.


SAM
That's what I was afraid of.


INT. HOOPLE GAS N’ SIP – DAY


SAM
The stronger he gets, the closer he comes to going full vengeful spirit. That's reality. We need to talk about what we're going to do with him.


DEAN
Do with him?


SAM
Yeah.


DEAN
Three weeks ago, you were – you were talking how this could work. And now – now you want to go Kevorkian on his ass?


SAM
I'm just saying that the lore doesn't have a single real-life example of Casper the Friendly Ghost. It's all basically poltergeists until a hunter comes along...


DEAN
Yeah, well, the lore sucks.


SAM
I'm talking pure hatred, Dean. No humanity. I mean, he could... kill... possess people. I mean, Bobby could burn this friggin' building down. Look, if he goes off the rails –


DEAN
Hey.


SAM
What?


DEAN
Check out that guy over there. He seem a little out of it to you?


They look at a man who is pumping mustard onto a hot dog.


SAM
I-I don't know. Maybe.


DEAN
What about Paula Deen over here?


They look at a woman who is staring at a refrigerator containing beer.


SAM
Yeah, they – they look like, uh...


The man is still pumping mustard onto his hot dog. Another man is slurping a giant slushie through a straw.


SAM
…like those Turducken people. It's starting. [He picks up a can and reads the ingredients.] It's the corn syrup. Everything in the store is laced with it.


DEAN
Everything?


The first man continues to pump mustard onto his hot dog.


DEAN
Hey, man, I'm gonna go into toxic shock, okay? I-I... I need my road food.


SAM
That's what Roman is banking on.


DEAN
Hey. Hey. [He holds up a pie in a plastic container.] This one says "natural." Th-th-that means it's safe. Right?


SAM puts the pie back on the shelf.


SAM
I hate to break it to you, but corn syrup is natural, technically.


DEAN
Well, then what the hell are we supposed to eat?


SAM holds up a basket containing bananas and bottled water.


EXT. LARGE HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN is looking through binoculars from the driver’s seat of the parked car.


DEAN
It's totally dark. I can't see inside.


SAM is in the passenger seat and BOBBY in the back seat.


SAM
Well, should we wait for daylight?


BOBBY
Hell no, we're not waiting. I'll scout it. See if we need to bring in the big guns.


SAM
I don't know.


BOBBY flickers and disappears.


SAM
Look, Bobby...


SAM and DEAN look at the empty back seat. DEAN looks at the house through binoculars again. BOBBY reappears.


BOBBY
Okay. Place is clear. But there's something you're gonna want to see.


INT. LARGE HOUSE – NIGHT


BOBBY, DEAN and SAM enter a large room. DEAN and SAM are carrying machetes. Three bodies are laid out on a table.


DEAN
Careful.


DEAN leans over to look at one of the bodies, which has pointed teeth and is badly burned around the mouth and neck. The next body is also badly burned in the lower half of its face.

ACT TWO
INT. LARGE HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN
You know a way to kill vamps with battery acid?


BOBBY
Only way I know is beheading.


SAM
Well, something didn't agree with them. Hey. Check out that wall. Something seem weird to you?


DEAN
Yeah, see if you can find a switch or a lever or something.


BOBBY
Don't need one.


BOBBY walks through the wall into a pink bedroom. A young WOMAN is sitting on the floor leaning against the bed with her back to BOBBY. On the other side of the wall, SAM moves books on a bookcase. He picks up one titled “How To Serve Man.”


SAM
Hey.


SAM holds up the book for DEAN to see and then presses a button that was behind the book on the bookcase. Concealed doors in front of DEAN spring open, revealing BOBBY and the YOUNG WOMAN, who gets to her feet. DEAN and SAM enter the room. The YOUNG WOMAN, who is wearing a floral pink dress or nightgown and holding a teddy bear, takes a step back against the mantelpiece.


SAM
Dean. Machete.


SAM and DEAN sheathe their machetes.


DEAN
Hey. Look. We're not gonna hurt you. Okay? [He shows his teeth.] No fangs. See?


SAM
We just want to talk.


CUT TO: the YOUNG WOMAN sitting in a chair, holding a cup of tea. DEAN's jacket is around her shoulders.


YOUNG WOMAN
I was 8. My mom left me at the playground while she ran to the store. A man approached me and said I was the prettiest girl there. And I've been living with these... things... ever since. At least until now.


SAM
Do you have any idea why?


YOUNG WOMAN
I'm one of his special girls. All the others, it was their job to make sure I was ready for the Alpha, whenever he came. Wash me... give me my IV bags every day. It's my only food. So my blood's pure.


DEAN
They've been doing this for, what, 12 years?


YOUNG WOMAN
Virgins are a delicacy. He always has at least one of us on hand.


SAM
Well, don't worry, okay? We're gonna get you back to your mother.


YOUNG WOMAN
Think she remembers me?


SAM
Of course she does. Don't you remember her?


The YOUNG WOMAN shakes her head.


DEAN
Hey, these, uh... these guys [he turns towards the dead vampires on the table] – they, uh, friends of yours?


YOUNG WOMAN
They take care of the Alpha when he's here. Or did.


SAM
What happened to them?


YOUNG WOMAN
A week ago, they came back from what they said was an easy hunt. Three humans just came, didn't put up any fight. But when they started on them, the vampires screamed in pain. The ones who ate died immediately.


SAM
And the ones who didn't?


YOUNG WOMAN
There was only one. When he saw what happened, he moved to animals. He's out hunting as we speak.


DEAN
Never heard of vamps being allergic to humans before.


SAM
You think maybe it's the corn syrup? I mean, think about it. The Gas n' Sip was lousy with stoners. All ripe for the picking.


DEAN
She did say it was an easy hunt.


SAM
Do you know where the Alpha is now?


YOUNG WOMAN
I don't know. Maybe. He has a place he goes when something's wrong. He calls it his retreat.


SAM takes out his phone.


SAM
All right.


YOUNG WOMAN
What is that?


DEAN
That's, uh, that's Sam's douche tracker. Helps us find the Alpha. All we need's an address.


YOUNG WOMAN
I don't know. But I remember things that maybe can help.


SAM
That's okay. Just do the best you can.


ACT THREE
INT. LARGE HOUSE – NIGHT


A VAMPIRE with blood around his mouth enters. He sees the open doors to the YOUNG WOMAN’s room, walks into the room and looks around. He appears alarmed at finding it empty. A MAN speaks from the large room behind him.


MAN
Finally.


The VAMPIRE’s teeth descend and he turns around. We see that the MAN is EDGAR.


EDGAR
I'd run out of magazines. Quick question. Where's your boss?


The VAMPIRE rushes at EDGAR and raises an arm to strike him. EDGAR catches his hand and squeezes it. We hear the sound of bones breaking. The VAMPIRE groans and drops to his knees in pain.


EDGAR
Let's try that again. Where is he?


VAMPIRE
Go to hell.


EDGAR
No. My neighborhood is worse than that.


EDGAR’s teeth transform into those of a vampire. He then takes on the rest of the VAMPIRE’s form.


EDGAR
[in a deep, distorted voice] Missoula, Montana.

[in a normal voice] Was that so hard?


EDGAR backhands the VAMPIRE and there is the sound of flesh tearing.


EXT. SUPERMARKET – DAY


DEAN and SAM leave the store. SAM is carrying a bag of fresh vegetables and fruit.


DEAN
I can't do this, man. I can't live on rabbit food. I'm – I'm a warrior.


SAM
Dean, you'll be fine.


DEAN
You don't know that.


SAM
So what's next on the list?


DEAN
Well, if we're bum-rushing the Alpha, then we're gonna need dead man's blood, which means a morgue. Or...


SAM
Or what?


SAM follows DEAN’s gaze to a MAN sitting on a nearby bench, drinking from a large takeout cup through a straw.


DEAN
Dude, forget the morgue. We are swimming in vamp poison.


SAM
Excuse me, sir. Hi. We, uh, we're with the... Red Cross? See, we have an emergency shortage. [He holds up his FBI badge.] And we're gonna need you to...


The MAN looks vacantly at SAM.


SAM
You're not getting a word I'm saying, are you?


DEAN
Hey. [He snaps his fingers in front of the MAN’s face and sits down next to him.] Hold out your arm. We need your blood.


SAM
Dude!


The MAN holds out his arm.


DEAN
All right, Sam. [He takes a syringe out of his jacket pocket and hands it to SAM.] Tap the keg.


SAM
Here?


DEAN
Yeah, Sam, look around. It's friggin' Woodstock. Everybody's hopped up on the brown acid. We don't need the song and dance. Give him a little prick.


SAM takes the syringe. DEAN puts an arm along the bench behind the MAN, who smiles at him. SAM sits down on the bench on the other side of the MAN and pushes the needle into the back of the MAN’s hand.


MAN
Oww! That hurts. [SAM draws blood.] This is for Hurricane Katrina, you said?


DEAN
Yes. Yes, I did.


SAM
So, look, uh... When we get there...


DEAN
Yeah?


SAM looks at their car. The YOUNG WOMAN is in the back seat.


SAM
Bobby's gonna have to hang back. Do you disagree?


DEAN
He ain't gonna like it. I mean, he helped us in getting Emily.


SAM
Look, I'm Team Bobby, too. Okay? But there's a reason we left him in the car with Emily. You know that. The more action he sees, the more chance he gets to spin out.


DEAN
All right, fine. So, we'll keep him off the front lines, and he can just, you know, keep calm and carry on, right?


A police car drives slowly behind them. War's "Why Can't We Be Friends?" plays.


♪ I seen you walkin’ down in Chinatown ♪


SAM
Well, and if he can't?


The police car siren blares. SAM hurriedly puts the syringe away.


♪ I called you but you could not look around ♪

♪ Why can't we be friends? ♪

♪ Why can't we be friends? ♪


The police car drives off. The MAN continues to slurp on his drink.


CAR – NIGHT


DEAN
When they hauled you off to vamp camp, do you remember how long the drive was?


EMILY
We left at night. Got in before dawn.


SAM
So, six, seven hours?


EMILY
I think so, yes.


SAM
Do you remember any highways?


EMILY
No. We only took back roads.


SAM
Okay. So, figure they averaged 45 miles per –


DEAN
Couldn't have been more than 300 miles.


SAM
Right.


DEAN
What direction were you going?


EMILY
I don't know. I'm sorry.


SAM
Oh, that's okay. Em, you're doing great. Um...is there anything else you remember?


EMILY
Bells. As we pulled up, I heard these loud bells.


SAM
It was still dark out?


DEAN
You thinking church?


SAM
No, that's too early. It could have been a monastery. Monks get up at 4 a.m. to pray.


DEAN
Ugh. Can't get laid. Can't sleep in. A friggin' tragedy.


SAM looks something up on his phone.


DEAN
Okay, so, Alpha's camping next to a, uh, monkey house. [He looks at SAM for his reaction.] How many we got in range?


SAM
Looks like one. Just outside, uh...


They drive past a sign that says “Welcome to Missoula, Mt.”


EXT. MONASTERY – NIGHT


DEAN and SAM’s car is parked outside the monastery gates.


EMILY
This is where he took me.


Someone appears to be patrolling the monastery grounds and another person is on the roof.


SAM
Are you sure?


EMILY
[nods] What now?


DEAN
We'll get you someplace safe. Circle back and Ginsu these leeches.


INT. MOTEL – DAY


VOICE ON TELEVISION 1
...[indistinct] but she couldn't get it.


VOICE ON TELEVISION 2
Yes, the famous Fleur-de-lis mansion. $125 million estate...


EMILY is sitting on the bed watching television. DEAN is packing a duffel bag. DEAN walks over to SAM and holds out a syringe.


DEAN
All right, here we go. 10 ccs of Vamptonite. [SAM gives him a look.] It's a thing.


EMILY
What's a Kardashian?


DEAN
Oh, that's, uh... just another bloodsucker. [EMILY looks worried.] No, it – it's... a joke.


DEAN walks over to the safe.


SAM
Here. If we're not back by dawn, call this number – Jody Mills. She's a friend. [He gives EMILY a piece of paper.] She'll take care of you. Here, use this phone.


DEAN
You gotta hang here. [He puts the flask in the safe.] For your own good. Capiche?


EMILY
Sam? Thank you.


SAM
You bet.


DEAN opens the door and it slams shut. He and SAM look at EMILY.


DEAN
It was the wind. [quietly] Chill out, Bobby. We'll be back soon.


DEAN opens the door again and he and SAM leave the room. BOBBY is standing near the door inside the room.


CUT TO: SAM and DEAN in the motel hallway.


SAM
Well, he didn't take that very well.


DEAN
How'd you think he was gonna take it?


SAM runs into a cart being pushed by a maid.


MAID
Excuse me.


SAM
Sorry.


CUT TO: EMILY watching TV in the motel room. BOBBY is standing behind her.


VOICE ON TELEVISION 3
…right our way, and it’s bringing anywhere from, we’re going to say, about half an inch to an inch of rain before it’s finished, and, uh, and some pretty breezy conditions as well. So, tomorrow, we’re going to start off pretty much like we did today. We’re going to enjoy another stunning morning…


EMILY crumples up the piece of paper SAM gave her and makes a call.


VOICE ON TELEVISION 3
…but don’t forget to grab that umbrella before you head out the door, because that rain is going to be coming down just in time I guess for your afternoon and evening.


EMILY
Hi, daddy.


VOICE ON TELEVISION 4
Now Gloria’s got something that’ll take our minds off …


BOBBY
Why, you little schemer.


EMILY
No, I'm close by. Sending you a present.


GLORIA appears on the TV next to a Sucrocorp logo.


GLORIA
And that's Dick Roman.


EMILY leaves the room.


GLORIA
Yesterday I introduced you to this rising star in American business. In this hour, we'll go behind the scenes and answer the question everyone's been asking for months – what makes Dick so hard to beat?


VOICE ON TELEVISION 5
Well thank you, Gloria…


BOBBY
You son of a bitch.


EXT. MONASTERY – DAY


DEAN and SAM are sitting in the car outside the monastery gates.


DEAN
Well, this time of day, most of them would be catching z's. They won't know what hit them. [SAM doesn’t respond.] Hey. You with me?


SAM
Yeah.


DEAN
But?


SAM
Are you sure you just want to charge in there, machetes blazing? Last time, it took a dozen hunters to take down the Alpha. And most of them didn't make it out.


DEAN
Yeah, well, you got a better idea?


CUT TO: SAM and DEAN walking up to the front door of the monastery.


DEAN
Stupid, stupid, stupid.


SAM holds up a finger. They climb the stairs and SAM pushes on the front door, which is unlatched.


SAM
Dean.


DEAN
Maybe we're too late.


As SAM steps inside, someone grabs him from just inside the door.


DEAN
Sam!


DEAN lunges after SAM. A vampire waiting behind the door grabs him.


INT. MOTEL – DAY


DICK ROMAN is speaking on television.


DICK ROMAN
You know, where I'm from, you have to bite and claw your way to the top. Once you get there, trust me, the view's incredible.


BOBBY is trying to open the safe.


DICK ROMAN
I’ve got a lot to show the American people.


BOBBY
Okay, Dean's birthday.


DICK ROMAN
…Gloria, that will really put what we’re talking about in perspective…


BOBBY
Sam's birthday.


DICK ROMAN
I’m making some very big moves right now, risking...


The television shows DICK ROMAN and SUSAN walking past a sign that says “We’re in everything.”


BOBBY
Damn it!


A lamp flies off the bedside table, a drawer opens, the light bulb in another lamp shatters, the mirror cracks and a fire roars in the fireplace and the bathroom door slams. Someone knocks at the door.


BOBBY
Son of a bitch.


MAID
Everything okay in there?


BOBBY
My birthday.


The MAID enters.


MAID
Hello?


The MAID crosses her arms, looking cold. Her breath is visible. She turns and jumps as BOBBY materializes.


BOBBY
I need your help.


MAID
Get away from me.


She turns in the other direction, but BOBBY materializes in front of her again.


BOBBY
Listen, I need out of here.


MAID
Please!

The MAID runs for the door. BOBBY lunges after her and possesses her. The MAID falls to the ground. She sits up slowly and brushes away dark liquid which runs from one of her eyes.


MAID
[in a deep voice] Just need you a little while.


The MAID gets up and walks across the room. Reflected in the broken mirror, we see BOBBY opening the safe. The camera angle then changes to the MAID opening the safe, then back to BOBBY reflected in the mirror removing the flask, then back to the MAID. The MAID leaves the room.


MAID
[in a deep voice] Just till I get the bastard.


INT. MONASTERY – DAY


We see a close-up of a man’s hand with very long fingernails. It belongs to the ALPHA VAMPIRE, who is sitting at the head of a dining table. SAM and DEAN are brought into the room by two VAMPIRES and stand at the other end of the table with the VAMPIRES behind them.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
The Winchesters. I'm intrigued.


EMILY enters the room.


SAM
Emily.


EMILY walks over to lean on the ALPHA VAMPIRE’s chair.


EMILY
Hi, Sam.


DEAN
Wow. For a girl raised in a basement, you're a hell of an actress.


EMILY
You were gonna hurt my daddy.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Hmm.


DEAN
Wow. You get a trophy in Stockholm Syndrome. And sorry to burst your bubble, but, uh... we weren't. Sam here had a better idea.


SAM
We're here to talk. That's it.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
[laughs] Now that my guys have taken your blades and your syringes of tainted blood. Is that what you mean?


DEAN
Well, we, uh... figured you might hold a grudge.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
And why would I? Because you captured me, tortured me, sold me to the king of Hell?


DEAN
That was more our grandpa.


The VAMPIRE standing behind DEAN grabs DEAN and slams his head against the table. DEAN falls to his knees and grunts as he gets back up.


DEAN
Thank you. That was awesome.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
I'm going to peel off your faces and drink you slowly.


SAM
Just listen. You need us.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Oh, yes. I am thirsty!


SAM
The plague! We know what it is! What do you know about Leviathan?


ALPHA VAMPIRE
A bit.


SAM
You know they're poisoning the food supply?


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Roman didn't mention that when we met for dinner last fall. We made lots of plans. We are on excellent terms, he and I.


DEAN
You sure about that? Did he mention that he was going to... Maui wowie the human population?


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Oh, of course. He said grabbing a snack would be easier than ever.


SAM
He said you'd all live together, didn't he? You really believe him? You think your children are dying by accident? There is pesticide in the formula!


ALPHA VAMPIRE
It suits you to think so. You need me on your side.


SAM
Look, we're not the ones burning from the inside out. Think about it. Whatever deal he made with you was crap! Trust us!


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Why are you telling me this?


SAM
Because we can stop Dick. Stop all of it. We just... We need your blood – for the weapon.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
[laughs] So now you want to prevent the extermination of the vampire race.


DEAN
No. But it beats going down with you.


There is the sound of a door opening.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Allan, darling...


A young boy walks towards the ALPHA VAMPIRE.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Come.


ALLAN stands on the other side of the ALPHA VAMPIRE’s chair to EMILY.


DEAN
Well, the creep gets creepier.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
What's wrong?


ALLAN
Edgar's here.


DEAN and SAM look at each other. The ALPHA VAMPIRE touches ALLAN’s jacket in dismissal and ALLAN leaves.


DEAN
Wow, what a funny coincidence. All right, we need soap, uh, cleanser, anything with borax in it. We need knives.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Put them in the study.


SAM
What? No. No, wait.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Word of advice, boys. You do not live through centuries of fire and ice and continental divide... by jumping to conclusions.


The VAMPIRES push DEAN and SAM towards the door.


DEAN
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.


SAM
You're making a mistake! Listen! Wait!


ALPHA VAMPIRE
[to EMILY] Never hurts to get the story first.


CUT TO: SAM and DEAN being pushed into the study.


DEAN
Hey. Hey!


A vampire closes the door.


DEAN and SAM look around the study. Bags of blood are in a refrigerated cabinet. Empty bags hang from medical stands.


CUT TO: A vampire placing a bottle of wine in a chilling bowl on the dining table, which is now set for dinner. EMILY is standing next to the ALPHA VAMPIRE at the head of the table. EDGAR walks into the room and stands at the foot of the table near several drops of DEAN's blood.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Edgar. I would've whipped you up a meal. Please, sit. I'm dying to know why you're here.


EDGAR
I think you know.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
And how is that?


EDGAR
I smell Sam and Dean Winchester.


ACT FOUR
INT. MONASTERY – DAY


DEAN tries to open the locked door of the study.


DEAN
Anything?


SAM
Nothing.


SAM is looking at the windows.


SAM
You think Edgar's here for the same reason we are? I mean, look, if they figured out that we're here to get Alpha blood for a weapon...


DEAN
I think any way you slice it, you got Pac Man and True Blood in the same room and that's bad news. I mean, he's not stupid. Why the hell do you think he locked us in here?


SAM
Dean, we're his enemy. I mean, they're like monster cousins or something. Who would you give the benefit of the doubt to? Man, you know what? Maybe the Sucro is poisoning the vamps on accident. Maybe they'll fix it.


DEAN
I think you got the oldest monster on earth thinking that he can hold his own because he always has.


SAM
Edgar's gonna eat him alive.


DEAN
Yeah. Hey. [He holds up a needle that’s attached to one of the empty blood bags.] You think you could pick a lock with this?


SAM takes the needle.


SAM
But, Dean... We gave up all our Vamptonite.


DEAN
Did we?


DEAN takes a syringe out of his boot.


CUT TO: the dining room.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Do you want the boys? Yes? You're welcome to them. I'll have them sent out.


EDGAR
How kind of you.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Oh, Edgar... You do know why Sam and Dean are here, don't you? They insist that you're exterminating us, and I thought, well, that's... impossible. Must be a mistake.


EDGAR
You're right. Of course.


CUT TO: DEAN and SAM coming down the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, a VAMPIRE grabs SAM from behind. DEAN plunges the syringe into the VAMPIRE’s neck. The VAMPIRE screams and his flesh starts to burn. He falls to the ground and dies.


DEAN
Wow.


SAM
Vamptonite.


DEAN
Friggin' vamptonite. All right, we need knives. There's got to be a prep room or a kitchen somewhere. Come on.


CUT TO: the dining room.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Here's what I don't understand, Edgar. You are aware that your little additive has side effects, yes?


EDGAR
Dick warned you there might be kinks.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Yes. He also said he'd be in touch. My children are in a panic. You don't call, you don't write, you don't send cookies. Where exactly on the list is fixing our plague?


EDGAR
My dear friend... nowhere. We want you to burn like the little roaches you are.


EDGAR puts a hand on the ALPHA VAMPIRE’s shoulder. The ALPHA VAMPIRE pushes him backwards.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Roman said if I kept quiet, I would get my reward.


EDGAR
And now you get to lay down and die. Nothing personal. Our additive kills the wolves, too... the shifters, and those disgusting little things that eat corpses. Anything with a taste for human. Except us. Mankind's a limited resource, after all.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
[advancing on EDGAR] There are seven billion... of them.


EDGAR
Only seven.


EDGAR pushes the ALPHA VAMPIRE so that he falls against the table. EMILY screams. The ALPHA VAMPIRE stands up.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
We come from you.


EDGAR
Barely.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
I am the son of Eve!


EDGAR
A pathetic mutt. Hardly one of us. I knew Eve, and honestly... your mommy was a whore.


The ALPHA VAMPIRE’s teeth transform and he lunges at EDGAR, pushing him into the wall. He grabs the chilling bucket from the table and tosses the contents at EDGAR. EDGAR’s skin starts to sizzle and burn, but he straightens up and punches the ALPHA VAMPIRE.


EDGAR
Don't squirm. I need every last drop.


EDGAR’s face transforms. DEAN advances on him from behind. EDGAR turns to face DEAN, his face returning to normal. He catches DEAN’s arm, knocking the machete DEAN was holding to the ground. EDGAR grabs DEAN’s lapels. SAM cuts off EDGAR’s head from behind.


DEAN
Grab a glass. We're juicing this freak.


EMILY
No!


DEAN
Stay back!


The ALPHA VAMPIRE sends DEAN flying over the table.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Leave her alone. She's been through quite enough.


SAM
Now, that's rich... coming from the guy who took her off the swing-set.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Do you want to do this fight? Or do you want my blood?


The ALPHA VAMPIRE sits down at the head of the table and slices his wrist with one of his long fingernails. He lets his blood drip into a glass, then rises and offers the glass to SAM.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
For taking care of Edgar. Now go.


SAM
What about the little boy?


ALPHA VAMPIRE
Are you joking?


DEAN
Do we look like we're joking? How many other kids you got in here, you freak?


ALPHA VAMPIRE
At the moment, just him. Emily... help Allan with his coat. He's leaving with Sam and Dean. Now, take it.


SAM takes the glass and he and DEAN walk towards the door.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
What? No "thank you"? Oh, right, right. Your flesh is crawling. All you really want to do is kill me now. You hate having to wait and come back and try again.


DEAN
Pretty much. I wouldn't leave that head too close to that body for too long.


ALPHA VAMPIRE
See you next season.


DEAN
Looking forward to it.


INT. MOTEL – DAY


DEAN and SAM are walking down the hallway.


DEAN
Let's never do that again. Cops thought we took that kid.


SAM
Long as he gets back to his folks, I don't care what they thought.


DEAN
We had to jump out a freakin' window, man.


DEAN sees that the door to their room is ajar. He and SAM take out their guns. DEAN opens the door and turns on the light. He sees the cracked mirror.


DEAN
Bobby. Bobby?


SAM
Dean? [He shows DEAN the open door of the safe.] He's gone.


ACT FIVE
INT. MOTEL – DAY


SAM
I'm getting trace bits of EMF, but it's fading fast. And Bobby's probably been gone three or four hours. He's got the flask, Dean. How the hell are we supposed to track him? Look, I hate to say this...


DEAN
Well, then don't. He's gone. [He laughs briefly and sighs.] How could he do this... now? I mean, we've got half the freakin' weapon, we're almost there.


SAM
It's not him. I mean, he's not thinking.


DEAN
So, what, we just keep going while he's out there like this?


SAM
Do we have any other option? I mean, it's what he'd want us to do. Right?


DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, him and Frank and Cas, if his marbles were in the bag. It's a good thing we got Crowley in our corner. Right? Seeing as how it all comes down to him. What could possibly go wrong?


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


DICK ROMAN tosses a lit match into a bowl with candles on either side. CROWLEY appears.


CROWLEY
Hello... [He looks up and the large light fixture above him changes to a devil’s trap] Dick.


DICK ROMAN
Mr. Crowley, we have so much to talk about. Take a seat.
