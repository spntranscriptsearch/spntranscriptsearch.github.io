TEASER

INT. CROWLEY’S MONSTER PRISON, DAY

The Alpha Shapeshifter, looking like Crowley, is chained to a chair and being interrogated by the demon.

ALPHA: I told you. I don’t know anything about –

CROWLEY: Sorry. But your exceptional good looks aren’t gonna buy you any mercy. I suggest you talk. What should we use next? Speculum? Or something more exotic?

ALPHA: Look, it’s Purgatory. All I know is I go there when I die. It’s not like I can draw you a map.

CROWLEY: I happen to know you can.

ALPHA: You’re wrong.

CROWLEY: My sources are unimpeachable. You’re the father of your entire species. You’re really not pulling off this dumb-blonde act. I hope you appreciate just how much effort I’ve gone to to find something that can actually hurt you. My tinkering has cost several lesser shifters their lives. [He holds up a knife.] Iridium. Rarer than hell. Would’ve been cheaper to drop a castle on you, but I think we all agree – worth it. So, you start talking or I start chopping off all the bits that stick out.

ALPHA: You go ahead, mate, see if it makes me –

Crowley stabs him in the shoulder with the knife.

CROWLEY: What was that? Purgatory’s where? [Shapeshifter spits blood in his face.] What is it with you animals? Did I tell you? This prison has a nursery. [He holds up a baby monitor. Through it babies can be heard crying.] All yours. I know how much you care about them. You’ve spent months gathering them to your bosom. Not so cocky now, are we? Finding Purgatory is important to me. You have five seconds to tell me where it is. After that, I’ll filet them in front of you. Toss their spines in your lap. Four. Three. Two.

ALPHA: Kill ’em all. We’ll make more.

Crowley puts down the baby monitor, takes up a machete and beheads the shapeshifter.

CROWLEY: Guess I kinda lost my head.

TITLE CARD

EXT. OUTSIDE AN INDUSTRIAL PLANT, NIGHT

Sam and Dean drive up in the Impala to where a couple of demons are waiting in front of a black SUV. They’re bringing a prisoner.

DEMON: You’re late.

DEAN: Traffic was a bitch.

SAM: One rugaru.

DEAN: Where’s Crowley?

DEMON: Banging a hooker in a sweet spot called None Of Your Business.

DEAN: Oh, look at that, Sam. Demon trying to be funny.

SAM: Oh, is that what just happened?

DEMON: Night, girls.

DEAN: Wait, wait. Hold up, hold up. Are we ever gonna see Crowley again or is he just gonna keep sending his demon extras to pick up his laundry?

DEMON: I’m sorry. I know you’re speaking, I see your lips moving, but I can’t understand what you’re saying ’cause I don’t speak Little Bitch.

Demons get in their car and drive off.

DEAN: Remember when we used to gank demons?

+++

INT. HOUSE, NIGHT

Sam and Dean return to their current base, a run-down house they’re squatting in.

DEAN: No man, screw it, I’m done.

SAM: Calm down.

DEAN: We’ve been going on these freaking Crowley runs and it’s not getting us anywhere.

SAM: Dean –

DEAN: I mean, the only thing that’s really changed, is now I need a daily rape shower.

SAM: OK, you’re right. Let’s go with Plan B. Oh yeah, we don’t have one. So till we do, sorry dude, stock up on soap-on-a-rope. Dean, if you wanna get my soul back, that’s what we gotta do, OK?

DEAN: Yeah… You even want it back?

SAM: I’m working for Crowley, aren’t I?

DEAN [goes to pour himself a drink, turning his back on Sam]: Yeah, well, who says he’s gonna hold up his end, you know? It is Crowley. You ever think of that? Right? [He turns back around to find Sam gone out of sight.] So, I guess the moment’s over, is that what you’re saying? Sam! [When he doesn’t get an answer, Dean draws his gun and starts looking for Sam, only to find him lying unconscious in the next room. A demon comes up behind him and knocks him out.]

+++

Sam and Dean come to, bound to a couple of chairs.

DEAN: What now?

SAM: I think I know who you can ask.

DEAN: Evil bitch.

MEG: Keep sweet talking me, this could go a whole new direction.

DEAN: Meg. I’ve been dying to see you again.

MEG: Well, here I am, big boy. So, what should we do now?

DEAN: How about I rip you to shreds?

MEG: Kinky, I like. A little Q&A first, if you don’t mind. Now, where’s your boss?

SAM: You think we work for somebody?

MEG: I happen to know for a fact you’ve been juggling Crowley’s orphans. Now where is he?

SAM: Don’t know. Don’t care.

MEG: You’ve been working his beat for months.

SAM: Doesn’t mean we get face time.

MEG [straddles Dean’s lap]: Where’s he take all those things you snatch up for him? I bet you an all-day sucker that’s where his majesty’s holed up. [When Dean doesn’t answer, she holds a knife to his throat.] OK, officially over the foreplay. Satisfy me, or I please myself!

SAM laughs.

DEAN: Something funny, Sam?

SAM: Yeah, Meg.

DEAN: Really? ’Cause where I’m sitting…

SAM: Don’t worry. She can’t do jack squat. She’s totally screwed.

DEAN: Sam, not helping!

SAM: Look at her, Dean. She’s furious. If she could kill you, she’d’ve done it by now. She’s running.

MEG: Am I?

SAM: Judging by the level of flop sweat on all of you, yeah. Which means you’re running from Crowley. Which makes sense. Crowley would want to hunt down all the Lucifer loyalists now that he’s the big man on campus.

MEG: How would you know?

SAM: It’s what I’d do. [to Dean] She can’t kill us. She needs us to get her to Crowley so she can stick that knife in his neck. It’s him or her.

DEAN: Well, I hope you both lose. But good luck.

SAM: So, you know what you gotta do now, right?

MEG: Let me guess. You’re gonna tell me.

SAM: Work with us.

DEAN: Whoa, what?

SAM: We’ll hand you Crowley with a bow. On one condition: we come with you and you help us wring a little something out of him before you hack him to bits.

MEG: What?

SAM: Doesn’t matter. Question is, can you get us what we need?

MEG: I apprenticed under Alastair in Hell just like your brother. So Dean, can I make Crowley do whatever I want?

DEAN: Yeah, she can.

MEG: It’s a deal then. Hugs and puppies all around!

DEAN: You gonna untie us?

MEG: Please. Don’t pretend you don’t enjoy it.

She turns to leave. One of her companions walks up to Dean, staring intently at him.

DEAN: You gonna kiss me?

MEG [calling back over her shoulder to the demon]: Come on!

+++

DEAN: What are you doing?

SAM: What do you mean?

DEAN: I mean, what are you doing!?

SAM: Dean, you wanted to screw over Crowley. Merry Christmas. What?

DEAN: You wanna work with a demon again?

SAM: We’re working with demons now. I’m doing this because I wanna stop.

DEAN: She killed Ellen and Jo!

SAM: I know. But you can’t look at his emotionally, Dean. We need her.

DEAN: The hell we do! That little bitch is gonna screw us over so fast –

SAM: Of course. Which is why we’ll screw her first. Meg and her little posse are dead the second we’re done with them.

DEAN: Yeah, if they don’t kill us.

SAM: They won’t. ’Cause we’re bringing insurance.

+++

EXT., ROAD OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, NIGHT

Sam is trying to call Castiel.

SAM: Castiel, we need you. It’s important. [no reaction] Cas, we found something. It’s this gold box. Apparently Nazis were after it back in the day, someone opened it and their face melted off. I think it’s – ready for this – the Ark of the Covenant. Yeah. So…

CASTIEL: I’m here, Sam. Where is the box?

SAM: I can’t believe you fell for that. That was the plot of Raiders, idiot.

CASTIEL: I’m mid-battle, Sam.

SAM: I could give a rat’s ass about your little pissing match with Raphael.

CASTIEL: Listen to me, Sam –

SAM: No, you listen! I don’t care what you’re dealing with up in Heaven. You owe me.

CASTIEL: You may not care, but believe me –

SAM: I’m sorry, do you think we’re here to talk this out?

CASTIEL: Sam, I can’t just –

SAM: If you don’t help us, I will hunt you down and kill you.

CASTIEL: Will you, boy? How?

SAM: I don’t know yet. But I will look until I find out, and I don’t sleep.

CASTIEL: You need help, Sam.

SAM: I need your help.

+++

INT. HOUSE, NIGHT

Sam and Castiel enter.

DEAN: You actually showed. Wow, Sam, I owe you a chicken dinner. What happened?

SAM: No big. This is what friends do for each other.

+++

Castiel is working a ritual to locate Crowley.

CASTIEL: It’s not working. Crowley’s hidden from me.

DEAN: Well, looks like we’re gonna have to try this the hard way.

+++

INT. CAMPBELL COMPOUND, NIGHT

Sam, Dean and Castiel are searching Samuel’s study for clues. They get caught.

SAMUEL: Can I help you? What do you want?

DEAN: We wanna know where Crowley is.

SAMUEL: If I even knew, why would I tell you?

DEAN: ’Cause you’re our grandfather.

SAM: Samuel, I’m gonna get my soul back.

SAMUEL: Who says you can get it back?

SAM: Me.

SAMUEL: Look, I’d like to help, but I’m sorry.

DEAN: It’s your grandson’s soul.

SAMUEL: I can’t.

DEAN: What is wrong with you? Do you wanna work for Crowley? Cas, can you give us a minute? [The angel disappears.] We’re your blood. But if you don’t wanna help us I can’t make you. But I just gotta know why. What is Crowley holding over you? You owe us that.

Samuel takes out a picture of young Mary and hands it to Dean.

DEAN: Mom?

SAMUEL: He’s gonna give her back to me.

DEAN: Crowley’s gonna bring mom back from the dead?

SAMUEL: You tell me you don’t want her back.

Dean looks back at the photograph, doesn’t answer.

SAMUEL: You know, the one difference between us: you know how to live without her.

DEAN: Look, I know how you feel.

SAMUEL: No, you don’t. She’s my daughter, and she’s dead, and I can do something about it.

DEAN: Do you really think Crowley is gonna make good here?

SAMUEL: He brought Sam back! And me!

DEAN: Trust me, don’t go down that road.

SAMUEL: What are you saying?

DEAN: I’m saying, stop trying. It’s gonna go nowhere good. Samuel, I know we’ve had our differences, but I’m your grandson and I’m telling you that this is wrong for so many reasons.

SAMUEL: You hypocrite!

DEAN: I’m asking you to learn from our mistakes! Doing this, this is how the bad guy gets us every time. It’s our Achilles' heel. Apparently it runs in the family. We will figure something else out. Okay?

SAMUEL: I’m sorry Dean, but I –

DEAN: Fine. Bring her back. But what are you gonna tell her? You gonna tell her you made a deal with a demon? That you wouldn’t help out her sons?

SAMUEL: That’s enough! Just get out.

+++

INT. HOUSE, NIGHT

Castiel is watching TV, while Sam and Dean sit at a table, doing research.

CASTIEL: It’s very complex.

DEAN: Mm-hmm.

CASTIEL: If the pizza man truly loves this babysitter, why does he keep slapping her rear? Perhaps she’s done something wrong.

DEAN: You’re watching porn? Why?

CASTIEL: It was there.

DEAN: You don’t watch porn in a room full of dudes. And you don’t talk about it. Just turn it off. [to Sam when Cas looks down at his lap] Well, now he’s got a boner.

There’s a knock on the door. Dean goes to open it, finding Samuel.

SAMUEL: This what you boys do, sit around watching pornos with angels?

CASTIEL: We’re not supposed to talk about it.

DEAN: Why are you here, Samuel?

SAMUEL: It’s what Mary would want. Now, this is what I know. Whatever we bag ends up there. [He shows them a map with a location marked.] That’s where he tortures ’em, interrogates ’em, I don’t really know. Only been outside the places, but it’s a death trap. Nothing gets in that Crowley doesn’t want in and nothing gets out, period.

DEAN: Well, thanks.

SAMUEL: I wish you wouldn’t do this.

SAM: Come with us.

SAMUEL: I may be soft, but I’m not suicidal.

+++

EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, NIGHT

Meg and her posse are waiting.

MEG [to Castiel]: Remember me? I sure remember you, Clarence.

CASTIEL: Why are we working with these abominations?

MEG: Keep talking dirty. Makes my meatsuit all dewy.

DEAN: Alright, simmer down. We know where Crowley is.

MEG: Great. Do tell.

SAM: Yeah, tell you, so you can just leave us for dead.

MEG: You boys have serious abandonment issues, you know that?

SAM: We’ll show you, alright? But we’re all going together.

MEG: What, I’m just supposed to trust you?

SAM: No, you’re not that stupid. Give me the knife for a minute.

MEG: No, I’m not that stupid.

SAM: Do you want us to take you to Crowley or not?

She hands Sam Ruby’s knife. He uses it to kill the demon that was scowling at Dean earlier.

SAM: You saw him. He was more interested in killing us than getting the job done. I just did all of us a favor.

MEG: Hey! You just gonna keep that?

SAM: You took this from us. I’m taking it back. We leave in one hour.

+++

INT. HOUSE, NIGHT

Dean is packing up for the hunt.

DEAN: You know, Cas, you could help.

CASTIEL: I’m ambivalent about what we’re attempting.

DEAN: Well, breaking into monster Gitmo is not exactly a two-for-one in the champagne room.

CASTIEL: I’m not sure retrieving Sam’s soul is wise.

DEAN: Wait, what? Why?

CASTIEL: I want him to survive.

DEAN: What are you talking about?

CASTIEL: Sam’s soul has been locked in the cage with Michael and Lucifer for more than a year. And they have nothing to do but take their frustrations out on him. You understand? If we try to force that mutilated thing down Sam’s gullet, we have no idea what will happen. It could be catastrophic.

DEAN: You mean he dies.

CASTIEL: I mean, he doesn’t. Paralysis. Insanity. Psychic pain so profound that he’s locked inside himself for the rest of his life.

DEAN: But you’re saying you don’t know anything for sure. I mean, he could be fine.

CASTIEL: He could be, yes.

DEAN: Okay then.

CASTIEL: But I sincerely doubt it.

DEAN: Well, if he’s not fine, then you fix him.

CASTIEL: Dean, I wouldn’t know where to begin.

DEAN: Then you figure it out, Cas. Come on. I mean, the guy’s a frigging replicant. He needs his soul. Look, we get it back. And if there are complications, then we will figure out a way to deal with those, too.

CASTIEL: Of course. [Dean turns away, thinking he’s won the argument.] Or we fail, and Sam suffers horrifically.

Sam is seen, standing in the shadows, overhearing the conversation.

+++

EXT. OUTSIDE CROWLEY’S MONSTER PRISON, NIGHT

DEAN: Seems pretty quiet.

CASTIEL: It’s not, I can feel it. Meet me at the side door.

+++

Castiel opens a door to let Dean, Sam and the demons inside the prison.

DEAN: This all seem a little too easy for you?

SAM: Way too easy.

+++

INT. HALLWAY LINED WITH CELLS, NIGHT

BRIGITTA [djinn from 6.01]: Is someone there? Please. Please help me. You gotta get me out of here. Please! You gotta get me out of here.

SAM: Come on, Dean. We gotta move.

+++

INT. HALLWAY, NIGHT

CASTIEL: Wait.

DEAN: What is it?

Dogs are heard barking in the distance.

MEG: Damn it. Here come the guards.

DEAN: Hellhounds. Go!

They run for the nearest set of doors, wedge them shut with a piece of wood and draw a salt line. The two demons who were accompanying Meg haven’t made it and are ripped apart by the hellhounds on the other side.

DEAN: I knew this was a trap.

MEG: What do you want, a cupcake?

SAM: Alright, that should keep them out.

DEAN: Not for long. How many of them are there?

MEG: Lots. I’ll be pulling for you … from Cleveland.

DEAN: What?!

MEG: I didn’t know this was gonna happen. Bright side: them chewing up my meatsuit ought to buy you a few seconds. Seacrest out.

Meg tries to vacate her host body, but can’t.

CASTIEL: A spell, I think, from Crowley. Within these walls you’re locked inside your body.

DEAN: Karma’s a bitch, bitch.

Sam takes out Ruby’s knife.

DEAN: What are you doing, gonna slash at thin air until you hit something?

SAM [to Meg]: You can see them. Take this. Hold them off. It’s our best shot.

MEG: At Crowley. Take it and go. You kill the smarmy dick. I’ll hold off the dogs.

DEAN: How you gonna do that?

Meg grabs Castiel by the neck and kisses him, at the same time removing his Angel blade. Castiel pushes her up against the wall and returns the kiss with interest.

MEG: What was that?

CASTIEL: I learned that from the pizza man.

MEG: Well, A plus for you. I feel so … clean. Okay, gotta go.

DEAN: Whoa, whoa, is that gonna work on a hellhound?

MEG: Well, we’re about to find out. Run.

The boys take off. Meg faces the shaking doors and prepares to fight the hounds.

+++

INT. STAIRWELL, NIGHT

DEAN: Can’t see jack.

Suddenly, there is a blinding light and Castiel vanishes. Turns out it was Samuel, banishing him with a blood sigil.

DEAN: Cas?!

SAM [seeing Samuel]: Dean.

DEAN: You sold us out? [Two demons appear behind Sam and Dean, holding onto them.] Damn you, Samuel.

CROWLEY: Yes. And I have to say, best purchase I’ve made since Dick Cheney.

DEAN: Hiya, Crowley. How’s tricks?

CROWLEY: Above your pay grade. Been working. Big things. Alas, you’ll be too dead to participate.

DEAN: Really?

CROWLEY: Shame I have to do away with you both. Rather enjoyed your indentured servitude.

+++

Sam and Dean are thrown into separate cells. We see Meg finishing off the last hellhound, then getting ambushed by the demon possessing Christian Campbell. Back to Dean in his cell.

DEAN: Sam?!

SAM: Yeah.

DEAN: I’m standing in pee.

SAM: Consider yourself lucky.

DEAN: Yikes. That sucks.

A little window in the door is opened from the outside by Samuel.

DEAN: You want forgiveness, find a priest.

SAMUEL: I just want you to understand.

DEAN: Oh, I understand… that you’re a liar. You talk about putting blood first, which is funny ’cause you sound just like my dad. The difference is, he actually did.

SAMUEL: I am putting blood first.

DEAN: Oh, gimme a break!

SAMUEL: Mary’s my blood! My daughter! Don’t come at me like I sold you out, Dean. You sold out your own mother. It was her or Sam, and you chose Sam, plain and simple.

DEAN: Oh, that is such crap! You wanna know what really happened? You chose a demon over your own grandsons!

SAMUEL: See it how you want. I don’t even know what Sam is. And you want me to protect him? And you? You’re a stranger. No, really, tell me: what exactly are you supposed to be to me?

DEAN: I’ll tell you who I am. I’m the guy you never wanna see again. ’Cause I’ll make it out of here, trust me. And the next time you see me, I’ll be there to kill you.

SAMUEL: Don’t think there’s gonna be a next time.

DEAN: Whatever gets you through the night.

The two demons working for Crowley drag Dean out of his cell and down the corridor while Samuel just stands by. Sam hears this.

+++

In another room Meg is strapped to a metal table for torture.

Christian!DEMON: So, Crowley wants to know… well, everything. Told me to carve out of you.

MEG: Whatever makes you feel like a man.

DEMON: Ha ha. You talk a mean game. But you’re scared.

+++

Sam is pacing in his cell, then squats down and bites into his arm at the wrist, drawing blood.

+++

Dean is pushed into a room with blood and guts all over it. Then the demons bring in two ghouls.

DEMON: Enjoy.

DEAN: Alright, alright. Shawshank’s a great flick, but let’s skip the shower scene, huh?

GHOUL [to his companion]: Look, breakfast.

+++

Demons enter Sam’s cell.

SAM [crouching by the wall furthest from the door]: What did you do with my brother?

DEMON: Oh, you’ll find out. You’re about to join him.

They get caught in a devil’s trap Sam has painted on the ceiling using his own blood.

+++

Elsewhere, Dean is fighting the ghouls.

DEAN: Frickin’ hate ghouls!

At the same time, Sam is running down a hallway, looking for him.

SAM: Dean?!

DEAN: Let me go, son of a bitch!

SAM: Dean!

Sam arrives just in time to save Dean from getting eaten. He stakes one of the ghouls with a metal bar ripped off the wall.

+++

MEG: You know, you’re sticking that thing in all the wrong places.

Christian!DEMON: Really? You sure were squealing.

MEG: Knock yourself out. It’s a host body. Some girl from Cheboygan, moved to LA to be an actress. It’s probably not even the worst thing that ever happened to her.

Meg screams as the demon continues torturing her with Ruby’s knife, then suddenly starts laughing.

DEMON: What are you laughing at?

Dean appears behind him, grabs the knife out of his hand and stabs him in the back.

MEG: Dean Winchester’s behind you, meatsack.

SAM: We should go.

Dean unties Meg.

+++

INT. HALLWAY, DAY

Crowley goes to pay djinn Brigitta a visit in her cell.

CROWLEY: Hello, sweetheart. Feeling chatty this morning, are we? Do hope so. Wouldn’t want to harm a hair on that pretty little head. So, you ready to tell me all about your daddy? [Fire alarm rings.] Hold that thought.

+++

Crowley arrives at the room where Meg was being tortured and finds Dean sounding the alarm.

CROWLEY: You should be ghoul scat by now. [Sam knocks him down from behind.] Really necessary? I just had this dry-cleaned. [He finds himself inside another devil’s trap.] So, to what do I owe the reach-around?

MEG [enters]: Crowley.

CROWLEY: Whore.

MEG: Okay, you know what. [She uses her demonic powers to injure Crowley internally, making him cough up blood.] The best torturers never get their hands dirty. Sam wants a word with you.

CROWLEY: What can I do for you, Sam?

SAM: You know damn well. I want my soul back.

MEG: And here I thought you just grew some balls, Sam.

SAM: Well?

CROWLEY: No.

DEAN: Meg?

Meg tortures Crowley some more.

CROWLEY: I can’t.

SAM: Can’t or won’t?

CROWLEY: I said ‘can’t’. I meant ‘can’t’, you mop-headed lumberjack. I was lucky to get this much of you out. Going back in there for the sloppy bits? No way. I’m good, but those two in there? Forget it.

SAM: How do I know you’re not lying?

CROWLEY: You don’t. But it doesn’t change anything. I’m telling you. Sam, why do you want the thing back? Satan’s got one juicy source of entertainment in there. I’d swallow a rag off a bathhouse floor before I took that soul. Unless you want to be a drooling mess.

MEG: Sam, I hate to say it, but he’s right.

SAM: Yeah, right. I get it. Thanks. He’s all yours.

DEAN: Whoa, what are you, crazy? He’s our only hope.

SAM: Dean, you heard him. He can’t get it. He’s useless.

Dean hands Meg the knife. She goes to enter the devil’s trap.

MEG: You’ll let me back out, right? [They nod.]

MEG [to Crowley]: This is for Lucifer, you pompous little –

Crowley takes her down in an instant and uses the knife to break the devil’s trap. Pins Sam and Dean to opposite walls.

CROWLEY: That’s better. You don’t know torture, you little insect.

Castiel reappears suddenly.

CASTIEL: Leave them alone.

CROWLEY: Castiel, haven’t seen you all season. You the cavalry now?

CASTIEL: Put the knife down.

CROWLEY: You that bossy in Heaven? Hear you’re losing out to Raphael. The whole affair makes Vietnam look like a roller derby. Hey, what’s in the gift bag?

CASTIEL [taking a skull out of the bag he’s holding]: You are.

CROWLEY: Not possible.

CASTIEL: You didn’t hide your bones as well as you should have.

CROWLEY [claps mockingly]: Cookie for you.

CASTIEL: Can you restore Sam’s soul or not?

CROWLEY: If I could help out in any other –

DEAN: Answer him!

CROWLEY: I can’t.

Castiel incinerates Crowley’s bones. Bye bye, King of Hell. Meg vanishes into thin air.

DEAN: Well, she’s smart, I’ll give her that. I was gonna kill her, too. [to Cas] ’Course, I’d have given you an hour with her first.

CASTIEL: Why would I want that?

+++

EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON, DAY

Sam, Dean and Castiel are standing by the Impala, about to take off.

DEAN: Thanks, Cas. Hadn’t it been for you –

CASTIEL: Crowley was right. It’s not going well for me upstairs.

DEAN: If there’s anything we can do –

CASTIEL: There isn’t. I wish circumstances were different. Much of the time I’d rather be here.

DEAN: Look, Cas, we know you got a steaming pile on your plate. There’s no need for apologies. We’re your friends.

CASTIEL: Listen, Sam, we’ll find another way.

SAM: You really wanna help? Prison full of monsters. Can’t just leave ’em, can’t let ’em go.

CASTIEL: I understand. [He disappears with a flutter of wings.]

DEAN: He’s right, you know?

SAM: About?

DEAN: About your soul. We’ll figure something else out.

SAM: No, we won’t.

DEAN: Why, because Crowley said –

SAM: You heard what Crowley said. And I heard what Cas said. Putting this thing back in would smash me to bits.

DEAN: We don’t know that for sure.

SAM: You know what? When angels and demons agree on something, call me nuts, I pay attention.

DEAN: You say this now? After we practically died trying to –

SAM: Exactly! We almost got ourselves killed. I mean, how many times do we risk our asses for this? Enough’s enough.

DEAN: Sam –

SAM: I don’t think I want it back.

DEAN: You don’t even know what you’re saying.

SAM: No, I’m saying something you don’t like. You obviously care, a lot. But I think maybe I’m better off without it.

DEAN: You’re wrong. You don’t know how wrong you are.

SAM: I’m not sure about that. [He turns and starts to walk away.]

DEAN: Sam, don’t walk away. Sam! Sam!
