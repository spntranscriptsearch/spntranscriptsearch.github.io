ACT ONE
NOW

[Exterior – Styne Hall – Day]

[The school bell has rung and students are exiting the building.]

THE BULLY

Styne. Yo. Hey, man. Hold up!

[CYRUS STYNE turns around.]

CRYUS

What?

THE BULLY

Me and my boys, we got a bet. How much of a virgin are you?

CYRUS

What?

THE BULLY

I mean you ain't never got laid before, obviously. You've seen a boob, right? I don't mean on Game of Thrones, I'm talkin' about in the wild, you know.

CYRUS

Is this a joke?

THE BULLY

I look like a comedian to you? Answer the question.

CYRUS

(pauses, then smirks) You look like the kind of dude who wants people to think he's hood. But no. See the, hundred dollar haircut, the hybrid keys, I'd say you grew up in a white-bread wonderland. Your dad's probably a dentist, your mom's mostly Botox and they both bang the pool boy. Oh and you like rap, but you're scared of black people. Even Will Smith.

THE BULLY'S FRIENDS

Damn! (They give each other high fives and fist bumps)

THE BULLY

Hey you got a mouth on you, you little bitch!

[He pushes CYRUS onto the ground. CYRUS' cousin ELI gets out a car that is waiting a short distance away.]

THE BULLY

I'm gonna kick your ass.

ELI (walking over)

There a problem here?

THE BULLY

No, man. All good.

ELI

Well I wasn't asking you, dickbag. Cy, we got a problem?

CYRUS

No, it's fine. Let's go.

(Zoom in on Eli's face, eyes narrowed at THE BULLY)

[CUT TO EXTERIOR – CONVENIENCE STORE – DAY]

[THE BULLY exits a convenience store with a large slushie. Someone follows him in a car. THE BULLY notices and gets an uneasy look on his face. He turns into an alley and starts walking faster, clearly anxious. He turns another corner and walks straight into ELI. Slushie flies up into the air.]

ELI

(Tasting some of the slushie that landed on him) Cherry berry. My favorite.

THE BULLY

No, man. Got no beef with you.

ELI

You put hands on my cousin?

[ROSCOE comes up from behind THE BULLY and puts a plastic bag over THE BULLY's head before the latter can do anything. He cannot escape.]

[TITLE CARD]

[Exterior – a secluded, wooded area – day]

[DEAN and SAM cut wood and bring it over to a pyre they have built for CHARLIE. We see flashbacks of the brothers' interactions with CHARLIE.]

CHARLIE

What about you, you gonna let it go?

DEAN

Never.

CHARLIE

That's my boys.

[They hug.]

SAM

Charlie. Hey! I got you.

CHARLIE

I forgive you, Dean.

DEAN

I'm so sorry, kiddo.

[In the present, DEAN carries CHARLIE's body, wrapped in white material, to the pyre and with SAM's help, places her on it.]

CHARLIE

I love you.

DEAN

I know.

[SAM and DEAN stand next to each other, watching CHARLIE's body burn. SAM breaks the silence.]

SAM

Charlie. We're gonna miss you. You were the best. And I'm so sorry –

DEAN

Shut up. You got her killed, you don't get to apologize.

SAM

We were trying to help you.

DEAN

I didn't need help. I told you to leave it alone.

SAM

What was I supposed to do, just – watch you die?

DEAN

The Mark isn't gonna kill me.

SAM

Maybe not, but – when it's done with you, you won't be you anymore. Dean, you're all I've got. So of course, I was gonna fight for you because that's what we do. And listen, I had a shot—

DEAN

Yeah you had a shot. Charlie's dead. Nice shot.

SAM

You think I'm – You think I'm ever – gonna forgive myself for that?

DEAN

You wanna know what I think? I think it should be you up there, not her. This thing, with Cas, and the book, ends now. Shut it down before somebody else gets hurt. You understand me?

[Long pause as SAM stares into the fire, digesting this.]

SAM

And what about you?

DEAN

Oh I'm gonna find whoever did this. And I'm gonna rip apart everything and everyone that they ever loved. And then I'm gonna tear out their heart.

SAM

Is that you talking or the Mark?

DEAN

Does it matter?

[DEAN turns and walks away. SAM watches him leave.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR – STYNE HOUSE, CYRUS' BEDROOM – NIGHT]

[CYRUS is playing a video game with one of his friends online.]

CYRUS' FRIEND

There you go, nice. Dude – you still coming to LA?

CYRUS

Hope so. It's just my family. If they found out I was moving they'd kill me.

[CYRUS' FRIEND laughs.]

CYRUS

No. Literally. My folks are like, weird. Scary weird.

[ELI opens the door.]

ELI

Your father wants to see you.

[CUT TO BASEMENT OF STYNE HOUSE].

MONROE

So, as I understand, you didn't get the book, and you lost an arm. Not what I call a win, son. And you know what we do to losers.

ELDON

Yes sir. That's why I brought you a present. I found a stash of magic like you wouldn't believe.

MONROE

Try me.

ELDON

The Winchesters dragged me to their – clubhouse. It's filled with folklore, artifacts, maybe even the Book of the Damned. Now you give me a few guys, and I'll make the biggest score this family's ever seen.

MONROE

Gonna need a new arm.

[CYRUS enters, escorted by ELI.]

MONROE

My boy! It's a special day.

CYRUS

It is?

[CYRUS looks over and sees THE BULLY strapped to the metal operating table with a gag in his mouth. CYRUS looks uncomfortable.]

MONROE

Eli told me 'bout your little scuffle. And I thought to myself, now this, this is a teachable moment. See, men like him – well, trash like him, now they're only good for one thing. Spare parts. You're gonna carve him up.

[CYRUS looks both revolted and scared.]

CYRUS

I can't.

ELDON

Sure you can. It's easy.

CYRUS

No. It's not – I don't want to.

ELI

What? Be like us?

CYRUS

That's not what I meant.

MONROE

Good. Because that – it's your legacy. You will not turn your back on this family. Now – you've always been soft, Cyrus, you're the baby, it's natural. But that ends now.

[MONROE holds CYRUS so that he can't move while the lady Styne puts a white lab coat on CYRUS. CYRUS looks upset.]

MONROE

See, either you're gonna do this, or I'm gonna butcher that boy. And then I'm gonna put you up on the table, and go to work. You understand?

CYRUS

(whispers) Okay.

[MONROE picks up a scalpel and places it in CYRUS' hand. THE BULLY struggles and whimpers against his restraints. MONROE guides CYRUS' hand over THE BULLY's exposed chest. CYRUS turns his head and tries not to look, but MONROE uses his free hand to turn CYRUS' head and force him to look.]

MONROE

This is who you are, son.

[CYRUS closes his eyes for a second and cringes as he cuts into THE BULLY. He opens them again and looks at what he is doing with an expression of horror on his face. THE BULLY yells in pain.]

[CUT TO EXTERIOR – MOTEL PARKING LOT – DAY]

[DEAN exits a motel room, on his cell phone.]

DEAN

Rudy. I just sent you some security cam footage of a black sedan. I need you to run the plates.

RUDY

Yeah can do, just give me a sec here. (pause) Weird. Uh, the vehicle's registered to Eldon Styne out of Shreveport, Louisiana, but there's no street address. This guy got something to hide?

DEAN

Yeah, big time. I'll fill you in later, thanks.

RUDY

Yeah sure, but um, isn't that what Sam's for?

DEAN

He's busy.

[Dean hangs up and gets into the Impala.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR – ROWENA'S HIDEOUT – NIGHT]

CASTIEL

Stop looking at me.

ROWENA

I'm sorry. You're just fascinating. An angel that rejected Heaven. That's like a fish that wants to fly, or a dog that thinks he's people.

CASTIEL

Well, I'm a lot like people.

ROWENA

Keep telling yourself that, dear.

[The sound of the door clanging open and shut interrupts them, and SAM enters.]

ROWENA

Well about bloody time.

CASTIEL

Where's Charlie?

[SAM just looks at him with a pained expression on his face and shakes his head.]

CASTIEL

Oh no, god. I should have gone after her. I – what happened?

SAM

Me. The Stynes, um... they caught up with her, and uh, Dean's gone after them.

CASTIEL

So he knows.

SAM

Yeah.

CASTIEL

Well what now?

SAM

I'm shutting this down, I promised Dean—

ROWENA

Er, hello? Anyone want to tell me what's going on?

SAM AND CASTIEL

No.

CASTIEL

What about her?

SAM

Guess.

CASTIEL

I'd be happy to kill her, she just called me a fish. (long pause) What about Dean?

SAM

We uh...we should be able to track him. I lowjacked the Impala a few weeks back just in case. Here.

[SAM pulls out his phone, and CAS comes over to look. A map with a flashing dot labelled Dean shows where he is, as the phone receives an email notification from Charlie. SAM opens it, and it says, "Sam, can't talk now. DL this file!" Attached is a document labelled "FORDEAN.doc". SAM downloads it, then walks over and shows the file to ROWENA.]

SAM

Is this what I think it is?

ROWENA

Oh, that little minx. She's cracked the code.

SAM

Can you read the Book of the Damned with this?

ROWENA

Every last word.

[SAM looks at CASTIEL.]

ROWENA

We can cure the Mark of Cain.

SAM

Cas, go find Dean, make sure he doesn't go too far off the reservation, okay?

CASTIEL

What are you doing?

SAM

I'm saving my brother.

CASTIEL

You told Dean—

SAM

—I know what I told Dean. Cas, look. I've been the one out there, messed up and scared. And alone. And Dean—

CASTIEL

He did whatever he could to save you.

SAM

Yes. I mean, it's become his thing. I owe him this. I owe him everything. Look I know he pretends he can ride the Mark out, but you and I know the truth. We know what happens if we don't cure him. We both know where that road ends.

CASTIEL

Black eyes and blood.

SAM

Yes. Go. Find him, Cas. Keep him safe.

CASTIEL

Okay.

[CASTIEL leaves.]

ROWENA

Oooh, I do love a bit of intrigue.

SAM

Right, less talk, more translating. Go.

ROWENA

About that. I said I can read the book, never said I would.

SAM

We had a deal.

ROWENA

We did, we do. And it's time you held up your end. I want my son dead.

SAM

After—

ROWENA

—Now. Once I cast the spell – and you need me to cast that spell – who knows what'll happen.

[SAM slams his hand angrily on the table.]

SAM

(yells) I don't have time for this!

ROWENA

Right, you don't! Your brother's a walkin' freakin' time bomb, and the clock, she's a ticking. So you will kill my son, and you will do it my way, now!

ACT TWO
[INTERIOR – STYNE BASEMENT – NIGHT]

[THE BULLY lies dead and bloody on the operating table. CYRUS sits at a table with his head on his arms, blood on his white lab coat. ELDON flexing the new arm that used to be on THE BULLY.]

MONROE

Well done.

[MONROE claps a hand on CYRUS' shoulder. CYRUS doesn't say anything, doesn't move. He looks haunted, and his eyes are red and wet with tears.]

MONROE

You know, in the old country, they'd make you eat your first heart. But I like to think we're a little more civilized. (to the ELDON) How's it fit?

ELDON

(flexing his new arm) Like a glove.

CYRUS

Can I go?

ELDON

Nah. You're coming with me.

[CUT TO EXTERIOR – SUBURBAN INTERSECTION IN SHREVEPORT – DAY]

[DEAN, in the Impala, turns a corner. A cop's siren and flashing lights go off and appear behind him. DEAN pulls over. Knowing they will ask him for his license and registration, DEAN pulls out the first fake I.D. he can find. He looks at it, frowning, then shrugs.]

DEAN

What's the problem, officer?

OFFICER 1

License and reg.

DEAN

Yep. (hands it over)

OFFICER 1

Ashley J. Williams, huh?

DEAN

You can call me Ash.

OFFICER 1

Out of the car, Ashley.

[DEAN gets out of the car.]

DEAN

Well I wasn't speeding, I'm sober, mostly sober, so what's this about?

OFFICER 1

Blinker's out.

[OFFICER 2, standing behind the car, takes his nightstick and smashes the Impala's right-side taillight.]

DEAN

Hey!

OFFICER 2

That's a violation.

DEAN

Don't.

[OFFICER 2 smashes the other taillight.]

OFFICER 1

Two lights out.

DEAN

Son of a bitch!

[DEAN tries to charge at OFFICER 2 but OFFICER 1 grabs him and slams him against the Impala, then handcuffs him.]

OFFICER 1

And attempted assault of a police officer. Looks like we're taking you down to the station, boy.

DEAN

Oh I ain't your boy, Cletus.

OFFICER 1

Right now you are, so you best settle. Or you're gonna get an ass-whuppin', instead of a phone call.

[CUT TO INTERIOR – PHIL'S DINER – DAY]

[WAITER walks over to CROWLEY who is sitting at the bar.]

WAITER

Everything alright?

CROWLEY

Fantastic. That is the best cup of coffee I've ever had.

WAITER

Thanks. Roast the beans myself.

CROWLEY

Really?

WAITER

Oh yeah. Learned how to do it when I was living down in Ecuador.

CROWLEY

You've been to Ecuador.

WAITER

I've been all over. If you can fry up a decent burger you can get work anywhere. I'm dying to head to Asia. It's just a dream, you know?

CROWLEY

Funny. I'm in the business of making dreams come true.

[CROWLEY'S phone rings. He answers it.]

CROWLEY

Hello?

DEAN

Hey. I need your help.

CROWLEY

What?

[Static on the other end, then the call drops. CROWLEY looks at his phone.]

CROWLEY

Dean?

[CROWLEY puts the phone down as he gets a text message from Dean, which says "MEET ME. 11979 Cedar Street, Concordia, Kansas, 66901".]

[CUT TO INTERIOR – SHREVEPORT POLICE STATION – DAY]

[DEAN is handcuffed to a chair in front of OFFICER 2's desk at the police station. OFFICER 2 is going through DEAN's box of fake I.D.s. DEAN says nothing, just stares at OFFICER 2 unblinkingly with a murderous look on his face.]

OFFICER 2

Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy Kilmister, Freddy Mercury. Damn. I mean, they said you were a pro, but...

DEAN

Who said that?

OFFICER 2

I'll ask the questions here.

DEAN

Hmm.

OFFICER 2

Like, for example, you got seventeen fake I.D.'s, and a trunk full of guns, knives, freakin' ninja stars... I mean, who are you, man?

DEAN

I'm the guy that's gonna get out of here in about... thirty seconds.

OFFICER 2

(scoffs) Yeah, right.

[DEAN leans forward, staring at OFFICER 2. He reaches out and knocks the mug full of pens off of the desk and onto the floor.]

OFFICER 2

Real mature.

[OFFICER 2 gets up and walks around the desk to pick up the mug. When he leans down, DEAN punches him in the face with his free arm and throws him onto the floor, holding OFFICER 2 on the ground with his legs.]

DEAN

Keys. Keys, now!

[OFFICER 2 reaches around and holds out his keys. DEAN grabs them, and then stomps on OFFICER 2's face with his foot, knocking him unconscious. DEAN then unlocks his handcuffs.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR, OFFICER 1'S OFFICE, SHREVEPORT POLICE STATION – DAY]

[OFFICER 1 is standing at the window talking to someone on his phone. He doesn't realize that DEAN has entered the office and is standing behind him, holding a gun.]

OFFICER 1

He was driving a '67 Impala, just like you said. Sure, can do.

[OFFICER 1 hangs up.]

DEAN

Who're you talking to?

OFFICER 1

(Surprised) Nobody.

[Dean draws his gun, and advances on OFFICER 1.]

DEAN

Nobody?

[DEAN punches OFFICER 1 in the face with the gun.]

DEAN

That is for lying to me, and that – (he punches him again) – is for my baby. Now.

[DEAN throws OFFICER 1 onto the desk and holds him down, gun pointed at his throat.]

DEAN

(yells) Who were you talking to?

OFFICER 2

Monroe Styne. He said if I saw you I was supposed to bring you in. And then call him.

DEAN

Monroe. Any relation to Eldon?

OFFICER 2

His daddy.

DEAN

Where can I find him?

OFFICER 2

You can't take on the Stynes. They own this town. They're practically gods around here.

DEAN

Yeah, well I kill gods.

[CUT TO INTERIOR – ABANDONED BUILDING – DAY]

CROWLEY

Dean? Deeeean?

[CROWLEY looks around. Out of nowhere a gun fires, and CROWLEY collapses against a wall, unable to move, holding his hand over where the bullet entered. SAM emerges from the shadows.]

SAM

Devil's trap bullet.

CROWLEY

Moose! Shooting me from behind. Poor form, even for you. Where's Dean?

SAM

Not here.

CROWLEY

He called me.

SAM

Did he?

[SAM pulls out his phone and plays a recording of Dean saying "Hey, I need your help."]

CROWLEY

Oh. Aren't you a clever kitty? Does he know you're doing this? I only ask because your brother and I, such close friends now.

SAM

Friends. You're the reason Dean has the Mark of Cain! Everything that's happening! All of this. It's your fault! So this.... you've had this coming for a long time.

[CROWLEY sees that SAM is holding Ruby's knife.]

CROWLEY

You really think I'm frightened of that toothpick?

SAM

I don't care.

[SAM reaches into his pocket and pulls out a hex bag. He puts it in CROWLEY's pocket.]

CROWLEY

A hex bag?

SAM

By the way. She said to tell you, she should have taken the three pigs.

CROWLEY

Mother!

[All of a sudden CROWLEY tenses up in pain, eyes wide. He slides down the wall and falls onto the floor, unable to breathe, coughing blood. SAM stands over him, unemotional.]

ACT THREE
[EXTERIOR, NIGHT, STYNE ESTATE, SHREVEPORT]

[A unnamed man steps into the frame, in front of the Styne house. He looks around. Apparently satisfied he is alone, he starts to walk off, but then DEAN jumps him and stabs a knife into his neck, killing him instantly. DEAN leaves him dead on the ground and walks toward the house.

Near the front door, another man is standing guard. He seems to sense something, and walks forward a bit, looking around. When he turns back to face the door, he sees DEAN standing there, with another guy in a headlock, pointing his gun (which has been fitted with a silencer) at him. DEAN shoots both of them dead.

DEAN enters the house, which is dark. Old jazz music is heard. When he reaches the middle of the entrance hall, the room is flooded with light, and what looks to be at least 10 people appear over the stair railings above, all aiming guns at him. MONROE emerges from among them.]

MONROE

Dean Winchester.

[From behind DEAN, ELI pulls a plastic bag over DEAN'S head. He struggles for air.]

MONROE

Welcome to my humble abode.

[CUT TO INTERIOR – ABANDONED BUILDING – DAY]

[CROWLEY is still on the floor.]

CROWLEY

I thought you were the smart one. Working with my mother. Are you insane! You actually trust her?

SAM

'Course not. Not even a little.

CROWLEY

Then why? What has she got over you?

SAM

Will you just die already?

CROWLEY

(coughs, spits blood) That's what I get.

SAM

What?

CROWLEY

I said, that's what I get for trying to be the good guy.

SAM

Wait a second, so you're the good guy?

CROWLEY

Do you have any idea what I've been at for the past year? The changes I made to hell!

SAM

Am I supposed to be impressed by that?

CROWLEY

Yes! (coughs up more blood) I thought if I did better, I might actually feel something again. That it might matter.

SAM

It doesn't matter. Maybe everybody else forgot about all the bad you've done, but I haven't! I have watched you kill people, Crowley. Innocent people! People I cared about, people I loved! So yeah, you have the accent, and the suit, and the snark, but at the end of it, you are a monster! Just like all the rest of them. And I'm gonna watch you die, screaming. Just like all the rest of them.

CROWLEY

You're right. I am a monster. And I've done bad. I've done things you can't even imagine. Horrible, evil, messy things.

[CROWLEY coughs, then turns his head to look up at SAM. His eyes have turned a dark red, and red smoke seems to be emanating from them.]

CROWLEY

And I've loved every. Damn. Minute.

[SAM looks at him, confused, worried. CROWLEY pulls the bullet out from his wound, and stands up.]

CROWLEY

So thank you Sam. For reminding me who I really am.

[CROWLEY flicks his hand sideways and sends SAM flying across the room, smashing through glass windows into the next room. CROWLEY walks over to SAM, holding the hex bag.]

CROWLEY

Powerful magic. Might have worked on any other demon. But me? Please.

[From the ground, SAM watches as the hex bag bursts into flames. He sees Ruby's knife on the ground and tries to reach it, but CROWLEY sends it flying away with a wave of his hand. CROWLEY stands over SAM, with his fingers ready to make a snapping motion. SAM watches him, defenseless, waiting.]

CROWLEY

I could kill you. Snap my fingers, easiest thing in the world.

[CROWLEY lowers his hand.]

CROWLEY

From here on, I want you to know that the only reason you're alive is because I allowed it. And I want you to deliver a message. You tell that ginger whore that I gave her a chance to walk away and she spat in my face. So now, she'll never see me coming.

[CROWLEY vanishes, leaving SAM alone.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR – STYNE BASEMENT]

[DEAN is strapped to the operating table. MONROE, ELI, and several others are gathered around him, preparing their tools. DEAN slowly regains consciousness.]

MONROE

Morning, Sunshine. Monroe Styne. Pleasure.

DEAN

Ditto. I'd shake your hand, but uh...

MONROE

Well I have to say, I am impressed, the way you charged in here, all guns blazin'. I'd buy tickets to that show. You didn't think that was actually gonna work, did you?

DEAN

Usually does.

MONROE

Then I guess you know what comes next.

DEAN

You're gonna play Operation.

MONROE

It is my favorite game.

DEAN

Don't do this.

MONROE

Well, uh, son, we are... we are past the bargaining stage.

DEAN

No. The Mark on my arm means that I can't die. I'm not bargaining. You flatline me, I will come back. But I'll come back with black eyes. And then you'll all die.

ELI

And we'll let you go, then what? You'll just mosey on down the road?

DEAN

No. But I will be human. So maybe a few of you live. Maybe.

MONROE

You make a compelling case, and I hope you're right. Because a man that doesn't die, well now that is a perfect lab rat.

[ELI gags Dean.]

MONROE

Alright. Let's crack this piñata.

[MONROE takes his scalpel and goes to make the first cut. However, DEAN breaks one of his arms free from the restraint and grabs MONROE's arm. He then head-butts him, sits up, grabs a knife, frees his other arm, and fatally slits ELI's throat. The female Styne grabs a syringe and charges DEAN. DEAN grabs her, slams her onto the operating table, and jams the syringe she was holding into her neck, killing her. DEAN then goes after MONROE, grabbing him and throwing him against a door before securing him in a headlock, choking him.]

DEAN

You took something from me. Now I'm gonna take everything from you.

MONROE

It's too late. Your home... your family... they...will...

[DEAN snaps MONROE'S neck and his body falls into a corner. DEAN takes a moment and surveys his handiwork. He then reaches into MONROE's pocket and retrieves a gun. DEAN leaves the room, kicking the door open in a cold fury.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR – THE BUNKER]

[The door of the Bunker is blasted open, and ELDON, CYRUS, and ROSCOE enter, ELDON with his gun drawn.]

ELDON

(Yells) Hello? Anybody in here? (There is no response.) Alright then. Take whatever looks interesting, and burn the rest.

ACT FOUR
[EXT – ABANDONED BUILDING – DAY]

[SAM exits and makes a phone call.]

[CUT TO INT – ROWENA'S HIDEOUT – DAY]

[ROWENA's phone rings. She answers. Scene cuts between SAM and ROWENA.]

SAM

It didn't work.

ROWENA

What do you mean?

SAM

I mean that juiced-up hex bag you gave me. Crowley set it on fire. Looks like you're not as tough as you thought you were.

ROWENA

But you still have him trapped?

SAM

Yeah! Not so much.

ROWENA

Bloody hell.

SAM

What am I supposed to do, Rowena, how am I supposed to kill him?

ROWENA

I'm sure you'll figure something out.

SAM

What?

ROWENA

You've got a job to do, Samuel, you'll get it done! (hangs up)

SAM

Rowena!

[CUT TO INT – STYNE BASEMENT]

[CASTIEL enters, on the phone, calling SAM. SAM answers, still outside the abandoned building.]

SAM

Yeah?

CASTIEL

It's me.

SAM

Hey. Did you find him?

CASTIEL

Not yet. But I'm at the Styne estate in Louisiana, and... Dean was here.

SAM

You sure?

CASTIEL

I'm sure.

SAM

How bad is it?

CASTIEL

There are three bodies down here and more than a dozen upstairs in the main house. He killed... he killed everyone. And brutally.

SAM

(Cringing as he hears this) Alright. I'm on my way.

CASTIEL

No. Don't bother, Sam. The GPS says he's headed North.

SAM

Where?

CASTIEL

Home. Dean's coming home.

[CUT TO INT – THE BUNKER]

[CYRUS walks around, looking at the books, which have been scattered over the floor and piled in the center of the room. He selects one still on the shelf, The Practioner's Guide to Exorcism.]

CYRUS

(opening the book) Cool.

[ROSCOE enters.]

ROSCOE

Hey! This isn't a damn library.

CYRUS

Yeah it is.

ROSCOE

No reading! Box it, or burn it.

CYRUS

Come on! Dude.

ROSCOE

(Hitting Cyrus on the back of the head) I know this is your first rodeo, but man up. Okay? Now I'm gonna go check out their sex dungeon, you stay here and finish up.

CYRUS

(under breath) Douche.

[ROSCOE walks away. CYRUS kneels next to the pile and pulls out a photo of Dean, Sam, and Bobby. ELDON enters carrying a box of Dean's things, and CYRUS puts the photo down.]

ELDON

So this is what I know about Dean Winchester. He's got crappy taste in music, got a hot mom, and he loves flannel. (He throws Dean's things onto the pile and grabs a gasoline container.) Alright, let's light her up.

CYRUS

Eldon, wait. We don't have to.

ELDON

I know, Cy. We get to.

[ELDON pours gasoline on the pile and lights a match. He is about to set the pile on fire, when footsteps are heard. ROSCOE stumbles in, and collapses against a wall, revealing that he has been stabbed in the back.]

ELDON

Roscoe?

[As ROSCOE falls to the floor, dead, ELDON and CYRUS look up to see DEAN walk in, stone-faced and covered in blood spatters.]

ELDON

Well there he is. I hope you brought marshmallows.

DEAN

Been looking for you.

ELDON

Oh yeah? Why is that? Oh wait. You're not still sore about um, what's her name?

DEAN

Charlie. Her name was Charlie.

ELDON

Yeah, well. Chuckie, she got what she deserved. Wanna know how I did her? It's a kinda funny story—

DEAN

Shut up.

ELDON

Straight to it, then. I respect that. See, you got lucky before. This time, I'm sporting some new upgrades. See my old man—

DEAN

Your old man's dead. They're all dead. So you can save me the speech on the three hearts, the two spleens, the seven nipples, for the ladies... or the fellas, I don't judge. But even with all that, you still only have one brain.

ELDON

So?

[DEAN draws his gun and shoots ELDON in the head before he has even realized what happened. ELDON drops dead. DEAN then points the gun at CYRUS.]

CYRUS

No no no no no, don't! Don't!

DEAN

Why not? You're one of them.

CYRUS

(Voice shaking) No. No, I'm not! Okay, I hate my family! See, look! (pulls up shirt) No stitches! I'm not like them, I promise.

DEAN

Oh, you are like them. There's bad in you. It's in your blood. Now you can deny it and you can run from it all you want, but that bad.... will always win.

[CYRUS shakes head, close to tears]

CYRUS

I'll do anything you want. Okay, please. You don't need to do this. (He starts crying in earnest) Please.

[DEAN hesitates.]

DEAN

Yeah. (pause) I do.

[DEAN shoots CYRUS in the head, killing him instantly. A few seconds later, CASTIEL arrives.]

CASTIEL

Dean!

[DEAN turns to face CASTIEL.]

CASTIEL

What have you done?

ACT FIVE
[Shot of SAM in truck, nearing the Bunker.]

[Cut back to DEAN and CASTIEL the Bunker]

[CASTIEL kneels by CYRUS' body]

CASTIEL

You killed him.

DEAN

I took down a monster. Because that's what I do. And I'll continue to do that until...

CASTIEL

Until you become the monster.

DEAN

You can leave now, Cas.

CASTIEL

No. I can't. Because I'm your friend.

DEAN

Really? Well let me ask you something. Do you screw over all your friends?

CASTIEL

Sam and I were trying to cure you! We still are!

DEAN

Like hell.

CASTIEL

We can read the Book now.

DEAN

Oh so what? So you MIGHT find a spell that MIGHT take this crap off my arm? But even if you do, what's it gonna cost? 'Cause magic like that does not come free. No, it comes with a price that you pay in blood. So thanks, but I'm good.

[DEAN turns to leave. CASTIEL grabs his shoulder to stop him.]

CASTIEL

No! You're not. Maybe you could fight the Mark for years. Maybe centuries, like Cain did. But you cannot fight it forever. And when you finally turn, and you will turn... Sam, and everyone you know, everyone you love... they could be long dead. Everyone except me. I'm the one who will have to watch you murder the world. So if there's even a small chance that we can save you, I won't let you walk out of this room.

DEAN

Oh you think you have a choice.

CASTIEL

I think the Mark is changing you.

DEAN

You're wrong.

CASTIEL

Am I? Because the Dean Winchester I know would never have murdered that kid.

DEAN

Yeah well, that Dean's always been kind of a dick.

[DEAN tries to leave again, but CASTIEL stops him.]

CASTIEL

Dean. I don't wanna have to hurt you.

DEAN

I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

[DEAN grabs CASTIEL's hand and wrenches it off of his shoulder, then punches him hard in the face with his other hand.]

CASTIEL

Dean.

[DEAN punches CASTIEL over and over, then throws him on the floor. CASTIEL, bloody, gets up, still trying to stop DEAN from leaving.]

CASTIEL

Dean. Stop.

[DEAN, halfway to the doorway, turns around and launches a new attack on CASTIEL, beating him up worse than before. As CASTIEL lies on the floor, half conscious and coughing up blood, DEAN pulls the angel blade from CASTIEL's coat. He grabs his tie and prepares to stab him. CASTIEL manages to grab DEAN's hand.]

CASTIEL

No, Dean. Please. (He coughs and blood comes up)

[DEAN stares coldly at CASTIEL, holding the angel blade. DEAN strikes with the angel blade, and stands up. A shot of CASTIEL reveals that DEAN has stabbed a book next to CASTIEL's face.]

DEAN

(walking away) You and Sam stay the hell away from me. Next time I won't miss.

[CASTIEL, still on the floor, watches DEAN leave in horror.]

[FADE TO BLACK]
