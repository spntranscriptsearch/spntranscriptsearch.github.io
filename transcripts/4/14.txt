TEASER
INTERIOR. EVENING. WOMAN TENDERIZES MEAT.

Outside the window a man exits his car. He enters the kitchen.

MAN
Hey...What?

WOMAN
Ted's kinda cracking the whip, isn't he?

MAN
You think I like coming home late? I'm working my ass off.

WOMAN
(picking up plate of meat) OK. Sorry.

MAN
(moving to kiss her temple) No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Long day.

WOMAN
(moving about the room) Oh hey, I ran into Jill Martin today. Gary's turning 40 on Saturday.

MAN
Yeah?

WOMAN
She invited us to the party.

MAN
What'd you tell her?

WOMAN
That we'd go.

MAN
(slamming fridge door) You're kidding!

WOMAN
What? You like Gary!

MAN
Yeah. That doesn't mean that I want to waste my Saturday night with him.

WOMAN
I thought you'd want to go.

MAN
(angrily) I don't believe you!

WOMAN
It's fine. I'll call Jill and tell her we can't make it.

WOMAN
(leaning to turn on lamp) What's with you tonight? It's like you wanna have a fight or something.

She turns from the lamp as he lifts the meat cleaver over his head. He strikes her repeatedly. We see blood splattering over their wedding picture.

ACT ONE
TITLE CARD:
SUPERNATURAL

INTERIOR - MOTEL ROOM
Camera pans up a man's body under a blanket in bed. DEAN is sleeping.

SAM (off camera)
Yeah.

A truck horn sounds. Dean wakes. He turns to see SAM is not in his bed.

SAM (off camera)
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you. No storms, no bad crops, nothing.

DEAN leans up on an elbow and watches SAM talk on the phone in the bathroom.

SAM
Yeah, okay. We'll keep looking. You keep looking too, OK?

SAM
All right. Talk soon.

SAM hangs up. DEAN quickly lies down, pretending to sleep.

SAM enters main room, watching DEAN. He pokes him with his bathroom bag.

SAM
Hey. Up and at 'em, kiddo.

DEAN
(rubbing eyes) You're up early. What are you doing?

SAM
Nothing. I was in the can.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
Yeah. You want me to draw you a picture?

DEAN
Nah, I'll pass.

SAM
Found a job. Bedford, Iowa. Guy beat his wife's brains out with a meat tenderizer.

DEAN
Yikes.

SAM
And get this. Third local inside two months to gank his wife. No priors on any of 'em, all happily married.

DEAN
Ahh. Sounds like Ozzie and Harriet.

SAM
(smirking) More like The Shining.

DEAN
All right, well I guess we'd better have a look.

...............................

INT - PRISON INTERVIEW ROOM


MAN
Why does the PD keep sending you guys? I already said I don't want a lawyer.

DEAN
They're lining up the firing squad.

MAN
I'm pleading guilty.

DEAN
All right, look, you don't want us to represent you, that's fine. In fact it's probably not a bad idea, between you and me. We just wanna understand what happened, that's all.

SAM
Mr Benson. Please.

BENSEN
What happened was, I killed my wife. You wanna know why? Because she made plans without asking me.

SAM
Now when it happened, how did you feel? Disoriented, out of control?

DEAN
Like something possessed you to do it?

BENSEN
I knew exactly what I was doing. I was crystal clear.

DEAN
The why'd you do it?

BENSON
I don't know. I loved her. We were happy.

DEAN places some papers on the table and taps them.

DEAN
Nine G's. That's a hefty bill.

BENSON
Where did you get that?

DEAN
Doesn't matter. We have it. See, certain charges, ones you don't want the missus to know...they show up under shady names like 'M & C Entertainment'.

BENSON
I don't know what you're talking about.

DEAN
Like dropping plastic at a nudie bar for instance.

SAM
We just wanna know the truth, Mr Benson.

BENSON
Her name was Jasmine.

SAM
She was a stripper?

DEAN
Dude, her name was Jasmine.

BENSON
I didn't mean for it to happen, I don't like to go to strip bars. My buddy was having a bachelor party, and there she was.

SAM
Jasmine.

BENSON
She came right up to me. And...I dunno, she was just...perfect. Everything that I wanted.

DEAN
Well you pay enough and anybody will be anything.

BENSON
It wasn't about the money. It wasn't even about the sex. It was...I dunno. I....I don't know what it was. It's hard to explain.

SAM
And your wife found out?

BENSON
No, she never had a clue.

SAM
Then why'd you kill her?

BENSON
For Jasmine. She said we would be together forever. If...if only Vicki was...

DEAN
(Under his breath) Muertos.

BENSON
Afterwards, me and Jasmine were supposed to meet and she never showed. I don't know where she lives, I don't know her last name, I don't even know her real first name! I'm an idiot.

SAM
And you didn't think to tell this to the cops?

BENSON
What for? The stripper didn't do it, I did it. And I know what I deserve. The judge doesn't give me the death sentence, I'll just do it myself.

...............................

INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE

A woman sits behind a desk. She tips some tablets from a bottle into her hand. The name on the office door reads Dr. Cara Roberts.

SAM
(enters office as CARA swallows the tablets and rubs her temples) Rough night?

CARA
Fun night. Rough morning.

SAM sniggers.

CARA
Can I help you?

SAM
Ahhh...yes. Um, I'm Special Agent Stiles, FBI. You Doctor Cara Roberts?

CARA
Far as I know.

SAM
You do some work with the Sheriff's department?

CARA
Yeah, when I'm not slogging it through the ER. It's a small town. We multi-task.

SAM
Well, I have some questions about a case. About several cases actually. Do you mind if I sit?

CARA motions SAM to a chair.

SAM
Great. Adam Benson, Jim Wylie, and Steve Snyder.

CARA
Oh yeah, the men who killed their wives?

SAM
You handled their work-ups, right?

CARA
Autopsies for the wives and tox screens for the perps. Two-for-one special.

SAM
You find anything?

CARA
Not really. I mean, c.o.d. on the women was pretty clear. There was nothing unusual in their systems.

SAM
What about the husbands?

CARA
Can I....see your badge again?

CARA looks closely at SAM's badge, and at SAM.

CARA
There was one thing, um, an anomaly in the blood work. And I remember thinking how strange it was that it showed up in all three of the men.

SAM
That what showed up?

CARA
Oxytocin. And their levels were crazy high.

SAM
Ahh. Oxytocin?

CARA
Mm-hmm, it's a hormone that's produced during childbirth, lactation and sex.

SAM
OK.

CARA
People call it the love hormone. Um, you know how it feels when you first fall in love. The whole weak in the knees, tattoo you on my chest thing? That's oxytocin. Of course it eventually fades and then you're stuck with every relationship ever. That and the painful regime of tattoo removal.

SAM and CARA smile at each other.

DEAN enters.

DEAN
What'd I miss?

SAM
(To CARA) Ahh, this is my partner, Agent Murdoch.

DEAN
(holding out his hand) Please, "Agent" sounds so formal. You can call me Dean.

CARA
(shaking his hand briskly) I'm Doctor Roberts.

CARA
(Turns back to SAM) So, um, can I help you with anything else?

SAM
Uhh, sure, just one more thing. This chemical, this...

CARA
Oxytocin.

SAM
Oxytocin. What would cause those high levels that you found?

CARA
Nothing that I've ever seen.

SAM
OK. That's it. Thanks Doc.

SAM and CARA exchange smiles again. The boys move to the door. Dean moves through, Sam hesitates then turns back.

SAM
By the way...try a greasy breakfast. Best thing for a hangover.

CARA
(Smiling) Watch it buddy, I'm the only M.D. here.

Outside CARA's office DEAN and SAM walk away.

DEAN
Dude, you totally C-blocked me.

.....................

DEAN and SAM are leaving the hospital.

SAM
So Whylie and Snyder totally fessed up, huh?

DEAN
One emptied his IRA, the other, his kids' college fund, all on the same day.

SAM
Live nude girls?

DEAN
A club called 'The Honey Wagon'.

SAM
These guys have affairs too, with a stripper also known as Jasmine?

DEAN
Yes and no. This is where it gets interesting. Each guy hooked up with a different chick.

SAM
So, what? These girls all connected somehow?

DEAN
Well, they all described their stripper in the same way, the exact same way. Perfect, and everything that they wanted.

SAM
Yeah, at least until dream Barbie convinced them to murder their wives.

DEAN
There's that.

SAM
You know, it's almost like they were under some kinda love spell.

DEAN
Sure seems that way.

SAM
Which caused them to become totally psychotic.

DEAN
Absolutely.

SAM
You seem pretty cheery.

DEAN
Strippers, Sammy. Strippers. We're on an actual case involving strippers. Finally.

................................

EXT. THE HONEY WAGON BAR

DEAN shows his badges to security and enters the club.

................................

INT. THE HONEY WAGON BAR

'Thunder Kiss '65' by White Zombie is playing.

DEAN
(To the manager) I'm looking for three girls. Jasmine, Aurora and Ariel.

MANAGER
You seriously think those names mean anything to me?

DEAN
One's a redhead about 5'9". The other one's Asian, about...

MANAGER
You have any idea how many girls I deal with? Fake names, fake hair, fake...

DEAN
You gotta have some sort of paperwork. Cheque stubs. Some way to keep track of the strippers.

MANAGER
Please, exotic dancers. Independent contractors working for cash. I stay out of their hair, they stay out of what little I have left.

DEAN
Three of your customers murdered their wives. You don't think that that's weird?

MANAGER
Yeah. I think that's super-friggin' weird. But you know what it ain't? My problem.

The manager leaves. DEAN sees SAM and walks over to him.

SAM
Any luck?

DEAN
No. You?

SAM
A little. I just talked to Bobby, we officially have a theory.

DEAN
What's that?

SAM
Siren.

DEAN
Like Greek myth siren, the Odessy? (SAM gives DEAN a surprised look)....Hey, I read!

SAM
Yeah, actually. But the siren's not actually a myth, it's more of a beautiful creature that preys on men, enticing them with their siren song.

DEAN
Let me guess, 'Welcome to the Jungle?' No, no. Warrant's 'Cherry Pie.'

SAM
Their song is more of a metaphor, like...like their call, their allure, you know?

DEAN
So they shake their thing and the guys zombie out.

SAM
Basically, yeah. Sirens lived on islands, sailors would chase 'em, completely ignoring the rocky shores...and dash themselves to pieces.

DEAN
Sounds like Adam and his buddies.

SAM
Yeah. If you were a siren in '09 looking to ruin a bunch of morons, where would you set up shop?

DEAN
So whatever floats the guy's boat, that's what they look like?

SAM
Yeah. You see, sirens can read minds. They see what you want most and then they can kinda, like, cloak themselves. You know, like an illusion.

DEAN
So it could all be the same chick? Morphing into, uh, to different dream girls?

SAM
Yeah, actually. Probably. Sirens are usually pretty solitary.

DEAN
How do we kill it?

SAM
Bobby's working on it. Even if we figure that out...

DEAN
How the hell are we gunna find it? It could be anybody.

...........................

Camera pans to a young man sitting in a booth. A stripper approaches.

LENNY
Hey, Belle.

BELLE
(taking his hand and leading him out of the bar) I thought you'd never come.

...........................

INT. APARTMENT.
Lenny looks in on someone sleeping, then closes the door.

LENNY
(To Belle) It's OK, she's asleep.

BELLE
Lenny, you're amazing. Taking care of her like this? Most guys would have put her in a nursing home.

LENNY
It's no big deal. She's my mom.

BELLE
Like I said. Amazing.

They have sex on the couch. The camera shows BELLE's reflection in the mirror as a haggard monster.

Afterwards

BELLE
Baby. I love you so much. The way you take care of me and your mom. You're so sweet. And strong. I just wish you didn't have to carry it all. I mean, your mom takes up all your time. As long as she's around we can't really be happy.

LENNY
She's not so bad.

BELLE
I could be with you, forever. If only your mom wasn't here. Don't you wanna be with me forever?

LENNY
Yeah. Yeah, you know I do.

BELLE
Then bash your mother's brains in. Baby, do it for me. Do it, baby.

LENNY
Yeah. OK. If you say so.

BELLE
I love you.

Lenny takes a poker from the fireplace and walks to his mother's room. Striking sounds and cries are heard.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
INT. MOTEL ROOM

DEAN is alone. He stares at, then picks up, Sam's phone and scrolls to an unknown number. He rings it.

RUBY
(on phone) Hey, Sam.....Sam?... You there...?

DEAN quickly hangs up, looking upset.

SAM enters.

SAM
Lenny Bristol was definitely another siren vic.

DEAN
You get in to see him?

SAM
Yep. He bought home a stripper named Belle. Coupla hours later he offed his mother. Belle, of course, went MIA.

DEAN
Wait, he killed his mom?

SAM
The woman he was closest too.

SAM's phone rings.

DEAN
Yeah, you, uh, forgot your cell phone.

DEAN tosses SAM his phone.

SAM
(giving Dean a worried look) Hey Bobby.

BOBBY
Sam. You find her yet?

SAM
Ahhh, no. And, uh, it doesn't seem like she's slowing down any. You got anything?

BOBBY
Well, some lore from a dusty Greek poem. Shockingly, it's a little vague.

SAM
Hold on a sec, I'll put you on speaker.

BOBBY
It says you need "a bronze dagger, covered in the blood of a sailor, under the spell of the song".

DEAN
What the hell does that mean?

BOBBY
You got me. We're dealing with 3000 years of the telephone game here.

SAM
Best guess?

BOBBY
Well, the siren's spell ain't got nothing to do with any song. It's most likely some kind of toxin or venom. Something she gets in the vic's blood.

SAM
And makes them go all Manchurian Candidate. Uh, what do you think, she infects the men during sex?

BOBBY
Maybe.

DEAN
Supernatural STD.

BOBBY
Well, however it happens, once it's done the siren's gotta watch her back. She gets a dose of her own medicine...

SAM
It kills her.

BOBBY
Like a snake getting iced by its own venom.

DEAN
So we just gotta find a way to juice one of the OJs in jail?

BOBBY
Not that easy. None of those guys are under the spell anymore. Haven't got a clue where you're going to get the blood you need.

SAM
I think I might have an idea.

BOBBY
Be careful. These things are tricky bitches. Wrap you up in knots before you know what hit ya.

...................

INT. HOSPITAL

SAM
Dr. Roberts.

CARA
Agent Stiles. Can't stay away, huh?

SAM
Actually, uh, we're here on business. About the blood samples. The ones with the high...you know...oxytocin?

DEAN
You still have them?

CARA
Mm-hmm.

DEAN
Good, we need them.

CARA
What for?

MAN
(approaching) Excuse me, Dr. Roberts?

CARA
Yeah?

DEAN
(getting out his FBI badge) Excuse me, uh, we're a little busy here, buddy.

MAN
(getting out his own FBI badge) Yeah, so am I, pal.

SAM
Doc, can you give us a sec, please?

CARA
(Backing away) Sure.

SAM
Thanks.

DEAN
What's your name?

STRANGER
Nick Munroe. What's yours?

SAM
I'm Special Agent Sam Stiles, this is my partner Dean Murdoch. What office are you from?

MUNROE
Omaha, Violent Crimes Unit. My SAC sent me down here to see about the murders.

SAM
Hmm.

MUNROE
You?

DEAN
D.C. Our Assistant Director assigned us.

MUNROE
Oh, which AD?

SAM
Mike Kaiser.

MUNROE
What are your badge numbers?

DEAN
You're kidding, right?

MUNROE
I'm just following protocol.

SAM
(handing MUNROE a card) Look man, whatever. Just call our AD, he'll sort things out.

MUNROE dials the number.

VOICE ON PHONE
D.C. Bureau.

MUNROE
Yeah, Assistant Director Kaiser, please.

VOICE
Well, that would be me. What can I do for you?

MUNROE
Yes, sir. Hello. It's Agent Nick Munroe. I'm calling about two of your men. Stiles and Murdoch? Uh, it seems that they've been put on my case by mistake?

BOBBY
(on other end of line, frying his lunch) Are you questioning my authority?

MUNROE
No, no, no, sir. I'm not questioning...

BOBBY
You coulda fooled me. Last time I checked, son, D.C. has jurisdiction. Or am I wrong?

MUNROE
Ahhh, no sir.

BOBBY
Well, good. Well, the next time you wanna waste my time with stupid questions, don't.

BOBBY hangs up phone along a line of phones marked Fed Marshall, FBI, CIA, etc.

BOBBY
Oh, those idiots.

Munroe
(moving back to DEAN and SAM) I'm sorry, guys.

DEAN
Just don't let it happen again.

MUNROE
Where are you at with this?

DEAN
Where are you at with this?

MUNROE
Well, I was just about to run the, uh, perps' bloodwork.

SAM
I already checked, dead end.

MUNROE
Oh yeah?

SAM
Yeah.

MUNROE
But get this. I feel like I found something that, uh, connects all the murderers.

SAM
Really?

MUNROE
(nodding) They were all banging strippers....from the same club.

DEAN
You don't say!

MUNROE
What do you say we, uh, go down there and check it out?

DEAN
Well, here's the thing, Nick. See, we're kinda lone wolves...

SAM
You know what, that sounds like an excellent idea. Just... just give me a second with my partner and we'll, uh...one sec. (SAM to DEAN) Come here.

SAM
Dude, you gotta stay with him.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Keep him outta the way.

DEAN
Why me?

SAM
'Cause I gotta get the blood samples.

DEAN
What the hell am I supposed to do with him?

SAM
Just take him to the strip club...keep an eye out for the siren. Come on, Dean, just... just focus on the naked girls. You'll forget he's even there!

DEAN
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for the girls.

...............

EXT. CARPARK OF HOSPITAL

DEAN
All right, we're taking my ride, no complaining about the tunes.

MUNROE
No way. You drive an Impala?

DEAN
Yeah.

MUNROE
It's a '67, right? It's a 327 four barrel.

DEAN
Yeah, actually.

MUNROE
It's a thing of beauty.

DEAN
Thanks.

MUNROE
How the hell did you talk the Bureau into letting you drive your own wheels?

.................

INT. HOSPITAL

CARA
You want this blood because...

SAM
Uh, we'd like to run some tests.

CARA
You know, I've run every test there is. It's, um, my job. Notice the lab coat.

SAM
We know a specialist who'd like to try out a theory.

CARA
(moving to cabinet) If you say so.

CARA
(sliding out a tray of test tubes) What the hell?

SAM
What?

CARA
The blood's gone.

......................

INT. STRIP CLUB
Music Steal the World by Brian Tichy. DEAN and MUNROE are drinking shots at a table.

DEAN
Nobody's Fault But Mine.

MUNROE
Zeppelin recorded it in '75. It was a cover of a Blind Willie Johnson tune.

DEAN
Nice.

MUNROE
You Shook Me.

DEAN
'69, debut album, written by Willie Dixon.

MUNROE
And....?

DEAN
And what?

MUNROE
Written by Willie Dixon and J.B. Lenoir.

DEAN
Dude. Dude! You know, for a fed, you're not a total dick.

MUNROE
Aren't we both feds?

DEAN
Yeah, I know, I just...you know, not a lot of feds are as cool as us, huh?

MUNROE
So what the hell with this case, man? How does a girl talk four different johns into murder?

DEAN
It's a crazy world.

MUNROE
I guess. Hey, can I level with you?

DEAN
Mmm.

MUNROE
I found something kinda weird.

DEAN
Well. You have bought your weird to the right spot. Lay it on me.

MUNROE
I went to the crime scene this morning. Saw them bagging this up. (Hands DEAN some purple petals in a plastic bag). So I went back, uh, through all the files. It turns out a flower just like that was found at every crime scene.

DEAN
Like it was left on purpose?

MUNROE
You know, sometimes a serial killer will leave an object behind, like a calling card. But with this case? Tell you the truth, I got no idea what's going on.

DEAN
I think I might. I've seen a flower like this before.

........................

INT. HOSPITAL
CARA
We've watched them twice. Whoever took the blood...

SAM
Must have tampered with the tapes. Who has access to your office?

CARA
Everybody. I don't lock it.

SAM
You what?

CARA
I've never had this problem before. What is so important about the blood anyway?

SAM
I think someone drugged the men, made them commit murder.

CARA
What? What kind of drug?

SAM
Ahh, I'm not sure yet.

CARA
I don't know. I mean, I interviewed those guys and they had their reasons.

SAM
Yeah but they all loved their victims.

CARA
I'm sure they did. Come on. Haven't you ever been in a relationship where you really love somebody and still kinda wanted to bash their head in?

SAM
Sounds like you're speaking from experience.

CARA
Yeah.

SAM
Look, I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.

CARA
It's OK. I was the one who bought it up.

CARA opens a bottle of whiskey and pours two glasses.

SAM
(Looking at the whiskey) Really?

CARA
It's medicine. I'm a doctor.

CARA
His name was Karl. We were married.

They clink glasses.

SAM
So what happened?

CARA
Life happened. I don't know. I mean I loved him. Still do I guess but...I don't know. It's like one day I looked up and I was living with a stranger and...you know what I mean, right?

SAM
I guess. Or, I don't know, maybe.

CARA
People change. I know I did. But it's nothing to feel guilty about. It happens.

SAM
So you two split up?

CARA
I suppose that's a word for it.

SAM's phone rings. He looks at the number.

CARA
Do you need to get that?

Sam
Nope. Not right now.

CARA pours them both another drink.

CARA
Whatever. We've all got our own sad stories, so... screw it. Have fun, no regrets and live life like there's no tomorrow.

They clink glasses again.

CARA
(Moving closer) For instance, I have been thinking about you, all night. Well, parts of you.

SAM
Just parts?

CARA
Mmm-hmmm. Like your lips. They're very distracting. It's a problem. And I can't stop thinking about kissing them.

SAM
That so?

CARA So....what the hell, huh?

They have sex against the window, next to a bunch of the same flowers MUNROE had given DEAN earlier.

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. MOTEL HALLWAY

SAM walks down the hall and enters their room. It is empty. He gets out his phone.

DEAN
(Driving) Sam! Where the hell have you been?

SAM
With Cara.

DEAN
Oh, it's Cara now? And you're not picking up your phone?

SAM
We were trying to find the blood samples – someone stole 'em.

DEAN
Yeah, I bet!

SAM
What's that supposed to mean?

DEAN
Nick found flower petals at the crime scenes. Hyacinths.

SAM
So?

DEAN
Hyacinths? Mediterranean. From the island where the whole friggin' siren myth started in the first place.

SAM
OK.

DEAN
Sam, Cara had hyacinth flowers!

SAM
You think Cara's the siren?

DEAN
Well, I did a little checking up on her. She's only been in town for two months.

SAM
Yeah. And?

DEAN
And she has an ex-husband. A dead ex-husband, Carl Roberts. Dropped like a stone, no warning. Supposedly a heart attack.

SAM
Well, maybe it was a heart attack.

DEAN
You're kidding me.

SAM
Look, I just don't think it's her.

DEAN
And what makes you so sure?

SAM
I dunno, a hunch.

DEAN
A hunch? I'm giving you cold hard facts here and you're giving me a hunch?

A few seconds of loaded silence.

DEAN
Did you sleep with her?

SAM
No.

DEAN
Holy crap. You did. Middle of Basic Instinct and you bang Sharon Stone? Sam, you could be under her spell right now!

SAM
Dude, I'm not under her spell.

DEAN
Unbelievable, man. I just don't get it.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Nothing.

SAM
No. Say it.

DEAN
No, It's just...first it's Madison, and then Ruby, and now Cara. It's like... what is with you and banging monsters?

SAM
Dean, I'm telling you, it's not Cara. I feel fine.

DEAN
I'll bet you do.

SAM
You don't trust me?

DEAN
No. Because this could be the siren talking.

SAM
Look, tell me where you are, I'll come meet you and we'll figure things out.

DEAN
No.

SAM
Are you serious?

DEAN
I wish I weren't. I gotta handle this, Sam. By myself.

They hang up. Sam throws his phone across the room.

...................

DEAN
(in Impala on phone) Sam's in trouble, Bobby. I think the siren's worked her mojo on him. Give me a call as soon as you get this.

Dean hangs up and immediately makes another call.

MUNROE
Hey man, what's up?

DEAN
I need your help.

MUNROE
Uh, sure. With what?

DEAN
Canvassing. We gotta find somebody.

...............

MUNROE sits in his car outside a bar. He watches Cara get out of a taxi and walk inside.

DEAN slides into MUNROE's passenger seat.

MUNROE
She went in just a second ago.

DEAN
Nice work.

MUNROE
Should we follow her in?

DEAN
No, no, no, I don't wanna tip her off. Let's just wait and see who she comes out with.

MUNROE
So you think... what? She's drugging these guys?

DEAN
Pretty much.

MUNROE
Uh-huh.

DEAN
I know how it sounds.

MUNROE
You sure about that? 'Cause it sounds like crazy on toast. All these different strippers, they're magically the same girl? But then they're not strippers at all, it's Dr Quinn.

DEAN
It's kinda hard to explain, but I have my reasons and they're good ones, so you're just gunna have to trust me on 'em.

MUNROE
Yeah. OK. I guess.

DEAN
(Surprised) Thank you. That's actually nice to hear.

DEAN takes a swig from his hip flask and offers it to MUNROE. MUNROE drinks and hands it back. DEAN takes another swig.

MUNROE
So let's say she is drugging her vics. How's she pulling that off?

DEAN
She could be injecting them, you know, or passing the toxin through, uh, physical contact.

MUNROE
Or it could be her saliva...You really should have wiped the lip of that thing before you drank from it, Dean. (A look of realization crosses DEAN's face). I should be your little brother. Sam. You can't trust him. Not like you can trust me. (MUNROE's reflection in the rear vision mirror is that of a monster.) In fact, I really feel like you should get him outtta the way, so we can be brothers. Forever.

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. MOTEL ROOM

SAM enters. MUNROE is sitting on the bed.

SAM
Nick. What are you doing here?

DEAN jumps SAM and holds a knife to his throat.

SAM
Dean?

SAM
(to MUNROE) I gotta tell ya, you're one butt ugly stripper.

MUNROE
Well, maybe. But I got exactly what I wanted. I got Dean.

SAM
Dean, come on man, this isn't you. You can fight this. Let me go.

MUNROE
(To DEAN) Why don't you cut him? Just a little, on his neck right there.

DEAN slices SAM'S neck.

MUNROE
Dean's all mine.

SAM
You poisoned him.

MUNROE
No. I gave him what he needed. And it wasn't some bitch in a G-string. It was you. A little brother that looked up to him, that he could trust. And now he loves me. He'd do anything for me. And I gotta tell you, Sam, that kind of devotion? I mean, watching someone kill for you? It's the best feeling in the world.

SAM
Is that why you're slutting all over town?

MUNROE
Ahh. I get bored, like we all do. And I wanna fall in love again. And again...and again.

SAM
I'll tell you what. I have fought some nasty sons of bitches, but you are one needy pathetic loser.

MUNROE
You won't feel that way in a minute.

MUNROE grabs SAM's cheeks and squirts toxin from his mouth onto SAM's lips and chin.

MUNROE
So I know you two have a lot you wanna get off your chests. So why don't you discuss it? And whoever survives can be with me forever.

SAM and DEAN turn to face each other.

DEAN
Well, I don't know when it happened. Maybe when I was in hell. Maybe when I was staring right at you. But the Sam I knew, he's gone.

SAM
That so?

DEAN
And it's not the demon blood or the psychic crap. It's the little stuff. The lies. The secrets.

SAM
Oh, yeah? What secrets?

DEAN
The phone calls to Ruby for one.

SAM
So I need your say-so to make a phone call?

DEAN
That's the point. You're hiding things from me. What else aren't you telling me?

SAM
None of your business.

DEAN
See what I mean? We used to be in this together. We used to have each other's backs.

SAM
OK, fine. You know why I didn't tell you about Ruby, and how we're hunting down Lilith? Because you're too weak to go after her, Dean. You're holding me back. I'm a better hunter than you are. Stronger, smarter. I can take out demons you're too scared to go near.

DEAN
That's crap.

SAM
You're too busy sitting around feeling sorry for yourself. Whining about all the souls you tortured in hell. Boo hoo.

Dean and Sam start fighting, trading many punches.

SAM
You're not standing in my way anymore.

DEAN runs at SAM. They crash through the door onto the hallway floor. DEAN gets up while SAM lies on the ground. DEAN breaks the emergency glass and gets an axe, then stands staring down at SAM.

MUNROE
Do it. Do it for me, Dean.

DEAN
(to SAM) Tell me again how weak I am, Sam, huh? How I hold you back?

DEAN swings the axe over his head as SAM covers his face with his arm.

At the top of the swing the axe is grabbed as BOBBY steps in. He jabs Dean in the shoulder with a bronze knife, making him cry out.

MUNROE begins to run down the hall. BOBBY raises the knife.

SAM
No. NO!

BOBBY flings the knife. It hits MUNROE square in the back. As he falls, dead, his siren reflection is shown in a mirror.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. Leaning against cars. BOBBY hands drinks around.

SAM
Thanks.

DEAN
Soda?

BOBBY
You boys are driving, aren't ya?

SAM
Thanks, Bobby. You know, if you hadn't shown up when you did...

BOBBY
Done the same for me, more than once. Course, you coulda picked up the phone. Only took one call to figure out that Agent Nick Munroe wasn't real.

Awkward silence.

BOBBY
You boys gunna be OK?

SAM
Yeah, fine.

DEAN
Yeah, good.

BOBBY tips his hat and heads back over to his car.

BOBBY
See ya. (He pauses and turns back to SAM and DEAN.) You know, those sirens are nasty things. That it got to you, that's no reason to feel bad.

BOBBY gets in his car and drives away. The boys sip their drinks.
DEAN
You gunna say goodbye to Cara?

SAM
Nah, not interested.

DEAN
Really? Why not?

SAM
What's the point?

DEAN
Well, look at you. Love 'em and leave 'em.

SAM
Dean, look, you know I didn't mean the things I said back there, right? That it was just the siren's spell talking?

DEAN
Of course, me too.

More silence.

SAM
'Kay. So... so we're good?

DEAN
Yeah, we're good.

They enter the car.
