TEASER
EXT. SIDEWALK - IN FRONT OF ALICE'S APARTMENT BUILDING

RUSSEL First date.

ALICE I had a really good time tonight, Russell.

RUSSEL Alice...Can I see you again? Sunday, maybe? I just don't want to be alone on Valentine's day...Again.

ALICE I know what you mean.

(Russel leans in and kisses Alice. They kiss again more passionately and Alice pulls back)

ALICE I'm sorry. I just - I - I don't want you to think I'm the type of person who--

RUSSEL No, I should apologize--

ALICE Mm!

(Alice kisses Russel again)

INT. ALICE'S APARTMENT

(Alice and Russel are kissing)

RUSSEL Ugh! Oh, god. I respect the crap out of you right now.

ALICE Shut up!

(she bites Russel)

RUSSEL Ah! Ugh!

ALICE Your neck! I think I bit you.

RUSSELL It's okay.It's good

ALICE Ugh! I've been so alone. So empty...

RUSSEL I know. Me too.

ALICE I want you, Russel---All of you... inside me...

(they both take bites out of each other, Alice chewing on a piece of Russel's flesh)

RUSSEL Yes. Ugh!

ALICE Aah! Ugh!

ACT I
INT. ALICE'S APARTMENT -DAY

SAM So...you were the one who found the bodies?

ALICE'S ROOMMATE There was blood everywhere...and... other stuff...I think Alice was already dead.

SAM But Russell wasn't?

ALICE'S ROOMMATE I think he was, mostly, except... he was still sort of...chewing a little.

SAM Oh. Uh-huh.

ALICE'S ROOMMATE How do two people even do that--Eat each other to death?

SAM That's a really good question. Now, the last few days, did you notice her acting erratically?

ALICE'S ROOMMATE How do you mean?

SAM I mean, did she seem...unusually hostile, aggressive?

ALICE'S ROOMMATE No way. Alice never drank, never even swore. She was a nice girl. And I'm talking, like, a nice girl--Like she still had her promise ring, if you know what I mean.

SAM She was a virgin?

ALICE'S ROOMMATE No premarital. I used to wonder how she did it. I mean, you know, didn't do it. It was her first date in months. She was so excited.

SAM Apparently, they were both pretty excited.

INT. MOTEL ROOM ( Sam enters with bags of fast food)

DEAN How'd it go?

SAM Um...No EMF, no sulfur. Ghost possession and demonic possession are both probably out.

DEAN Hmm. That's where I was puttin' my money.

SAM Nope.

DEAN (rubbing his eyes) Well, then what, then? Oh, dude! At the coroner's-- you didn't see these bodies. I mean, these two started eating a- and they just... kept going. I mean, their stomachs were full. Like - like...Thanksgiving-dinner full. Talk about co-dependent.

SAM Well...I mean, we got our feelers out. Not much more we can do tonight. All right. I'm just gonna go through some files. You can go ahead and get going.

DEAN Sorry?

SAM Go ahead. Unleash the kraken. See you tomorrow morning.

DEAN Where am I going?

SAM Dean, it's Valentine's day. Your favorite holiday, remember? I mean, what do you always call it-- Uh, unattached drifter Christmas?

DEAN Oh, yeah. Well... be that as it may...I don't know. Guess I'm not feeling it this year.

SAM So you're not into bars full of lonely women?

DEAN Nah, I guess not. ( takes a sip of his beer) Ahh. What?

SAM That's when a dog doesn't eat-- That's when you know something's really wrong.

DEAN Remarkably patronizing concern duly noted. Nothing's wrong. We gonna work or what?

(Dean joins Sam at the table, Sam eyes Dean worriedly)

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

BRAD (looking at some papers) Ouch! No me gusta. Have you been proofing this thing, Jimbo?

JIM Sorry?

BRAD Tell me you are not checking your cellphone again! Man, she's got you on a leash.

JIM I'm not on a leash, Brad. She just wants to know where I am.

BRAD She just wants to know that you're whipped.

JIM It's not like that.

BRAD Oh, yeah. It's like...(makes a whip-crack sound and gesture)

JIM Brad, just give me two minutes.

BRAD No, man. No. I'm the project leader on this thing, and I'm not gonna half-ass it just 'cause my wingman has gone mental over some chick he met, like, a week ago.

JANICE Jim? (crying)

BRAD Holy crap.

JANICE Where were you?

JIM I know. It's just I had to--

JANICE You can't choose work over me, Jim!

JIM I won't, Janice. I'm sorry--

BRAD Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Jimbo, due respect, but honestly, bro--(makes whip crack sound)

(without looking at him, Janice shoots Brad in the heart. He falls backward in his chair, dead )

JANICE What are we gonna do, Jimmy?

JIM I don't know, baby. Seems like whatever we do, something in life is always gonna keep us apart-- Work, family, sleep.

JANICE Now prison, maybe...

JIM Maybe. But I think I have an idea...How we can stay together...forever...

(they bring Janice's gun to her chin and aim in toward her head. A shot rings out, followed by another)

INT. ST. JAMES MEDICAL CENTER

(a bald man in a suit passes, Sam hears his heart beating and turns, watching him with an odd expression. Sam sniffs the air. )

DEAN You okay?

SAM Yeah, I'm fine.

DR. CORMAN Agent Marley, you just can't stay away.

DEAN Heard you tagged another double suicide.

DR. CORMAN Well, I just finished closing them up.

DEAN Dr. Corman, (gesturing to Sam) this is my partner, special agent Cliff.

DR. CORMAN Agent Cliff. I've finished my prelims. I pulled the organ sets and sent off the tox samples.

SAM Great. You mind if we take a look at the bodies?

DR. CORMAN Not at all. But like I said -their... Good-and-plenties are already tupperwared.

SAM Super.

DR. CORMAN Leave the keys with Marty up front. And please, gentlemen...refrigerate after opening...

DEAN Hey. (hands Sam one of the hearts they're examining) Be my Valentine?

SAM Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. These hearts both have identical marks. Check this out. It looks like some kind of letter. Oh, no.

DEAN What?

SAM I think it's Enochian.

DEAN You mean like angel scratches? So you think it's like the tagging on our ribs?

SAM Dean, I don't know.

DEAN Ah, hell. (on the phone) Cas, it's Dean. Yeah, room 31-c, basement level...St. James medical center.

CASTIEL (also on a phone) I'm there now.

DEAN Yeah, I get that.

CASTIEL I'm gonna hang up now.

DEAN Right.

CASTIEL (picking up one of the hearts) You're right, Sam. These are angelic marks. I imagine you'll find similar marks on the other couples' hearts as well--

SAM So, what are they? I mean, what do they mean?

CASTIEL It's a mark of union. This man and woman were intended to mate.

DEAN Okay, but who put them there?

CASTIEL Well, your people call them "Cupid. "

SAM A what?

CASTIEL What human myth has mistaken for "Cupid" is actually a lower order of angel. Technically it's a cherub, third-class.

DEAN Cherub?

CASTIEL Yeah, they're all over the world. There are dozens of them.

DEAN You mean the little flying fat kid in diapers?

CASTIEL They're not incontinent.

SAM Okay, anyway. So, what you're saying--

CASTIEL What I'm saying is a Cupid has gone rogue and we have to stop him--before he kills again.

SAM Naturally.

DEAN Of course we do.

INT. RESTAURANT

(the waitress brings Dean a cheeseburger and Sam a salad)

DEAN (to Castiel) So, what, you just happen to know he likes the cosmos at this place?

CASTIEL This place is a nexus of human reproduction. It's exactly the kind of-(Castiel watches Dean put ketchup on his cheeseburger) -of garden the Cupid will come to-- to pollinate.

(Dean puts his cheeseburger back down)

SAM Wait a minute. You're not hungry?

DEAN No. What? I'm not hungry.

CASTIEL Then you're not gonna finish that? (takes Dean's cheeseburger.)( looking toward a couple at a table across the room) He's here.

SAM Where? I don't see anything.

CASTIEL There.

DEAN You mean the same-side-of-the-booth couple over there?

CASTIEL Meet me in the back.

INT. RESTAURANT - BACK ROOM

SAM Cas, where is he?

CASTIEL I have him tethered. Zoda kama mahrana. Manifest yourself.

DEAN So, where is he?(Cupid appears and grabs Dean in a hug ) Oof!

CUPID Here I am!

ACT II
DEAN Help!

CUPID Oh, help is on the way. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Hello, you! (drops Dean and walks to Castiel)

(Cupid picks Castiel up, hugging him)

CASTIEL Ooh. Mmm.

DEAN This is Cupid?

CASTIEL Yes.

CUPID (to Sam) And look at you, huh?

SAM No. (Sam turns away but Cupid appears in front of him, hugging him too)

CUPID Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

DEAN Is this a fight? Are we in a fight?

CASTIEL This is... Their handshake.

DEAN I don't like it.

CASTIEL No one likes it.

CUPID Mmm. What can I do for you?

CASTIEL Why are you doing this?

CUPID Doing what?

CASTIEL Your targets-- the ones you've marked--They're slaughtering each other.

CUPID What? They are?

DEAN Listen, birthday suit, we know, okay? We know you been flittin' around, popping people with your poison arrow, making them murder each other!

CASTIEL What we don't know is why.

CUPID You think that I--Well, uh...I don't know what to say. (Cupid cries)

SAM Should...Should somebody maybe... go talk to him?

DEAN Yeah, that's a good idea. Give 'em hell, Cas.

CASTIEL Um... look. We didn't mean to, um...hurt your feelings.

(Cupid hugs Castiel)

CASTIEL Ugh!

CUPID Love is more than a word to me, you know. I love love. I love it! And if that's wrong, I don't want to be right!

CASTIEL Yes, yes. Of course. I, uh...I have no idea what you're saying.

CUPID I was just on my appointed rounds. Whatever my targets do after that that's nothing to do with me. I- I was following my orders. Please brother. Read my mind. Read my mind, you'll see.

(Castiel reads Cupid's mind)

CASTIEL He's telling the truth.

CUPID Jiminy Christmas. Thank you.

DEAN Wait, wait, you said--You said you were just following orders?

CUPID Mm-hmm.

DEAN Whose orders?

CUPID Whose? (laughing) Heaven, silly. Heaven.

DEAN Why does heaven care if Harry meets Sally?

CUPID Oh, mostly they don't. You know, certain bloodlines, certain destinies. Oh, like yours.

SAM What?

CUPID Yeah, the union of John and Mary Winchester--Very big deal upstairs, top priority arrangement. Mm.

DEAN Are you saying that you fixed-up our parents?

CUPID Well, not me, but... Yeah. Well, it wasn't easy, either. Ooh, they couldn't stand each other at first. But when we were done with them--Perfect couple.

DEAN Perfect?

CUPID Yeah.

DEAN They're dead!

CUPID I'm sorry, but... the orders were very clear. You and Sam needed to be born. Your parents were just, uh...meant to be. (sings) A match made in heaven- heaven!

(Dean punches Cupid)

DEAN Son of a bitch!

(Cupid disappears)

DEAN Where is he? Where'd he go?!

CASTIEL I believe you upset him.

DEAN Upset him?!

SAM Dean. Enough!

DEAN What?

SAM You just punched a Cupid!

DEAN I punched a dick!

SAM Um...Are we gonna talk about what's been up with you lately or not?

DEAN Or not.

INT. ST. JAMES MEDICAL CENTER

DR. CORMAN You said you wanted to hear about any other weird ones.

SAM Okay.

(Dr. Corman walks to a gurney and shows Sam a corpse - the corpse's belly is distended)

DR. CORMAN Lester Finch. Pulled his records. Looks like this gentleman used to weigh 400 pounds or so, till he got a gastric bypass, which brought down his weight considerably. But then for some reason, last night, he decided to go on a twinkie binge.

SAM So, he died from a twinkie binge?

DR. CORMAN Well, after he blew out the band around his stomach, he filled it up till it burst. When he could no longer swallow, he started jamming the cakes down his gullet with a...with a toilet brush, like he was ramrodding a cannon.

SAM So, what do you make of it?

DR. CORMAN I'd say that it was a very peculiar thing to do...(Dr. Corman takes a drink from his flask)

EXT. STREET - FRONT OF ST. JAMES MEDICAL CENTER

SAM (on the phone) Hey. So, uh, this guy was not marked by Cupid, but his death is definitely suspicious.

DEAN (on the phone) Yeah, well, I just went through the police blotter, and counting him, that's eight suicides since Wednesday and 19 ODs-- That's way out of the seasonal batting average.

SAM Yeah, if there's a pattern here, it ain't just love. It's a hell of a lot bigger than we thought. (Sam rubs his temple, like he has a headache)

DEAN Yeah, all right. I'll see you in 10.

SAM Yeah, okay.

(Sam hangs up the phone. He sees the same bald man in a black suit walking by across the street - the man is holding a briefcase. Again Sam hears the man's heartbeat. Sam follows him down an alley)

DEMON Ugh! Ugh!

SAM (pins the demon against the wall, and holds Ruby's knife to his throat) I know what you are, damn it. (Sam cuts the demon's cheek)

DEMON Aaah!

SAM I could smell you.

DEMON Winchester.

(they fight, Sam knicks the demon again in the arm)

DEMON Aah!

(The demon drops his briefcase and runs away. Sam breathes heavily and looks at the demon blood on the knife. He cleans off the blade quickly)

INT. HOTEL ROOM

DEAN What the hell does a demon got to do with this, anyway?

SAM Believe me, I got no idea.

DEAN You okay?

SAM Yeah, yeah. I'll be all right.

DEAN (looking at the briefcase) Let's crack her open. What's the worst that could happen, right?

(they open the briefcase anda bright light escapes)

SAM Whoa!

DEAN What the hell was that?

CASTIEL It's a human soul. It's starting to make sense. (Castiel takes a bite out of his burger)

SAM Now, what about that makes sense?

DEAN And when did you start eating?

CASTIEL Exactly. My hunger-- it's a clue, actually.

SAM For what?

DEAN For what?

CASTIEL This town is not suffering from some love-gone-wrong effect. It's suffering from hunger. Starvation, to be exact--Specifically...famine.

SAM Famine?As- as in the horseman?

DEAN Great. Th- th-that's freaking great.

SAM I thought famine meant starvation, like as in, you know, food.

CASTIEL Yes. Absolutely. But not just food. I mean, everyone seems to be starving for something--Sex, attention, drugs, love...

DEAN Well, that explains the puppy-lovers that Cupid shot up.

CASTIEL Right. The cherub made them crave love, and then Famine came, and made them rabid for it.

DEAN Okay, but what about you? I mean, since when do angels secretly hunger for White Castle?

CASTIEL It's my vessel-- Jimmy. His, uh, appetite for red meat has been touched by Famine's effect.

DEAN So, Famine just rolls into town and everybody goes crazy?

CASTIEL "And then will come Famine riding on a black steed. He will ride into the land of plenty... "

(we see Famine exit a large black SUV- he is guarded by a group of demons)

CASTIEL "... and great will be the Horseman's hunger, for he is hunger. "

(Famine and his demons enter a Biggerson's restaurant)

CASTIEL "His hunger will seep out and poison the air. "

(the restaurant patrons and staff are taken over by their hungers stuffing themselves with food drink, pills - one waitress takes all the money from the register, another couple starts kissing passionately)

FAMINE Hungry.

INT. HOTEL ROOM

CASTIEL Famin is hungry. He must devour the souls of his victims.

DEAN So, that's what was in the briefcase--The twinkie dude's soul?

CASTIEL Lucifer has sent his demons to care for Famine, to feed him, make certain he'll be ready.

SAM Ready for what?

CASTIEL To March across the land.

INT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT

(the demon Sam attacked enters)

FAMINE Hungry.

DEMON Sam Winchester--the vessel--He's here.

FAMINE Where?

DEMON At the hospital. We fought, but he got away. I...I got this off him. (holds up Sam's motel room key)

FAMINE Good. Yes. After lunch. Now, where is it?

DEMON Sorry?

FAMINE The one who loves cream cakes so much. Where is his soul?

DEMON I am sorry. No. The--Winchester took the case from me. Uh, he had the knife. I - I lost it.

FAMINE (yelling) But I'm hungry!

DEMON I'll get another. I-I won't be 10 minutes. (goes to leave)

FAMINE Hungry! Now! (Famine raises his hand, draws the demon's soul out and devours it) Oh, delicious!

ACT III
INT. HOTEL ROOM

(Sam stands by the sink and wipes his face with a cold washcloth)

DEAN Famine?

CASTIEL (through a mouthful of cheeseburger) Yes.

SAM So, what, this whole town is just gonna eat, drink, and screw itself to death?

CASTIEL We should stop it.

DEAN Yeah, that's a great idea. How?

CASTIEL How did you stop the last horseman you met?

DEAN War got his mojo from this ring. And after we cut it off, he just tucked tail and ran. And everybody that was affected, it was like they woke up out of a dream. You think Famine's got a class ring, too?

CASTIEL I know he does.

DEAN Well, okay. L- let's track him down and get to chopping.

CASTIEL Yeah. (eyes his empty fast food bad sadly)

(Sam is still cooling off his face and neck by the sink , he breathes heavily trying to calm down)

DEAN What are you, the Hamburglar?

CASTIEL I've developed a taste for ground beef.

DEAN Well, have you even tried to stop it?

CASTIEL I'm an angel. I can stop anytime I want.

DEAN Whatever. Sam, let's roll.

SAM Dean...I, um...I can't. I can't go.

DEAN What do you mean?

SAM I think it got to me, Dean. I think I'm hungry for it...

DEAN Hungry for what?

SAM You know.

DEAN Demon blood?

(Sam hangs his head)

DEAN You got to be kidding me. (to Castiel) You got to get him out of here. You got to beam him to, like, Montana. Anywhere but here.

CASTIEL It won't work. He's already infected. The hunger is just gonna travel with him.

DEAN Well, then, what do we do?

SAM You go cut that bastard's finger off.

DEAN You heard him.

SAM But, Dean...before you go, you better...you better lock me down - but good.

(Dean cuffs Sam to the bathroom sink pipe)

DEAN All right, well, just hang in there. We'll be back as soon as we can.

SAM Be careful. And... hurry.

(Castiel and Dean exit the bathroom, and Castiel blocks the bathroom door with a dresser)

INT. ST. JAMES MEDICAL CENTER

DEAN Hey, Marty. Is Dr. Corman around?

MARTY You haven't heard?

DEAN Heard what?

MARTY Guy's been dry for the last 20 years, but this morning, he left work, went home, and drank himself to death.

CASTIEL It's Famine.

MARTY Pardon?

DEAN Would you give us a minute, please?

MARTY Sure.

DEAN Thanks. Crap! I really kind of liked this guy.

CASTIEL They haven't harvested his soul yet.

DEAN Well, if we want to play "follow the soul" to get to Famine, our best shot starts with the doc, here.

INT. IMPALA

(Castiel appears with another hamburger)

DEAN Are you serious?

CASTIEL These make me...very happy.

DEAN How many is that?

CASTIEL I lost count. It's in the low hundreds. What I don't understand is...where is your hunger, Dean?

DEAN Huh?

CASTIEL Well, slowly but surely, everyone in this town is falling prey to Famine, but so far, you seem unaffected.

DEAN Hey, when I want to drink, I drink. When I want sex, I go get it. Same goes for a sandwich or a fight.

CASTIEL So...you're saying you're just well-adjusted?

DEAN God, no. I'm just well-fed.

CASTIEL Look there.

(Another man in a black suit comes out of the hospital, carrying a briefcase. He drives off. DEAN and CASTIEL follow him in the Impala.)

INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM

SAM (struggles against the cuffs) Ugh! (Sam hears the dresser being moved, unblocking the bathroom door) Guys? Guys, what happened? I don't think it worked. I think I'm still-- (the bathroom door opens, and two demons enter)...still hungry.

FEMALE DEMON Look at this. Someone trussed you up for us. Boss says we can't kill you...but I bet we can break off a few pieces.

(the male demon leans down and breaks Sam's cuffs. Sam knocks him violently back and he crashes into the shower wall)

MALE DEMON Ugh!

(Sam tackles the female demon and brings her crashing down onto the glass table in the main room. He grabs a shard of glass and stabs her in the throat with it. Sam latches onto the female demon's neck and starts drinking her blood)

FEMALE DEMON Ugh! (to male demon)Get him off! Get him off!

(the male demon tries to pull Sam off of the female demon, but can't budge him. We hear Sam's shirt tear. The male demon grabs a piece of wood and attempts to hit Sam with it, but Sam turns to face him, raises his hand and telekinetically flings the male demon against the wall)

SAM Wait your turn.

INT. IMPALA

DEAN Demons. You want to go over the plan again? Hey, happy meal. The plan?

CASTIEL I take the knife, I go in, I cut off the ring hand of Famine, and I meet you back here in the parking lot.

DEAN Well, that sounds foolproof. (Castiel disappears) This is taking too long. (Dean gets out of the car)

INT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT

DEAN Cas! Cas.

(Castiel is kneeling on the floor, stuffing his mouth with raw ground meat. Two demons attack Dean, and bring him to Famine )

ACT IV
INT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT

FAMINE The other Mr. Winchester.

DEAN (gesturing at Castiel) What did you do to him?

FAMINE You sicced your dog on me. I just threw him a steak.

DEAN So this is your big trick? Huh? Making people cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

FAMINE Doesn't take much--hardly a push. Oh, America--all-you-can-eat, all the time. Consume, consume. A swarm of locusts in stretch pants. And yet, you're all still starving because hunger doesn't just come from the body, it also comes from the soul.

DEAN It's funny, it doesn't seem to be coming from mine.

FAMINE Yes. I noticed that. Have you wondered why that is? How you could even walk in my presence?

DEAN Well, I like to think it's because of my strength of character.

FAMINE I disagree. (Famine moves closer to Dean and touches him) Yes. I see. That's one deep, dark nothing you got there, Dean. Can't fill it, can you? Not with food or drink. Not even with sex.

DEAN Oh, you're so full of crap.

FAMINE Oh, you can smirk and joke and lie to your brother, lie to yourself, but not to me! I can see inside you, Dean. I can see how broken you are, how defeated. You can't win, and you know it. But you just keep fighting. Just... keep going through the motions. You're not hungry, Dean, because inside, you're already...dead.

SAM Let him go.

(Famine turns to face Sam. Sam's face is stained with blood)

FAMINE Sam...

DEAN Sammy, no!

(two of the five demons guarding Famine move to attack Sam)

FAMINE Stop! No one lays a finger on this sweet little boy. Sam, I see you got the snack I sent you.

SAM You sent?

FAMINE Don't worry. You're not like everyone else. You'll never die from drinking too much. You're the exception that proves the rule. Just the way...Satan wanted you to be. So... (Famine lifts his hands and gestures at the demons guarding him)...cut their throats. Have at them!

DEAN Sammy, no!

FAMINE Please, be my guest.

(Sam lifts his hand, closes his eyes, and pulls all five demons from their hosts at once. Dean watches in shock. The demon smoke pools on the floor.)

SAM (lowers his hand) No.

FAMINE Well...Fine. If you don't want them...then I'll have them.

(Famine devours all five of the demon souls. Sam steps forward and extends his hand toward Famine.)

FAMINE I'm a Horseman, Sam. Your power doesn't work on me.

SAM You're right. But it will work on them. (Sam uses his power to rip out all the souls Famine consumed)

FAMINE Aahh!

(Sam's nose bleeds with the effort, but the demon souls explode out of Famine and Famine slumps, his eyes empty. Dean looks at Sam, as does Castiel )

FINAL ACT
INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - BASEMENT

(Castiel and Dean stand outside the panic room door. In the panic room - Sam screams)

SAM Let me out of here, please! Help!

CASTIEL That's not him in there. Not really.

DEAN I know.

CASTIEL Dean, Sam just has to get it out of his system. Then he'll be--

DEAN Listen, I just, uh...I just need to get some air.

EXT. BOBBY'S SCRAPYARD

DEAN Please...I can't...I need some help. Please?
