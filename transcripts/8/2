EXT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO – DAY


Chicago, Illinois


INT. BANK – DAY


A WOMAN bank employee is leading a man towards the safety deposit vaults.


WOMAN
So sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Vili. It's just...it's been so long since you checked in with us. We had to dig through our archives.


MR VILI
Don't worry about me, dear. I've got plenty of time.


WOMAN
Which box is it again?


MR VILI
One.


WOMAN
I'm... sorry. Did you say one, as in box number one?


MR VILI
If memory serves.


The WOMAN unlocks a safety deposit box and carries it to a table.


WOMAN
During our last renovation, we had to replace the safe boxes, and we put yours inside a new one.


MR VILI
Ah...


MR VILI lifts his box out of the one the WOMAN opened. He unlocks it and smiles. The WOMAN gasps. MR VILI lifts a bone, which shines with light for a moment, out of the box.


WOMAN
I'm...sorry, sir, but... is that a bone?


MR VILI
Not just any bone, my dear. An extremely valuable one.


WOMAN
Well, I'm happy we were able to keep it safe for you all these years.


MR VILI
Hmm.


WOMAN
Is there anything else I can help you with today?


MR VILI
Why, yes, now that I think about it. I'd like to make a withdrawal.


The WOMAN screams. Blood splatters the wall lined with safety deposit boxes.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. RESTAURANT – DAY


DEAN is eating a hamburger at an outdoor table.


DEAN
[mouth full] Are you kidding me? You're kidding me.


KEVIN
What? Is it too much to ask if we can swing by and check on my mom?


DEAN
"Swing by?” It's a day's drive in the opposite direction. You know that, right?


KEVIN
Yes. I understand we're in a hurry.


DEAN
Okay, well, then, what's the problem?


KEVIN
Channing's broken neck is my problem! As in I'd rather not see my mom twisted into a corkscrew.


SAM
Kid's got a point, Dean.


DEAN
Stay out of this. [SAM smiles.] Kevin, your mom is fine.


A waitress brings more food.


KEVIN
How can you possibly know that?


DEAN
Because Crowley needs her to be, okay? In fact, he's probably got the place stacked with bodyguards right now, protecting her so that when you do show up, they'll pounce on you both.


KEVIN
Is that supposed to make me feel better?


DEAN
She's bait, man, plain and simple. And you want to swim right up and bite the hook? Look, we have got Crowley by the short and curlies, okay? All we need to do is find the tablet, whip up the spell, and – boom! – sunshine and sandy beaches.


KEVIN
Dean, my mom's all alone. She's surrounded by demons. Can you really not understand why I want to make sure she's okay?


DEAN looks at SAM, who shrugs.


DEAN
Son of a bitch. [He puts down his hamburger and throws his hands in the air.] Fine. Let's go.


EXT. ROAD – DAY


The IMPALA drives down a road.


EXT. TOWN STREET – DAY


Neighbor, Michigan


The IMPALA is parked across the street from a blue house. DEAN, SAM and KEVIN are all looking at the house, SAM through binoculars.


SAM
Tiger mom, 9 o'clock.


KEVIN grabs the binoculars from SAM.


KEVIN
Where?


SAM
Left window.


MRS TRAN can be seen at the window.


KEVIN
She seems okay. Sad... but okay.


DEAN
Check out the mailman.


KEVIN looks through the binoculars at a MAILMAN putting letters into the mailbox.


KEVIN
Yeah, that's Carl. So what?


DEAN
Yeah, well, Carl's filled your mom's mailbox three times since we've been sitting here.


KEVIN
He's a demon?


DEAN
And see the gardener? [A GARDENER is watering plants in front of the house.] Think that plant needs any more water? [Water is running onto a path and down stairs in front of the house.]


CUT TO:


The GARDENER is still watering plants with a hose. The water stops flowing and he walks around the side of the house to investigate. DEAN stabs him with Ruby’s demon-killing knife. The GARDENER screams and falls down dead.


CUT TO:


The MAILMAN is walking along the street in front of the house when he hears a noise from near the house. His eyes turn black as he goes to investigate. He walks through the unlatched gate to the back yard and finds DEAN standing there. DEAN waves as SAM steps out from behind the gate and stabs the MAILMAN with the knife. The MAILMAN drops to the ground dead.


INT. TRAN RESIDENCE – DAY


MRS TRAN and a WOMAN are sitting at a table playing cards.


WOMAN
He'll be back. You just have to believe.


MRS TRAN
Thanks, Eunis. And I do believe. I just... wish I could do more.


EUNIS
Linda, you're doing all you should by staying here. He needs to know he has a home to come back to.


There is a knock at the door. MRS TRAN opens it to find KEVIN standing there.


KEVIN
Hi, Mom.


MRS TRAN
Oh! Kev– Kevin!


DEAN and SAM step forward from either side of KEVIN and throw liquid on MRS TRAN.


MRS TRAN
Ah! Oh! What...


DEAN
She's clean.


KEVIN hugs MRS TRAN, who cries with happiness in his arms.


SAM
You smell that?


SAM and DEAN walk into the house. As SAM enters the kitchen, black smoke pours from EUNIS’s mouth.


SAM
Et secta diabolica, omnis congregatio, omnis legio, omnis incursion... [The black smoke flows back into EUNIS.] ...infernalis adversarii, omnis spiritus exorcizamus!


KEVIN puts his arms around MRS TRAN as she watches in horror. DEAN stabs EUNIS with the knife.


MRS TRAN
Aah!


EUNIS screams as her body flashes with light, then falls to the ground dead.


MRS TRAN
Eunis!


DEAN
That's not Eunis.


CUT TO:


MRS TRAN is sitting on a sofa. KEVIN sits down next to her.


SAM
Mrs. Tran, your friend was possessed by a demon.


KEVIN
Have you ever seen "The Exorcist"?


MRS TRAN
Is that what you've been doing all year – watching television? Did you really have to kill her?


DEAN
The demon would have warned Crowley where Kevin was if we didn't.


MRS TRAN
And Crowley is the one who kidnapped you?


KEVIN
Yeah. He needs me to translate his stupid tablet so he can take over the universe or something.


DEAN
Which is why we need to get it so that we can slam the gates of Hell forever with Crowley inside.


SAM
So that things like that don't ever happen again.


MRS TRAN
Prophet of the Lord, huh? It does have a nice ring to it. I'll get packed. [She gets up.]


DEAN
We're gonna need a safe house since Crowley's been to the cabin, so –


MRS TRAN
Safe house? I thought we were going to get the tablet.


DEAN
Uh, we are. You're taking a trip to a demon-free zone.


MRS TRAN
And risk letting Kevin fall into the hands of this Crowley again? I don't think so.


SAM
Ms. Tran, all due respect, Dean's right. Crowley – he's not just a killer. He trades in torment. And if he can find a way to separate your soul from you, he'll take that soul to Hell and – and roast it till there's nothing left but black smoke. Look, it's best if you let us handle this.


MRS TRAN
I understand. But it's not my soul I'm worried about. It's my son's. [She stands with her arms folded.]


DEAN
Kevin, you want to back us up here? Came all the way down here to pull her out of the fire, and now she wants to jump right back in.


KEVIN
Like I can tell her what to do?


DEAN and MRS TRAN look at each other. He finally chuckles and shrugs.


DEAN
All right. Coming with us has conditions – uh, hex bags to stay off the bad guys' radar and, uh, you're gonna have to get inked up.


KEVIN
Do what, now?


SAM
Yeah, uh... [He pulls his shirt open to reveal his tattoo.] You, too, shortstop. Keeps the demons out.


MRS TRAN
Fine.


DEAN
Really?


MRS TRAN
What, like it's my first tattoo?


MRS TRAN walks out of the room. KEVIN stares after her. DEAN smiles, somewhat admiringly.


[The Reverend Horton Heat's "The Devil's Chasing Me" plays.]


INT. TATTOO PARLOR – DAY


KEVIN whimpers as the tattoo artist works on his arm. Next to him, MRS TRAN sits impassively as another tattoo artist works on her arm. She reaches out her hand for KEVIN to hold. They both hold hex bags in their other hands.


♪ Black clouds in the east ♪

♪ The devil's chasing me ♪


DEAN and SAM stand at the front of the tattoo parlor watching.


DEAN
You smell it, Sammy?


SAM
Burning flesh?


DEAN
Revenge. So close. Hey, how'd you do that reverse-exorcism thing?


SAM
Just said the verse backwards.


♪ The devil's chasing me ♪


KEVIN squeals in pain as the tattooing continues.


EXT. BUS STATION – DAY


Laramie, Wyoming


INT. BUS STATION – DAY


SAM and DEAN walk separately through the bus station. KEVIN and MRS TRAN sit on a bench waiting for them.


SAM
So, place is clean, far as I can tell.


KEVIN hands a key to DEAN.


DEAN
All right. Positive thoughts.


DEAN opens a locker. He and SAM look inside it and DEAN takes out a bag.


DEAN
You hid the Word of God in a diaper bag?


KEVIN
No.


DEAN looks through the bag, which seems to be empty. SAM smirks.


DEAN
Shut up.


DEAN tosses the bag back into the locker and slams the door.


ACT TWO
INT. BUS STATION – DAY


KEVIN and MRS TRAN are sitting on a bench. SAM and DEAN, now wearing suits, are standing with a GUARD in front of the lockers.


GUARD
Been nothing but trouble with these lockers. Got broke into damn near every day for a while. Could never figure out who it was till yesterday.


SAM
Oh, so you know who did it?


GUARD
Sure. Was Clem Smedley, a guy who worked the desk before me.


DEAN
Please tell me he's down at County right now.


GUARD
Yep, waiting for arraignment.


SAM
Thanks.


INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY


CLEM SMEDLEY and SAM are sitting at the table. DEAN slowly paces near the table.


CLEM SMEDLEY
Should have known they'd plant a LoJack in one of them bags. Sharp guy, that Jerry. He'll be a fine replacement for me.


SAM
Right. Well, in one of those lockers, there was a tablet. Do you know where it is?


CLEM SMEDLEY
Can I even acknowledge that without my lawyer here?


SAM
Uh, look, I'm sure we can work out a little, uh, something-something with the locals if you just cooperate.


CLEM SMEDLEY
What kind of [voice fading out as the camera focuses on DEAN’s face and the scene blurs] something-something?


FLASHBACK


EXT. PURGATORY


DEAN turns a slow circle with his axe weapon in his hand. BENNY is standing in front of a humanoid MONSTER that is sprawled with its back to a tree.


BENNY
I don't think he knows, man.


INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY


The camera stays on a close-up of DEAN’s face.


SAM (V-O)
Leniency?


FLASHBACK


EXT. PURGATORY


DEAN leans over and puts a hand on the MONSTER’s shoulder.


DEAN
Oh, he knows. Where's the angel?


We see a close-up of the MONSTER’s face, then DEAN’s.


INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY


The close-up of DEAN’s face in PURGATORY segues to a close-up of DEAN’s face in the present.


CLEM SMEDLEY
So, here's what I'm thinking – full immunity from all charges… [DEAN removes his tie] …both past, present, and future.


DEAN walks behind CLEM SMEDLEY and puts his tie around his neck. He pulls CLEM SMEDLEY to his feet, pushes him against a wall and holds a knife to his throat.


SAM
Hey! [He raps his hand on the table.] Dean. Come on.


DEAN
You…


FLASHBACK


EXT. PURGATORY


The scene of DEAN menacing CLEM SMEDLEY segues into a scene of DEAN menacing the MONSTER, which is chained to the tree.


DEAN
…feel that?


MONSTER
There's a stream.


DEAN
Go on.


MONSTER
It runs through a clearing not far from here. I'll show you.


DEAN holds the tip of his knife against the MONSTER’s throat under its chin.


DEAN
How about you just tell me?


SAM (V-O)
Hey.


INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY


DEAN still holds his knife to CLEM SMEDLEY’s throat.


SAM
Dean!


CLEM SMEDLEY
Pawn shop, First and Main.


FLASHBACK


EXT. PURGATORY


DEAN
Go on.


MONSTER
Three days' journey. Follow the stream. There's a clearing. You'll find your angel there.


DEAN looks behind him at BENNY, who raises an eyebrow.


DEAN
You know what, Mutt? I believe you.


DEAN pushes his knife into the MONSTER’s skull from under its chin. We can see the knife blade in its open mouth. The MONSTER chokes and gurgles. DEAN pulls out his knife and the MONSTER’s head falls forward.


INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY


SAM
Dean?


DEAN removes the tie from CLEM SMEDLEY’s neck.


FLASHBACK


EXT. PURGATORY


DEAN walks away from the MONSTER and past BENNY, who follows him.


INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY


SAM
Come on.


SAM and DEAN leave the interview room.


EXT. STREET – DAY


A red Ferrari is parked on the side of the street. The IMPALA pulls up and DEAN, SAM, KEVIN and MRS TRAN get out.


KEVIN
[looking at the Ferrari] Whoa.


MRS TRAN
Hey.


INT. PAWN SHOP – DAY


SAM
Hello, sir. Agents Neil and Sixx, FBI. [He holds up a badge.] Uh, we're looking for a tablet.


DEAN
About, uh, yea big, got some hieroglyphic crap on it.


SAM
Sold to you by a thief named Clem. Ring a bell?


CLERK
Nope.


DEAN looks at the CLERK’s name tag.


DEAN
Hey, Lyle, I've had a really, really bad day today, so I'm not in the mood to dillydally. If you want to do this the rough way, I am happy to oblige.


LYLE
Sure. We can do it that way, if you want to get famous. [He gestures to security cameras and we see the scene in black and white.]


MRS TRAN
That your car outside?


LYLE
What's it to you, mail-order?


DEAN
Hey! [He slams his hand on the counter.] Pal!


MRS TRAN
I got it. I notice you're driving with expired tags, maybe because you just acquired it in a trade, and I'm guessing that means you haven't registered it yet, which means you haven't paid the tax. Is that correct?


LYLE
None of your business.


MRS TRAN
Kevin, average blue book on a 2010 Ferrari F430 Spider?


KEVIN
$217,000.


MRS TRAN
And the 5% Wyoming tax?


SAM
$10,850.


MRS TRAN
$10,000. Something tells me you're the type who might balk at a tax bill that big.


LYLE
W-what is this, an FBI audit?


MRS TRAN
No. But my brother, who happens to work for the Wyoming tax assessor's office could arrange that if he thought something untoward was happening here. So what's it going to be – the tablet or that piece of Eurotrash crap you call a car?


EXT. PAWN SHOP – DAY


The IMPALA drives away.


EXT. MOTEL – DAY


SAM knocks on the door of Room 126.


SAM
Sure this is the right place?


DEAN
It's what the pawn slip says.


A MAN calls out and SAM, DEAN, KEVIN and MRS TRAN all turn.


MAN
Kevin?


The MAN is dapperly dressed and is holding a cane.


DEAN
Who wants to know?


MAN
Oh, relax, Dean. I'm not going to steal your Prophet. [to MRS TRAN] Ah. And you must be Kevin's mother. Um... Beau. And it is my absolute pleasure. [He kisses MRS TRAN’s hand and she smiles.] And, um, Kevin. Imagine my luck. Here I was, working so hard looking for you that I never stopped to think you might be looking for me. I have something for you.


MAN
What is it?


BEAU
[holding up an envelope with Kevin’s name on it] An invitation, dear man, to a very exclusive auction.


DEAN
Let me guess – where you'll be selling the tablet?


BEAU
Well, when we acquire an item as hot as the Word of God, it's smart to unload it as fast as possible. And we are in such desperate need of a headliner for tonight's gala.


DEAN
Well, I hope you have three extra tickets to your little eBay party, 'cause the Prophet's with us.


BEAU
Oh, if you're worried about the safety of the Prophet, rest assured that we have a strict "no casting, no cursing, no supernaturally flicking the two of you against the wall just for the fun of it" policy.


SAM
Is that right? How'd you manage that?


BEAU
Well, I am the right hand of a God, after all – Plutus, specifically.


DEAN
Is that even a planet anymore?


BEAU
It's the God of greed. And my liege has warded these premises against Hell, Heaven, and beyond – quite necessary with some of the players we see. And incidentally, quite possibly the safest place your precious Prophet could be. Mmm. Well, since time is of the essence, perhaps I'll just go ahead and add a plus-three to the Prophet's invitation. Copacetic?


BEAU tosses the envelope into the air and disappears.


DEAN
Well, thank you, Mr. Peanut! All right. What do we have to bid? [SAM scoffs.] What? We can't just show up there empty-handed.


SAM
Dean, all we have to our names is a few hacked gold cards.


DEAN
All right. Well, then, we're gonna have to get creative.


SAM
Huh. [He looks at the IMPALA.] Well...


DEAN
No. Mnh-mnh. Say it and I will kill you, your children, and your grandchildren.


SAM
Okay, okay. Uh... Wait a second. They – these auctions – they display the items to the bidders beforehand, right?


DEAN
Yeah, so?


SAM
So all we got to do is get Kevin close enough to memorize the spell.


DEAN
What do you think, brainiac? Think you can swing it?


MRS TRAN
Of course he can swing it... if the bumper stickers on my Previa mean anything.


DEAN
[to the IMPALA] They didn't mean it, baby.


INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT


A man opens the door to admit KEVIN, SAM, MRS TRAN and DEAN. They each walk through a metal detector, which sounds an alarm for DEAN.


BEAU
Now, now, Dean. The system only works when everyone participates.


CUT TO:


DEAN puts his gun into a box holding other weapons. He holds up Ruby’s demon-killing knife.


DEAN
I'll be back for this. [He puts the knife in the box.]


CUT TO:


Auction attendees look at items on display in glass cases. The items include a sword, a manuscript and a large hammer.


DEAN
How the hell are we supposed to know who's who?


SAM
It's pretty simple, Dean. They're all monsters.


DEAN
Hey, hey.


DEAN and the others walk over to a display case containing the Word of God. A piece of metal has been affixed in front of the tablet so it cannot be read.


DEAN
Great.


KEVIN
I guess we're not as original as we thought.


SAM
It's okay. It's okay. We just got to come up with a plan "B."


CROWLEY
And what, pray tell, could possibly have been plan "A"? Bring the Prophet to the most dangerous place on Earth, memorize the tablet, and then vamoose? Hello, boys.


ACT THREE
INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN
Crowley.


CROWLEY
Kevin. What a pleasure to see you. Sorry about your little playdate. Her name? Ah. Well, if you're gonna make an omelet, sometimes you have to break some spines. And who is this lovely young thing? Must be your sister.


MRS TRAN slaps CROWLEY hard across the face.


CROWLEY
Ah!


MRS TRAN
Stay away from my son.


CROWLEY
Charming. Defiling her corpse has just made number one on my to-do list. [DEAN steps forward and SAM moves to stop him.] Unh, unh, unh, unh. Don't mind a little love tap, but anything more, and our mookie pals here may just throw you out, and that would be a shame.


SAM
He's right, Dean. It's not worth it.


CROWLEY
Listen to Moose, Squirrel.


A BALD MAN enters the room.


CROWLEY
Ah. Here comes our host.


MAN’S VOICE
Honored guests, please take your seats.


DEAN
That's Plutus? What is he, God of the candy aisle?


BEAU
Gentlemen, the auction is starting.


CROWLEY
Good luck with the bidding.


SAM
[to MRS TRAN, as they walk towards their seats] Nice right hook.


A YOUNG MAN in a fast-food employee’s uniform walks up to DEAN.


YOUNG MAN
Dean Winchester?


DEAN
Do I know you?


YOUNG MAN
Uh, no, but, uh, I knew Castiel.


DEAN
You're an angel?


YOUNG MAN
This – this was the nearest vessel on short notice. We don't usually come to things like this, but, uh...


DEAN
You're chasing the magic rock?


YOUNG MAN
We protect the word of God.


DEAN
Well, awesome job so far, uh... [He reads the YOUNG MAN’s name tag.] Alfie.


YOUNG MAN
Actually, my name is Samandiriel.


DEAN
Let's just stick with Alfie.


SAMANDIRIEL
I wanted to ask you about Castiel. What happened to him?


DEAN
Well, me and Cas – we, uh – we iced Dick Roman and got a one-way rocket ride to Purgatory for our trouble.


SAMANDIRIEL
But you escaped. Did – did Castiel? [DEAN doesn’t respond.] You know, there are some in Heaven who still believe, despite his mistakes, that Castiel's heart was always in the right place.


DEAN
Are you one of them?


SAMANDIRIEL
I think too much heart was always Castiel's problem.


SAMANDIRIEL walks away.


FLASHBACK


EXT. PURGATORY


CASTIEL is washing his hands and face at a stream. DEAN and BENNY approach.


DEAN
Cas!


CASTIEL
Dean. [He stands up as DEAN and BENNY walk closer.]


DEAN
Cas.


DEAN laughs and hugs CASTIEL.


DEAN
Damn, it's good to see you. Nice peach fuzz.


CASTIEL
Thank you.


DEAN
You should meet somebody. This is Benny. Benny, this is Cas.


BENNY
Hola.


CASTIEL
How did you find me?


DEAN
The bloody way. You feeling okay?


CASTIEL
You mean am I still... [He points to his head and makes circles with his finger.]


DEAN
Yeah, if you want to be on the nose about it, sure.


CASTIEL
No. I'm perfectly sane. But, then, 94% of psychotics think they're perfectly sane, so I guess we'd have to ask ourselves, "what is sane?"


DEAN
That's a good question.


BENNY
Why'd you bail on Dean?


DEAN
Dude –


BENNY
The way I hear it, you two hit monster land, and hot wings here took off. I figure he owes you some backstory.


DEAN
Look, we were surrounded, okay? Some freak jumped Cas. Obviously, he kicked its ass, right?


CASTIEL
No.


DEAN
What?


CASTIEL
I ran away.


DEAN
You ran away?


CASTIEL
I had to.


DEAN
That's your excuse for leaving me with those gorilla-wolves?


CASTIEL
Dean –


DEAN
You bailed out and, what, went camping? I prayed to you, Cas, every night.


CASTIEL
I know.


DEAN
You know and you didn't... What the hell's wrong with you?


CASTIEL
I am an angel in a land of abominations. There have been things hunting me from the moment we arrived.


DEAN
Join the club!


CASTIEL
These are not just monsters, Dean. They're Leviathan. I have a price on my head, and I've been trying to stay one step ahead of them, to – to keep them away from you. That's why I ran. Just leave me, please.


BENNY
Sounds like a plan. Let's roll.


DEAN
Hold on, hold on. Cas, we're getting out of here. We're going home.


CASTIEL
Dean, I can't.


DEAN
You can. Benny, tell him.


BENNY
Purgatory has an escape hatch, but I got no idea if it's angel-friendly.


DEAN
We'll figure it out. Cas, buddy, I need you.


CASTIEL
Dean...


DEAN
And if Leviathan want to take a shot at us, let ‘em. We ganked those bitches once before. We can do it again.


CASTIEL
It's too dangerous.


DEAN
Let me bottom-line it for you. I'm not leaving here without you. Understand?


CASTIEL
I understand.


INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT


We see a close-up of DEAN’s face as the flashback ends. Someone raps a gavel to begin the auction.


BEAU
Ladies, gentlemen, and...other, welcome to this once-in-a-lifetime event.


DEAN takes a seat next to SAM.


CROWLEY
Samandiriel. Slumming it, are we?


BEAU
The first name in magical and alchemical esoterica. [SAM, DEAN, MRS TRAN and KEVIN take out their wallets. The others pass their cash to DEAN.] Our prices may be high, but our quality is unmatched, and we stand by our products.


CROWLEY
Don't know why you're so keen on that hunk of dirt. So it tells you how to blast back a few demons? I'll just make more. Can't get rid of all of my black-eyed boys, Samantha.


SAM
Yeah, we'll see.


BEAU
And across the plane...


SAM
All right. So, how much we got for plan "B"?


DEAN
Uh, well, we got our hacked credit cards, $2,000, and a, uh, Costco membership.


BEAU
Our first item, the amulet of Hesperus. Let's start the bidding with, um, three tons of dwarven gold? [DEAN raises his eyebrows and looks at SAM.] Ah. This lady. I have three. Do I have, uh, four? Ah. Four, gentlemen here. Four. Going for five. Five? [CROWLEY smiles.] Five to this lady. Do we have an advance on five tons?


SAM
Plan "C"?


DEAN
Big time.


BEAU
Any other bids? Any other bids?


DEAN
I'm gonna use the restroom.


BEAU
Sold.


DEAN follows an AUCTION STAFF MEMBER who wheels away a trolley containing auction items. The AUCTION STAFF MEMBER unlocks a room with a metal door and pushes the trolley inside, then locks the room again and walks back towards the auction. DEAN bumps into him.


DEAN
Oh, sorry.


DEAN waits until the AUCTION STAFF MEMBER has gone, then looks at a key which he apparently took from him. He uses the key to unlock the metal door. Two men are inside.


DEAN
This isn't the men's room.


We see a close-up of the Word of God on a table in the room.


DEAN
Okay.


DEAN closes the door and heads back towards the auction.


BEAU
Our next item up for bid, the hammer of Thor, Mjoelnir.


MR VILI
A finger bone from the frost giant Ymir.


BEAU looks at PLUTUS, who shakes his head.


MR VILI
Uh... the bone and, uh… [He holds up a bloodstained brown paper bag.] …5/8 of a virgin.


SAM recoils slightly. DEAN walks back into the room. PLUTUS nods.


BEAU
Ah. Sold.


DEAN hits SAM on the arm to get him to move one seat over and sits down next to him.


DEAN
Plan "C" tanked.


CROWLEY
Maybe you should try plan "D" for dumbass.


BEAU
Our next lot, the Word of God… [He holds up the tablet.] …capital "G" – very old, very rare.


CROWLEY
[standing] Three billion dollars.


DEAN and SAM
[simultaneously] Whoa.


SAMANDIRIEL
[standing] The "Mona Lisa."


CROWLEY
The real "Mona Lisa," where she's topless.


SAMANDIRIEL
Vatican City.


CROWLEY
Alaska.


BEAU
Palin and a bridge to nowhere? No, thanks.


CROWLEY
All right. The moon.


You're bidding the moon?


CROWLEY
Yeah. Claimed it for Hell. Think a man named Buzz gets to go into space without making a deal?


BEAU
Ah. I'm sorry, gentlemen. It seems that our reserve price has not been met. So in order to stimulate the bidding, we're going to add an item to this lot… [He points] …Kevin Tran, Prophet of the Lord.


MRS TRAN gasps. KEVIN disappears.


MRS TRAN
[standing] No!


KEVIN reappears, chained near PLUTUS. SAM and DEAN stand up, but an AUCTION EMPLOYEE behind them forces them back into their seats with a hand on their shoulders.


BEAU
Mr. Tran is the only person on Earth who can read this tablet, which makes them a perfect matching set.


CROWLEY
So out of your league.


BEAU
So, do I hear a bid of, um –


MRS TRAN
No, stop! I'll give you whatever you want. I have a 401(K), my house.


PLUTUS chuckles.


BEAU
Good effort, Ms. Tran, but I'm afraid this is a little out of your price range.


MRS TRAN
My soul.


KEVIN
Mom, don't!


MRS TRAN
I bid my soul!


DEAN
Are you sure? That's a big move.


PLUTUS
Interesting.


CROWLEY
If it's souls that you're after, I can give you a million souls.


DEAN
Hey, flyboy, are you gonna get in on this?


SAMANDIRIEL
We guard the souls in Heaven. We don't horse-trade them.


CROWLEY
So we have a deal.


PLUTUS
It's not about the quantity, chief. It's about the sacrifice. This little lady's soul is the most valuable thing she has. It's everything. Are you willing to offer everything, Mr. Crowley?


DEAN
Tick-tock.


CROWLEY
Fine. You win. I bid... my own soul!


PLUTUS
[laughs] Mr. Crowley, you don't have a soul. [to MRS TRAN] Congrats, sweetheart.


MRS TRAN
Thank you. Thank you.


CROWLEY leaves the room. KEVIN looks distressed and MRS TRAN afraid.


ACT FOUR
INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT


SAM and DEAN are sitting with MRS TRAN in the room where the auction was held.


MRS TRAN
Losing my soul – is it going to hurt?


DEAN
Probably.


MRS TRAN
Will I die?


SAM
No. You'll just wish you were dead.


MRS TRAN
[whispering] Okay.


BEAU enters the room.


BEAU
It's time.


DEAN and SAM stand up. MRS TRAN remains seated.


DEAN
You all right?


MRS TRAN
[on the verge of tears] Yeah. Can I – can I just have a minute?


DEAN and SAM walk a few steps away.


SAM
Dean, this sucks.


DEAN
Are you kidding me? We're about to close the gates of Hell forever. If you ask me, we got off cheap.


DEAN and SAM leave the room. MRS TRAN stands up. SAMANDIRIEL approaches her.


SAMANDIRIEL
Excuse me, miss. Hi. My name is Sam– Alfie. I'm an angel.


MRS TRAN
Who works at Wiener Hut?


SAMANDIRIEL
No. This is, uh – it doesn't matter. Uh, what you did in here was amazing, and I want you to know that my friends and I can protect your son. The Winchesters are exceptional men, but... they're just men. If Kevin comes with us –


MRS TRAN
Oh, no, no. The last time that angels tried to help my son, I watched them die, and Kevin went missing for a year. So, no offense, but… [She has tears in her eyes.] …I'm gonna take my chances with them.


SAMANDIRIEL nods.


CUT TO:


MR VILI picks up Thor’s hammer.


MR VILI
Mjoelnir, I've missed you.


He cradles the hammer to his chest and walks off. BEAU and MRS TRAN walk up to SAM and DEAN.


DEAN
Where's the kid?


PLUTUS snaps his fingers and KEVIN appears.


SAM
What are you gonna do with her soul?


PLUTUS
Whatever I want. I might sell it, or maybe I'll just tuck it away with my other precious objects, let them keep me warm at night. Mm. [He chuckles. MRS TRAN looks afraid, but lifts her chin and straightens her shoulders. PLUTUS holds out his hands.] Whenever you're ready, dear.


After a pause, MRS TRAN holds out a hand and steps forward.


DEAN
Wait!


DEAN grabs MRS TRAN’s outstretched arm and pushes up her sleeve. Her demon-proofing tattoo has been burned off.


MRS TRAN
[in CROWLEY’s voice] Hello, boys. [Her eyes turn red.]


SAM
Crowley.


MRS TRAN flings out her arms and sends SAM and DEAN flying.


PLUTUS
No. You can't. My warding spells.


MRS TRAN
Your girl Friday showed me a few loopholes.


PLUTUS looks at BEAU, who smiles and shrugs.


FLASHBACK to the earlier conversation between MRS TRAN and SAMANDIRIEL


BEAU is watching MRS TRAN and SAMANDIRIEL talk.


MRS TRAN
No offense, but I'm going to take my chances with them.


SAMANDIRIEL leaves. BEAU closes the door in MRS TRAN’s face.


BEAU
Now, that... was very, very stupid!


BEAU grabs MRS TRAN’s arms and forces her against the wall. She screams as he holds up a cigarette lighter to burn off her tattoo.


The flashback ends.


MRS TRAN
And all it cost me was an island in the South Pacific. I love a bargain.


BEAU stabs PLUTUS from behind. MRS TRAN pulls out the stake from PLUTUS’s chest and hurls it at a MAN who was guarding KEVIN.


MRS TRAN
Can't do all my tricks, but I can do enough.


KEVIN
Get out of her!


DEAN reaches into the box of confiscated weapons and takes out the demon-killing knife. MRS TRAN picks up the Word of God.


MRS TRAN
If I had a nickel for every time someone screamed that at me...


SAM tackles MRS TRAN to the ground, then gets up and stands next to DEAN in front of KEVIN. MRS TRAN also stands up.


DEAN
Getting in touch with your feminine side, huh, Crowley?


MRS TRAN
Something like that.


DEAN
Well, come and get him.


MRS TRAN looks behind SAM and DEAN at KEVIN.


MRS TRAN
One out of two ain't bad. [She runs from the room carrying the Word of God.]


DEAN
[to SAM] Watch the kid! [He runs after MRS TRAN.]


SAM
Kevin, don't! Let Dean take care of it.


BEAU points a gun at SAM’s back.


KEVIN
Sam, move!


KEVIN pushes SAM away. BEAU shoots, but misses as SAM ducks for cover.


CUT TO:


MRS TRAN runs through the warehouse with DEAN following.


CUT TO:


BEAU continues to shoot at SAM, who is behind an upturned table with MR VILI.


KEVIN heads for the exit.


BEAU
Don't! [KEVIN stops.] You know what's better than one private island? Two private islands.


SAM comes up behind BEAU and swings Thor’s hammer at the back of BEAU’s head. Lightening crackles as BEAU falls. KEVIN runs out of the room.


MR VILI
Okay. Give it back. Give it back.


SAM holds out Thor’s hammer to MR VILI, then stops.


SAM
Where'd you get the 5/8 of a virgin?


MR VILI smiles and shrugs.


MR VILI
Oh, no.


SAM swings the hammer at MR VILI. Lightening crackles. The hammer falls onto a pile of MR VILI’s clothes.


CUT TO:


MRS TRAN is running through the warehouse. DEAN catches her and pushes her against a wall. The Word of God goes flying along the ground. DEAN holds his knife to MRS TRAN’s throat. KEVIN runs up.


KEVIN
Mom!


MRS TRAN pushes DEAN away. Red smoke pours from her mouth.


CUT TO:


A door opens and CROWLEY steps out, brushing off his coat.


CROWLEY
Well, that was exciting. Good luck closing the gates to Hell... [He picks up the Word of God.] …without this.


KEVIN is crouching down by MRS TRAN, who is on the floor leaning against the wall.


CROWLEY
Surprising what mommy dearest has rattling around in her head. Want to know who your real father is? Scandalous.


DEAN
Crowley!


CROWLEY
I know we're not mates, Kevin, but one word of advice – run. Run far and run fast. 'Cause the Winchesters – well, they have a habit of using people up and watching them die bloody. Toodles.


CROWLEY waves and leaves the room.


ACT FIVE
INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN, SAM, KEVIN and MRS TRAN are in the room where the auction was held. MRS TRAN sits unmoving in a chair. KEVIN sits in front of her with a hand on her knee.


SAM
Has she said anything? [KEVIN shakes his head.]


DEAN
Listen, Kev, what your mom went through – it's hell. Trust me, I know. But she seems tough. She'll pull it together.


KEVIN
You tried to kill her.


DEAN
Kid, in this life –


KEVIN
Shut up! I don't want to hear any more of your crappy speeches. I just want to talk to my mom alone.


SAM
Sure. Five minutes.


KEVIN
Mom...


MRS TRAN’s face is blank.


CUT TO:


SAM and DEAN are waiting in the next room.


SAM
Dean, were you really going to, uh...


DEAN
What? Slit soccer mom's throat? Yeah, I was. I wish I had.


SAM
Dean –


DEAN
It was Crowley, Sam. No matter what meat suit he's in, I should have knifed him. I mean, yeah, it would have sucked, and I would have hated myself, but what's one more nightmare, right? [Pause] It seem a little quiet in there to you?


SAM opens the door to the room where the auction was held. KEVIN and MRS TRAN are gone.


SAM
Kevin? Kevin!


DEAN
You've got to be kidding me! [He sees a folded piece of paper on a chair.] Hey.


SAM
What? [DEAN unfolds the note.] What's it say?


DEAN
Uh, that they bolted, that we shouldn't come looking, and since we lost the tablet, Kevin figures we don't need him.


SAM
Yeah, but Crowley still does. What's that kid thinking?!


DEAN
He thinks people I don't need anymore – they end up dead.


SAM
Dean, that – that – that's not true. You know that.


FLASHBACK


EXT. PURGATORY


CASTIEL is hanging over the edge of a drop. A hand grips his arm, preventing him from falling.


CASTIEL
Dean! Dean!


The hand lets go and CASTIEL falls a short distance.


CASTIEL
Aah! Dean!
