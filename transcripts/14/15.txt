Jack: I'm good, Castiel.
Castiel: Jack, you say that, but ever since the Hunters and their funerals How's the snake? I don't think he's feeling well.
Jack: He won't eat.
Castiel: Well, perhaps he misses his previous owner. He's been through a lot of change in a short period of time. I guess that's something you have in common. Jack, you killed Michael.You consumed his grace.It was enough. You have your powers back?
Jack: I think so. I feel different now, not like before, if that makes any sense.

Dean: Why?
Castiel: You were right. Jack is struggling. And I've tried, but --
Dean: Why do you think he'll talk to me?
Castiel: Well, because he looks up to you. And his soul -- I mean, you've seen this before.
Dean: No, no. No. See, I was -- I was not great with Sam, you know, when he was, uh But Jack's soul isn't completely gone.At least I don't think so.

Griffin: Mm-hmm.
Sam: Agent Scholz. This is Agent Delp. We're, uh, FBI. We're here about the incident.

Sam: So that's a no-no on the hooch?
Castiel: Sam, I don't know what's happened. I don't know if this is a spell or a curse or -- or what's happened, but you will snap the hell out of it!
Sam: Sir, you watch your mouth. If we cannot remain civil, then you can skedaddle.
Castiel: Sam --
Sam: That's not my name! - Cindy, grab his hat! -
Castiel: I don't wear a hat!
Cindy: Honey, I don't think he wore a hat!
Sam: Fine! Sir, using language like, uh, "H-E-double hockey sticks" -- You should have your mouth washed out with soap.

Castiel: I'm gonna -- Double hockey sticks?
EXT. DONATELLO'S HOUSE.
Donatello: Dean! Jack! Great to see you!
Dean: Donny, good to see you up and around.

Dean: Wow.
Jack: Our field trip is to see Donatello?
Dean: Well, with this whole soul thing, it's, uh -- We're worried about you, okay? And when it comes to souls or not having them, Donny here's an expert.
Jack: He is?
Donatello: Please. Come on in.
Dean: Actually, you know what? I'm gonna -- I'm gonna let you guys talk. I'll, uh, keep an eye on the snake.
INT. DONATELLO'S HOUSE.
Jack: Okay.
Donatello: Come on, Jack. So, you took this snake in, and now it gets to go on road trips? Fun!
Jack: Can I ask you something?
Donatello: That's what you're here for, isn't it?
Jack: How did you lose your soul?
Donatello: God's sister ripped it right out of me That wasn't my best day. But oddly, it wasn't my worst day, either.
Jack: And when it was gone, how did you -- how'd you feel?
Donatello: Like the galaxy. You know, Jack, our galaxy's all bright and shiny and spinny, but in its center lies this very large black hole. It's the same with me.I'm all bright and shiny, obviously -- Not so much spinny.
Jack: But inside?
Donatello: Empty.
Jack: So you feel bad?
Donatello: I feel nothing. Losing your soul doesn't make you bad. It doesn't make you anything. It's, um an absence of of pity, of empathy of humanity. How do you feel, Jack?
Jack: I don't know. I know I don't feel nothing, but I don't feel the same, either. And maybe I just don't know what nothing feels like. Mostly, I just don't want Sam and Dean and Cass to worry.
Donatello: They're your family. Families worry.
Jack: But I just -- I need time and space to figure things out on my own, but everywhere I go, there's someone looking over my shoulder.
Donatello: Ah. When I need to, uh, "blend," I ask myself, "What would Mr. Rogers do?"
Jack: Who's Mr....
Donatello: Rogers? The best man I know. Sam and Dean are the best men I know.So, ergo, whenever you don't want them to worry, just think "WWWD" -- "What Would the Winchesters Do?"
Jack: I can do that.
EXT. DONATELLO'S HOUSE.
Dean: Well, there they are.
Jack: How's the snake?
Dean: He's good. Might be hungry.
Jack: Okay.
Dean: So, what's the verdict? Does he have a soul?
Donatello: I suppose the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a soul?
Dean: Donny.
Donatello: What? I'm sorry. Um, I'd keep an eye on him, but I think if he seems okay, he probably is.
Dean: So he's not like you?
Donatello: Oh, no. I'm a Prophet of the Lord, but he -- [ Sighs ] Jack's probably the most powerful being in the universe. I mean, really, who knows what's going on inside his head?
Dean: Thanks.
INT. HARRINGTON'S SODA SHOPPE
Castiel: I think we should talk.
Sunny: I, uh -- Okay.
Sunny: About what?
Castiel: About how you're a witch.
Sunny: A witch?
Castiel: About how you brainwashed my friend and about how you've done something to this entire town.
Sunny: I don't know what you're talking about.
Castiel: Oh, yes, you do. You wrote these. You wrote them to Conrad.And between various steamy, erotic musings, you begged him to leave. Why is that? Because you were afraid you'd hurt him?
Sunny: You don't know what you're talking about.
Castiel: Okay, then tell me. Tell me, or I'll rip it from your mind. [Castiel's eyes glow blue] Fine. Have it your way.
Sunny: No, no, please! It's not me! It's him! He's out of control!
Chip: Well, now That's not very nice.
Castiel: So you did this.
Chip: What, did you think it was the milkshakes?
Castiel: What are you?
Chip: Well, I like to think of myself as a kind of Good Samaritan. You know, I've always been lucky. I've always had an intuition about what people are gonna do or say. Made me the king of poker night. But then the mill shut down, and this town -- the town I love -- had started to die. Then my sweet wife, she passed away. And the world kept gettin' worse, and they called it "modernization," and no matter what I did, people would turn to drink or drugs, they'd move away. They just weren't happy. Things kept getting worse, and I started to hear noises -- voices. And I screamed at these voices! I said, "Just make things better!" And you know what happened next?
Castiel: No, but I have a feeling you're gonna tell me.
Chip: The very next day, I thought -- just thought -- "I wish there was more people in the soda shop." And I came in here that day, and it was packed. And that's when I figured it out. I can make people do whatever I want.
Castiel: So you're some kind of mind-control psychic?
Chip: I re-made this town. I gave everybody new names, new lives. I made everybody happy. Well, most everybody, and, uh, the ones who fought it, well --
Castiel: You'd murder them.
Chip: I was just protecting my home!
Castiel: And you -- you knew all about this.
Sunny: Well, she knew enough to play along, but, uh... my tricks never worked on Sunny. She's too much like me.
Sunny: I am nothing like you.
Chip: But you. Why can't I change you?
Castiel: Because I'm not human.
Chip: Well gentlemen? Sunny! - Sunny!
Sunny: Get away from me!
Castiel: I won't hurt you, Sam.
Sam: Golly, I told you my name is Justin!
Sunny: You killed Conrad!
Chip: No! You told him the truth, and that's why he ran, and that's why I did what I had to do. No, you killed that boy, Sunny, not me.
Sunny: I didn't.
Man: Aah!
Castiel: Fight this!
Sam: Why? I'm happy in Charming Acres. We're all happy.
Castiel: Sam, I know you want to be happy. And I know what it's like to lose your army. I know what it's like to fail as a leader, Sam. But you can't lose yourself. You have to keep fighting. You can't lose yourself, because if you do, you fail us. You fail all of those that we've lost. You fail Jack. Sam, you fail Dean.
Sunny: You're sick.
Chip: Well, but you stayed. You didn't even try and stop me.
Castiel: Sam.
Sam: Cas?
Sunny: I promised Mom that I wouldn't leave you, but you're a monster.
Chip: No. No. In this town, I'm God.
Sunny: No.
Sam: No. You're not. Believe me. We've met God.
Castiel: God has a beard.
Chip: Sorry, sport.
Sunny: Stop! I said stop!
Chip: You see? I told you! You're just like me!
Sunny: No. You hurt innocent people. You want to be happy? Then be happy!
Sam: W-What did you do?
Sunny: I -- I don't --
Castiel: She made him happy. Your father is trapped inside his own mind. He's in a world that -- it's a beautiful world. But it's a place where he can never hurt anyone again.
Sunny: Good.
INT. BUNKER.
Dean: Well, it seemed like the snake enjoyed the trip.
Jack: Hard to say. He's, uh, very guarded.
Dean: Yeah. Yeah. And what about you, huh? Good time?
Jack: It was illuminating.
Dean. Oh. [to Sam and Castiel] Hey! How was Arkansas?
Sam: Arkansas was, uh... It was weird.

Dean: His room. [to Sam, after Castiel leaves] Really happy, huh?
Sam: I mean, I guess I was happy, but... It wasn't real, you know? Just...
Dean: Well, not a lot of happy goin' on around here.
Sam: I hate this place right now. I hate it. Everywhere I look, I see them. I see Maggie.I guess that's why, uh -- why I was so desperate to get out of here, why I kept running us ragged. But I got to stop that. I-I can't keep running. I -- This is my home. This is our home. Dean, I think I just need some time.
Dean: Okay.
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM.
Jack: Cas says you miss your friend. You need help. Sam and Dean would help you, so -- so I'll help you. I'll help you see your friend again. In Heaven. (Jack turns the snake into ashes using his powers as Cas watches behind the door.)
