TEASER
(Bluesy rock music playing)

(Scene opens on the exterior of the 'Ale House'. A young woman walks out of the bar and onto the sidewalk, texting as she walks.)

(Cellphone beeps, touchscreen clicking)

WOMAN

"Are you calling me a liar? Seriously?"

(A hand grabs her shoulder from behind. The woman gasps as she spins around. A young man is standing there. He chuckles as he holds up his cellphone)

MAN

Yeah. Seriously. You're so busted.

(The woman and man are walking on a dark road, animal sounds can be heard in the background)

WOMAN

You are beyond lame, you know that?

Let's just go back. Please?

I'll get you in.

Ever had a Moscow Mule?

MAN

A Moscow Mule? (Scoffs)

Will you just, for once, act your age?

WOMAN

Says the guy who doesn't even have his own car.

MAN

Stop hounding Mom about buying us a car, all right? She's doing the best she can.

WOMAN

Two more years, I am so gone.

(Branch snaps)

WOMAN

Hold up! Did you hear that?

MAN

Yeah. They're called animals.

WOMAN

Let's just go back into town.

MAN

No, Hayden, we're going.

HAYDEN

Have you, like, never seen a horror movie?

Two kids, dark road, creepy noise in the woods?

We keep walking...and boom!

BOY

You are such a drama queen.

All right, there's nothing there.

WOMAN

But I –

MAN

No, fine. I'll prove it.

(Man starts walking further down the road)

WOMAN (Singsongy)

Sucker.

(The woman turns back the way they came and texts 'Coming right back'. The man continues to walk, using his cellphone as a light.)

MAN (calling out)

See? Told you.

(Hayden screams and the man runs back to her, finding her laying on the ground)

MAN

Hayden!

Hayden...

(Stammers) No.

Oh, my God. Hay.

Help!

Hayden, Hayden, Hayden, Hayden.

(A growl comes from behind the man. He turns and sees a figure in black from head to toe with a white skeleton skull on the face mask. The figure lunges forward and stabs the man in the stomach.)

Aah!

(Squishing sounds and gasping)

(The figure turns towards Hayden and growls)

ACT ONE
(Sam and Dean are waiting, impatiently, in the British Men of Letters bunker.)

DEAN

All right, that's it. I'm waiting in the car.

SAM

Dean, dude, wait a second.

DEAN

No. You know what?

Getting jobs from these dicks is one thing, but I didn't sign up for this reporting for duty crap, especially when they're late.

MICK

Sorry I'm late.

(Door locks, beeps)

My report to the home office ran long. We've had our hands full since...

(Dean and Mick look down at a blood stain on the floor)

Well, best not to dwell on that.

DEAN

Wow. That is some world-class repression. You are British.

MICK

We prefer to call it a stiff upper lip.

SAM

Okay, okay. Enough.

Mick, what's the deal with the bat signal?

MICK (Sighs)

There was an incident in Wisconsin.

'Animal attack.'
(Mick hands Sam a gray folder)

MICK

A girl named Hayden Foster's in the hospital, and her brother lost his heart.

Looks like a werewolf.

SAM

Well, they don't usually leave behind survivors.

DEAN

Freak probably got spooked before it could finish the job.

MICK

Well, perhaps.

But it usually takes more than a fright to put your average werewolf off his supper.

DEAN

Oh, you'd know that, would you?

MICK

Actually, I would. I did extensive research into lycanthropy at Kendricks.

(Mick walks across the room and pulls two books out of a cabinet)

SAM

Kendricks?

MICK

The Kendricks School. It's where the British Men of Letters train their operatives.

It's like our --

SAM

Hogwarts?

(Mick places one book on the table and hands one to Sam)

MICK

Exactly.

Kendricks is the largest collection of occult lore in the world.

SAM

Cool.

(Sam looks to Dean enthusiastically. Dean is unimpressed.)

MICK

So when it comes to werewolves, I'm not entirely ignorant. For example, we know that last night's attack didn't happen on a full moon.

Therefore, we're looking for a pureblood.

DEAN

You think?

It's like a milk run to me.

MICK

Then you don't mind if I tag along?

SAM

Mick, um...

Listen, I-I don't think... I don't think it's really your kind of thing.

MICK

Oh, no, maybe it should be.

I had the best team, but most of us, we were thinkers, not fighters.

And let's be honest – you and your mum, you're the only reason I'm still alive.

DEAN

So now you wanna be like us?

MICK

No. I just want to be ready for whatever's next.

(Sam and Dean are in the hallway while Mick packs up in the main room)

DEAN

Dude, he is dead weight, and you know it.

SAM

Look, Mick's inexperienced, sure. But these people have some serious knowledge.

DEAN

So? Dude, what we do, you can't learn this crap in a book. You put on a flannel, you pick up a gun, you go out there.

Either you get good fast or you get dead faster.

SAM

We're working with these people now and – and we're getting wins. We're saving people.

The better they are, the better we are.

Look, Mick held his own with the Alpha. Why not give him a shot? Maybe he'll come in handy.

DEAN

And what if he gets himself killed?

MICK (off-screen)

I heard that.

(Mick approaches Dean)

DEAN

Good.

If he's coming, you're babysitting him. (points at Sam)

(Sam and Dean are driving down the road at night in the Impala. Sam is shining a flashlight on the book Mick gave him. Mick is in the backseat listening to his cellphone.)

MAN

In Luther's 27th thesis, the word "jingle" is an obvious nod to a canny 15th century monk...

(Speaking indistinctly)

DEAN

Had to let him listen to his podcast, huh?

(Stops podcast)

SAM

Dude, it's educational.

And besides, I've been wanting to listen to this one.

MICK

You know, monks like Martin Luther are among the earliest Hunters. He even wrote parts of that book you're holding.

SAM

What? This lore dates back to the 16th century?

MICK

Yeah. Well, in Europe, everything’s old.

Though we do have our fair share of new tricks for dealing with wolves – sulfate gas, silver nitrate lethal injection.

DEAN

Take a handful of silver bullets over any of that fancy crap.

MICK (sighing)

Yes, well, thanks to that "fancy crap," Britain's last werewolf outbreak was in the '20s.

We rooted them out, bitten and pureblood alike.

SAM

Wait a second. You killed them all? Even the ones that weren't hurting anyone?

MICK

Sorry?

SAM

I mean, werewolves aren't like most monsters.

Some can control it. I mean, we – we have a buddy got bit.

Nothing but beef hearts ever since.

MICK

And you trust him?

Well, killing is a fundamental need for werewolves. And monsters don't just stop being monsters.

DEAN

Well, Garth did.

MICK

Oh, turn here.

(The Impala pulls in front of the 'Wild Elk Lodge'. Sam, Dean and Mick get out of the car)

SAM

This place, uh, seems a little...

MICK

Shabby? Yeah.

Three stars was the best I could do. Least our bean counters will be happy.

Booked us all suites.

SAM

Wait, you... We're in separate rooms?

MICK

Yeah, of course.

DEAN

You say three stars?

MICK

Yeah.

DEAN

So we're talking fresh towels, little baby shampoos?

MICK

Uh-huh. And I believe there's a pool.

BELLMAN (opening the door)

Welcome, sir. Mm-hmm.

MICK

Cheers, mate.

DEAN (tosses the keys to Sam)

Get the bags.

(Sam grunts as he 'bobbles' the keys. In the lobby of the hotel, Dean grabs two fistfuls of mints from a jar on a desk and shoves them in his pocket.)

(The following morning Sam and Dean exit the hotel and stand outside)

DEAN (to the bellman)

Thanks.

(to Sam) Man. Those pillows, right?

The little chocolates that they put on? I mean, I'm ruined, Sam.

Those limey sons of bitches ruined me. I even took a swim this morning.

SAM

You brought a swimsuit?

DEAN

No.

SAM

Ugh.

DEAN

What'd you get up to?

SAM

I read through more of Mick's lore books.

DEAN

Really? Wow. Those three stars are wasted on you.

SAM

Anyways, listen to this. It's crazy.

So apparently, back in the '30s, they were working on this treatment for werewolves. This, like, blood therapy.

(Mick joins Sam and Dean)

MICK

Plasma therapy. Useless, I'm afraid.

So how were your accommodations, lads?

(The Impala's engine is heard purring as the valet pulls up to the front of the hotel)

DEAN

I've had better night's sleep in my baby.

(Engine idling)

DEAN

Get in. Let's go.

(Dean leans over to Sam as Mick gets in the car)

DEAN

Not gonna give him the satisfaction.

(Scene change to Hayden's hospital room. A nurse is checking the monitors and a woman is at her bedside. Sam, Dean and Mick approach the entrance to the room. The nurse leaves and Mick goes to enter)

SAM

Wait, wait. Let us.

Talking to a grieving family, it's tougher than you think.

MICK

Oh, I'm a quick study.

DEAN

Well, good for you. Okay, stay here, keep watch.

Anything comes up...I don't know, whistle.

SAM

Ms. Foster? Sorry to bother you.

Agent McVie.

This is my partner, Agent Fleetwood.

Um, we'd like to ask your daughter a few questions.

MRS FOSTER

She's sleeping.

DEAN

We'll be quick. Promise.

MRS FOSTER

I said no.

Hayden needs her rest. She's...

(Mick enters the room wearing a white doctor's coat)

MICK

Good morning. And how is our patient today?

MRS FOSTER

I'm sorry. Who are you?

MICK

Dr. Buckingham. Hayden's attending doctor, Dr. Markum, asked me to look in on her.

Um, would it be okay to ask you just to step outside for a moment?

MRS FOSTER

I, um...Of course, Doctor.

SAM

Sure.

MICK

Thank you.

(In the hallway, Dean hands Mrs. Foster a cup of coffee)

DEAN

Here. Please.

MRS FOSTER

Thank you.

DEAN

No problem.

MRS FOSTER

I'm sorry, about all that.

SAM

Oh, please.

After what you've been through, you have no reason to apologize.

(In the room, Hayden wakes up)

HAYDEN

Where's my mom?

MICK

Your mum's just outside.

Just gonna take a quick look, make sure you're okay.

Brave girl.

(Mick pulls back a bandage on Hayden's arm to reveal two nasty slices)

HAYDEN

I don't know what happened. It was so fast.

MICK

You've had quite a shock.

(In the hallway)

MRS FOSTER

I just – I don't even know what my kids were doing out there.

You know, Hayden was supposed to be sleeping at her friend's house, and – and Ben...

(Inhales and exhales sharply)

I just keep thinking this is a nightmare, you know? That I'm gonna wake up.

(In the hospital room Mick pulls a bandage of Hayden's other arm to reveal a long gash)

MICK

Okay.

(In the hallway)

MRS FOSTER

I'm just glad the FBI is here, not those crazies.

DEAN

Crazies?

MRS FOSTER

Bigfoot truthers.

Calling, sending e-mails. They thought Hayden was...

Like I said. Crazy.

DEAN

Huh.

MRS FOSTER

Some girl even came by here saying she was from the Fish and Wildlife Service.

(Scoffs)

Barely as old as Hayden.

I mean, like I'm gonna buy that.

(Sam looks towards Dean, raising his eyebrows)

SAM

You remember what she looked like?

MRS FOSTER

Yeah. Blonde. Bad attitude.

I actually – I have her card right here.

DEAN

Good.

(In the hospital room Mick pulls back another bandage and sees a deep bite mark on Hayden's arm)

MICK

Ah. (sighs heavily)

(Hayden wakes up as he replaces the bandage)

MICK (Softly)

Okay. You're okay.

You relax, okay?

(Mick joins Sam, Dean and Mrs. Foster in the hallway)

MRS FOSTER

Is she...

MICK

Wound's healing up nicely. Nothing too serious.

MRS FOSTER

Oh, that's so –

Thank you so much.

MICK

Pleasure. Excuse me.

(Mrs. Foster goes back into Hayden's room)

DEAN (sarcastically)

Doc?

SAM

So?

DEAN

Was Hayden bit?

MICK

No. No, she's a lucky girl.

SAM

Good. What about, uh, Fish and Wildlife Service?

Think it's another hunter?

DEAN

Young, blonde, pissed off. Sound like anybody we know?

(Scene changes to Claire leaning against her car outside a 'Gas 'n Sip'. She's reading a text message from Jody that says 'How's the trip? Go Badgers?')

CLAIRE (texting back to Jody)
'Campus is nice.'

(A cellphone rings from inside the car. Claire rushes to answer it)

CLAIRE

Hello? Uh, this is Agent Beatrice Quimby.

(A man's voice is heard speaking with an exaggerated Canadian accent)

Oh, thank God. There's a bear. It's the size of a freakin' tank!

(The same voice imitates [Yogi Bear]

I think it wants my pic-a-nic basket!

CLAIRE

Mm-hmm.

Hi, Dean.

(Sam, Dean and Claire are sitting in the lobby of the Great Elk Lodge)

DEAN

So Fish and Wildlife? Really?

SAM

Claire, what are you doing here?

CLAIRE

Same as you. Werewolf case.

(Mick approaches and places four beer bottles on the table)

MICK

Now. Beers all around.

CLAIRE

Who are you?

MICK

Oh. Mick Davies.

(Mick reaches out and shakes Claire's hand. She looks confused and amused)

Men of Letters. British.

DEAN

Long story. And, like, "Downton Abbey" boring, so...

(Claire leans forward and reaches for a beer. Dean leans forward and takes it from her)

DEAN

No. Unh-unh.

CLAIRE (sighs)

Okay. Anyway...

I've been on this a day. And guess what?

The girl, Hayden?

Her story about what happened the night of the attack? One big lie.

SAM

Her mom said the same thing.

DEAN

Where was she?

CLAIRE

She was at the local dive bar, gettin' trashed.

I tracked her phone and asked around and...

(Mick takes a sip of his beer and grimaces)

CLAIRE

Bartenders love me. It's a gift.

SAM

Right. You get anything else?

CLAIRE

The guy I talked to was a scumbag. Tribal tat, motorcycle, grabby.

DEAN (annoyed)

Grabby?

(Bell dings in the background)

CLAIRE

I'm a big girl. I handled it.

MICK (standing up)

Right. Think I'm gonna call it a night.

SAM (looking at his watch)

D-dude, it's 5:30.

MICK

Yeah, but my report's due at 6:00 sharp.

All work, no play.

(to Claire) Nice meeting ya.

(Light jazz playing in the background)

CLAIRE

So, your foreign exchange student is totally lame.

DEAN

Yeah. He's Sam's best friend.

(Sam sighs deeply)

They're like nerd soul mates.

SAM

Anyway, why are you alone?

CLAIRE

Jody's busy with sheriff stuff. And she said to call if I found anything.

SAM

So you called her?

CLAIRE

You called first.

And she's great, by the way. And so is Alex.

So, should we go to the morgue?

DEAN

Take it easy, Clarice. Morgue's closed.

SAM

By the way, when's the last time you had a hot meal that didn't come from a-a Gas-n-Sip microwave?

DEAN

Not that there's anything wrong with that.

CLAIRE

It's been a while.

DEAN

Well... (Clears throat and hands Claire a menu that was on the table)

Go nuts. It's on, uh, Harry Potter.

CLAIRE

(Laughs) Cool.

(Scene change to Hayden's hospital room. She's sleeping and Mrs. Foster kisses her on the head, leaves the room and walks down the hallway. As she leaves, Mick (in his doctor's coat) enters the room. He stands by her bed and pulls a large syringe out of his coat pocket. Monitors are beeping steadily in the background)

MICK (Whispering)

I'm sorry.

(As he injects the syringe into Hayden's IV line, the clouds clear and the moon shines in the window. Hayden's eyes pop open and turn yellow. Her nails grow into long, black points. She attacks Mick, shrieking and growling. He turns quickly and plunges the syringe into her chest. She falls to the floor with the syringe still stuck in her. Her eyes turn back to brown as she stops breathing.

Mick leaves the room clutching his shoulder which has been clawed in the fight with Hayden. As he heads down the hallway Mrs. Foster and some nurses enter Hayden's room)

MRS FOSTER (screaming)

No!

(Sobbing) No!


ACT TWO
(Sam, Dean, Mick, Claire (all wearing suits) and a doctor are in Hayden's hospital room They are standing around a gurney with Hayden's body on it.)

DOCTOR

Thanks for coming by so quickly. Ms. Foster gave us your number.

DEAN

You have any idea what happened to her?

DOCTOR

Autopsy's tomorrow, but it could be an arterial embolism, cardiac arrest.

SAM

A heart attack at her age?

DOCTOR

It gets weirder.

When we admitted her, she had defensive wounds to her arms.

Now... (the doctor pulls back a blanket covering Hayden, exposing her arms) they're gone.

(Cellphone rings)

DOCTOR (walking out of the room)

Just, uh, give me a second.

SAM

Sure.

CLAIRE

Okay...what the hell?

DEAN

You checked Hayden out. Did you notice anything weird?

MICK

No, but, uh, the girl could've had internal injuries or...

SAM

But somehow, her external injuries all healed? No way.

This is almost like, uh...

You know, what if she turned?

DEAN

What, like, "wolfed out" turned?

CLAIRE

Explains the whole Wolverine healing factor thing.

DEAN

Yeah, no, but that'd be crazy because that means she would've been bit.

And Mick here says that that didn't happen.

Right, Mick?

MICK (looking nervous)

Uh...

Uh, no, not – not that I saw.

SAM

Are you 100%?

MICK

Unless I made a mistake.

DEAN

Hell of a mistake.

SAM

Dean...

DEAN

No, I told you we shouldn't have dragged him along.

I told you!

CLAIRE

Don't!

Whatever got Hayden is still out there.

DEAN

Okay.

So let's say the night of the attack, wolf ices big bro, chomps down on a little sis, and then...poof, vanishes?

Does that make any sense?

SAM

Maybe he let her go.

CLAIRE

On purpose? Why?

MICK

Perhaps he didn't want her dead. He wanted her turned.

SAM

Right. Which means this wasn't random.

DEAN

Which means it would've been somebody who knew her.

Friends, family.

CLAIRE

Or someone from the bar.

DEAN

Okay. All right, Sam, you and Claire, you go talk to the girl that she was supposed to be crashing with, and me and amateur hour will hit the bar, see what shakes loose.

(Sam and Claire are sitting in her car, Claire is fishing around in the backseat and pulls out her headphones and places them around her neck)

SAM

So... (Sighs) really? Things are good?

CLAIRE

Yeah. They're awesome.

SAM

Really? You sure?

CLAIRE

Dude, take the yes.

SAM

Okay. (Sighs)

CLAIRE

So, you wait here.

SAM

What?

CLAIRE

Sam, no offense, but who do you think the kids are gonna wanna talk to?

Me, or some old skeezer?

(Sam looks offended)

CLAIRE

Exactly.

Be right back.

(Claire leaves the car and walks towards the high school)

SAM

Skeezer?

(Scene change to Dean and Mick walking along the sidewalk towards the bar)

MICK

Dean, what happened back there...my mistake, it won't happen again.

DEAN

Better not.

(Mick goes to open the door but pulls his hand back, sighing)

DEAN

Problem?

MICK

The old carpal tunnel.

DEAN

Well, allow me, your lordship.

MICK

Thanks.

(Dean opens the door and he and Mick enter the bar. The bartender is unpacking bottles of alcohol from a box)

DEAN

Howdy.

(Dean shows his FBI badges)

Agent Strummer. This is Agent Vai.

BARTENDER

Uh, hi.

(Mick places his phone on the bar. There is a picture of Hayden on it)

MICK

Do you recognize this girl? She was here three nights ago.

BARTENDER

Yeah. Not really.

DEAN

Yeah, I'd lie if I served underage girls, too.

(Dean stares at the bartender pointedly)

BARTENDER

Look, man, I... (Sighs)

I really need this job. I... (Inhales deeply)

(Sighs)

(Dean continues to stare)

She started coming in a few weeks ago after Conner got hired.

MICK

Conner?

BARTENDER

Yeah, the other bartender. They're having a thing.

DEAN

What kind of a thing?

(A door opens and closes in the background. A man in a white t-shirt walks around the bar. He has a large, tribal-type tattoo on his neck)

BARTENDER

Ask him.

DEAN

Hi, Conner.

Oh. Nice ink.

So you like high school girls, do you? Hmm?

(Conner looks surprised and confused)

You get older, they stay the same age. Is that it?

CONNER

That's not how it was.

(Dean, Mick and Conner are now sitting at a bar table)

MICK

Oh, so you weren't dating Hayden Foster?

CONNER

Dating? No, I let her in from time to time.

She is stupid hot. Okay?

But that's it. I swear.

DEAN

And the night she got attacked, did you let her in that night, too?

CONNER

Look, I don't know what happened.

I was behind the bar the whole night.

I didn't even see her leave.

DEAN

Hmm.

And then what'd you do?

CONNER (looks from Mick to Dean, questioningly)

Guess I went home.

DEAN

You guess?

Well, it's a simple question, Conner.

I ask what you were doing, then you tell me.

For instance, what were you doing last night?

(Dean turns toward Mick)

MICK

Me?

DEAN

Yeah.

MICK

Oh, I was writing my report.

DEAN

And then?

MICK

Well, I watched an episode of "The Great British Bake Off" and went to bed.

DEAN

Ha! See?

Simple.

CONNER (defensively)

I went home, man.

And I didn't do anything to that girl, okay?

DEAN

Yeah. Well, we'll see.

(Dean gets up as if to leave and then turns back towards Conner)

Oh, one more thing. Um...

Did you happen to meet a, uh, blonde girl the other night?

About yay high. Feisty?

CONNER

Yeah, yeah. Said she was Hayden's cousin.

Crazy bitch threw a beer at me.

DEAN

Huh. Well, from what I heard, you earned it.

CONNER

What are you, her dad?

Dude, come on. Girls like that? (Snorts, laughs)

Yeah.

DEAN

You ever touch her again, (Dean leans in to speak directly into Conner's ear) I'll break your face.

(Dean and Mick leave the bar and walk down the sidewalk)

Nice work in there.

MICK

Thank you. Yeah, that alibi –

I almost bought it.

MICK

Sorry?

(Dean stops walking and turns towards Mick, stopping him with his arm across Mick's stomach)

DEAN

See, here's the thing about 16-year-old girls, especially 16-year-old freshly minted werewolf girls – they don't just die.

And you've been acting sketchy all day.

MICK

Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.

(Dean grabs Mick's injured shoulder and squeezes hard)

MICK

Oh! (Groans)

DEAN

What did you do to her?

MICK

I did what needed to be done.

DEAN

And that means?

MICK

(Grunts) Last night, I injected her with silver nitrate. (Groans)

DEAN

So you killed her?

MICK

Well, she attacked me.

She tore up my shoulder. And... (Sighs)

I had orders.

DEAN

You had a choice.

MICK

Did I?

Killing monsters is what we do. Or maybe palling around with demons and witches, you've forgotten.

(Dean pushes Mick back against a railing and points a finger at him)

DEAN

Don't tell me how to do my job.

MICK

Well, then do it.

DEAN

You think it's that simple, huh?

MICK

I really do.

DEAN

Yeah?

I used to think the same thing.

Well, here's a little tip. Things aren't just black and white out here.

All you have is a case in front of you, like Hayden.

A few months ago, there was this kid, this psychic.

(Flashback to Magda flailing herself as her mother watches. Magda grunts in pain)

She was killing people, but she didn't mean to hurt anyone.

She was being abused.

So we gave her a second chance because it was the right thing to do.

MICK

Well... (Grunts) that's your luxury.

We have a code.

(Flashback to Magda getting off the bus and going into the bathroom. Silenced gunshots are heard. As the shooter leaves the bathroom, Magda is lying dead on the floor. A cellphone rings and Ketch answers)

MAN's VOICE ON PHONE

Thank you, Mr. Ketch.

DEAN

Well, now Hayden's mom, she gets to bury two kids instead of one, thanks to you and thanks to your code.

Nice work.

(Dean walks away from Mick. Mick grimaced and sighs heavily)

(Scene change to Claire walking away from the high school. Sam is leaning against her car as she approaches)

CLAIRE (smiling)

I was kidding before, but you really do look like a creeper.

SAM

Funny. How'd it go?

CLAIRE

BFF found. Beans spilled.

Hayden was hooking up with this older guy on the DL, and she was really into him, but he was a total stalker.

Texting constantly, ultra possessive.

Skeeved her friend out so much she narc'd to Hayden's brother.

SAM

Guess that explains why he was there.

CLAIRE

I did good, right?

(Claire walks around the car and opens the driver side door. Sam stands up and turns towards her)

SAM

Claire, why does Jody think you're in Madison looking at colleges?

CLAIRE

You called her?

(long pause)

Did you tell?

SAM

No. Not yet. But why are you lying to her?

CLAIRE (closes the car door)

Look, I-I know, okay? I know how much I owe Jody.

But we tried the whole hunting thing, and I just ended up sitting in the car while she does everything.

SAM

Guess she's taking it slow.

CLAIRE

She wants me to be normal, go to nursing school like Alex.

SAM

Did she actually say that?

CLAIRE

She doesn't have to. I'm better off on my own. This way, everybody's happy.

SAM

Claire, Jody's not gonna be happy when she finds out.

And if something happened to you...

CLAIRE

I'm careful!

SAM

You need to tell her the truth.

CLAIRE (walks toward Sam)

You know what? Screw you.

I'm so sick of you guys dive-bombing my life, pretending like you care.

SAM

We do care.

CLAIRE (raising her voice)

Then stop treating me like a stupid kid!

SAM

Then stop acting like one.

(Claire walks away and Sam shakes his head, as if regretting his words)

SAM

Claire...

(Claire is walking down a path towards the school field. Music is playing in her headphones)

♪ ...everything

♪ Opportunities for eternity ♪

♪ And I could belong to the night ♪

♪ Then your eyes, your eyes ♪

♪ I can see in your eyes ♪

♪ Your eyes ♪

♪ Everything in your eyes ♪

♪ Your eyes ♪

(There is a crunching noise and Claire stops walking and pulls her headphones down. We continue to hear the music as she starts looking around)

♪ You make me wanna die ♪

♪ I'll never be good enough ♪

♪ You make me wanna die ♪

(She turns around and sees the same masked, figure that attacked Hayden. Claire pulls a switchblade out of her pocket. The figure lunges towards her but she turns out of the way and faces the figure.)

♪ ...you love will burn up in the night ♪

(The figure lunges again and Claire makes several attempts to cut it with her knife. He grabs her wrist, pulls her arm behind her, shoves her to the ground and sits on her back)

♪ Look inside your eyes ♪

(Claire is screaming and the figure is growling)

♪ You make me wanna die ♪

(Claire screams as the figure leans forward and bites her on the back of her shoulder)


ACT THREE
(Claire is lying on the ground gasping in pain. Her headphones and knife are on the ground next to her. She sits up a little to reach around her shoulder and we see a large, bloody bite)

CLAIRE

Oh, my...

(Claire looks at her hand and sees the blood from her wound. She falls back to ground, gasping in pain.

CLAIRE

Aah!

(Claire rolls her head to the side and blurrily sees someone running down the path towards her. She rolls over and struggles to grab her knife off the ground. As she rolls back over Sam comes into her line of site, grabbing her hands)

SAM

Claire. Claire.

Hey. Hey. Claire.

Hey, it's me. It's me.

(Claire whimpers as Sam pulls her into a sitting position and puts his arms around her)

SAM

It's me. I gotcha. I gotcha.

I gotcha. You're safe.

(As he holds her he sees the wound on her shoulder and looks around angrily)

(Scene change to Sam, Dean, Mick and Claire in a hotel room. As Dean talks off screen, Claire is sitting on the bed, looking at a bandage on her shoulder)

DEAN

We gotta cool her off. She's burning up.

MICK (grabbing a blanket)

No. No, no, keep her warm.

SAM (turning angrily towards Mick)

Back off.

DEAN

Shut up.

MICK

Look, I understand you're angry –

SAM

Mick, you killed a kid. We're not angry. We're done!

CLAIRE

How long have I got until...

SAM

Sometimes it takes a full moon.

Sometimes it just takes time.

(Sam inhales shakily)

(Claire sniffles)

DEAN (kneeling down in front of Claire)

Hey.

Hey, listen to me.

Look, nobody said this was gonna be easy, okay?

But you can live with this.

(In the background, Sam sits at the table and opens a book)

CLAIRE

No way.

DEAN

Hey. Look, so you – you have to stay locked up a few nights out of the month, okay?

The rest of the time, you're you.

CLAIRE (whispering)

Unless I break out.

Maybe some people can control this, but I can barely keep it together on a good day.

(Voice breaking)

So if there's any chance I could hurt Jody or Alex...

or anyone...

(breathes shakily then raises voice)

I'd rather die.

SAM

Claire, there may be another way.

There's – there's the blood therapy that you talk about. (points at Mick)

MICK

I told you, it doesn't work.

SAM

It says right here, uh, (reading from the book)

1 out of 9 test subjects was cured.

CLAIRE

Cured?

SAM

Yes.

MICK

That study was on mice.

DEAN (standing up and walking towards Mick)

You want to tell me what the hell he's talking about?

MICK

We experimented with the blood of sire werewolves.

And we found it was possible to reverse the early stages of lycanthropy...in rodents.

SAM

So you never tested on humans?

MICK

Once.

SAM

And?

MICK

The subject died in agony.

Sorry.

CLAIRE

Yeah.

Maybe second time's a charm.

DEAN (turning towards Claire)

Hey, no, no.

You don't get a vote in this.

CLAIRE

It's my life. I get all the votes.

DEAN

Sam, you wanna back me up here?

SAM

It's her life.

DEAN

I bet you think this is a great solution. Hmm?

It works, or she dies.

Either way, one less monster, right?

MICK

I don't think there's any great solutions here.

CLAIRE (crying softly)

Dean...

Please? I can't.

DEAN

All right.

If we do this – if... how do we get it done?

MICK

We need blood, live blood, from the werewolf that bit her.

SAM

Good. Great. Who we lookin' at?

DEAN

Tribal tat. Back at the bar.

We shook him down about Claire, and right after, she gets bit.

That's not a coincidence.

SAM

Timeline fits, connection to both victims.

MICK

Then we should go. The full moon rises in less than an hour.

And if she turns and feeds, our cheery success rate drops to zero.

DEAN

Let's go.

(Sam, Dean and Mick walk towards the door. Dean stops and turns toward Mick)

Not you.

You stay with her.

SAM

You trust him?

DEAN

Mick's a smart guy.

So when I say that if anything happens to her, and I mean anything...

MICK

You'll kill me.

DEAN

Like I said, smart.

CLAIRE

Sam, if you're not back...

SAM

We'll be back.

(Sam and Dean leave the hotel room)


(Scene change to the exterior of the Ale House/Lucky Badger Bar. Conner walks out the door. The camera follows him from behind as he walks over to a motorcycle. As he goes to put on a helmet, Dean approaches)

DEAN

Yo.

(Den punches Conner in the face, pushes him up against a wall and the turns him around, holding him in place with an arm around his neck. Sam moves in holding out a knife)

SAM

All right, don't move, don't move. It's silver.

(Sam makes a small cut on Conner's hand)

SAM (looks surprised)

He's human.

(Scene changes to Claire looking out the hotel window as the full moon rises from behind the clouds. Animal calls can be heard)

(Mick sits down in a chair and fills a syringe with liquid from a bottle)

MICK

Let's give it time.

(Claire is breathing heavily. She grabs her stomach and bends over in pain)

CLAIRE

Aah! It burns!

(Claire grabs at her shoulder. She goes to the mirror and pulls off her bandage. As she turns to see the wound, it starts to disappear. She turns around and moves toward a gun on the table. Mick sees her and grabs it before she can)

CLAIRE

You don't understand. It's happening!

Give it to me!

MICK

No.

CLAIRE

Then you do it, please! It's happening!

And you don't understand how this feels!

(Mick points the gun at her)

MICK

I know a man who would shoot you right now without a moment's thought.

And every instinct I have says he's right... that I ought to do my duty.

(Flashback to Hayden laying on the floor in the hospital, gasping. Mick looks on as she dies)

MICK

But...

But my instincts haven't been so grand of late.

(Mick sighs) Sit down.

(Claire wraps herself in a blanket and sits on the couch, hugging her knees)

MICK

Now okay, here's what we're gonna do.

Firstly, we're gonna restrain you, right?

(Mick picks up leather straps)

For my protection. Okay?

And then...then we're gonna sedate you.

(Mick holds up a small brown bottle)

Also for my protection.

With any luck, when you wake up, this will all be over.

CLAIRE

If I wake up.

I gotta call Jody.

(crying softly) She's gonna be so mad at me.

(The door to the hotel room opens and the masked figure storms into the room)

MICK

Claire, get back!

(Mick goes after the figure and he is thrown across the room. Claire shatters a glass vase against his back. The figure faces her and pulls off its mask to reveal the original bartender. He punches Claire in the face. She falls unconscious to the floor and is seen being dragged away.


ACT FOUR
(Sam and Dean enter the hotel room and start looking around)

SAM

Claire?

(Mick, who was unconscious on the floor groans and starts to get up)

DEAN

Where is she?

MICK (standing)

The wolf, he took her.

DEAN (lunges at Mick and grabs him by his shirt)

What did I tell you?!

MICK

I tried to stop him, okay?

I can find her. I put a tracker in her pocket.

SAM (in disbelief)

You planted a bug on her?

MICK

Look, you can kill me later, after we find Claire.

(Scene change to nighttime exterior of a house. Inside, the bartender has Claire tied to a chair. He’s walking around, throwing items into a small duffle bag)

BARTENDER

I know this is sudden, but you and your friends, you should've let me have Hayden.

She was miserable here.

She...

We had big plans.

CLAIRE (straining against the ropes)

Yeah? Was that before or after you bit her?

BARTENDER

I had to know if she could survive the change.

Not everyone does.

(Claire pitches forward in the chair, groaning)

See?

It hurts at first, but eventually, it's like the best drug ever times a thousand.

CLAIRE

Right. Eat me, Teen Wolf.

BARTENDER

It's not like I want to do this.

My pack, we were happy. We didn't hurt anyone.

And then hunters with weapons that I've never seen before, they show up and...

(Claire groans again)

...take out 20 of us, just like that.

The ones that made it, we split up, but we weren't meant to live like that.

A werewolf needs his pack.

You'll see, I'm a nice guy.

CLAIRE

Yeah? You know who says they're a nice guy?

Clingy, insecure bitches with mommy issues.

BARTENDER (Walks over to the refrigerator)

That's just the change talking.

(He pulls a package off the shelf and walks over to Claire)

You'll feel better once you eat.

(He takes an animal(?) heart out of the package and shoves it in Claire's mouth)

Try it. You'll like it.

(Claire screams, muffled)

As soon as I saw you, I knew...you're just like me.

Alone.

(Claire spits the meat at the bartender, her mouth covered in blood)

CLAIRE

Wrong.

I have a family, and they love me.

(Claire pitches forward again, gasping in pain. When she sits up her eyes are glowing yellow and she stares at the bartender. Sam kicks in the door and tackles the bartender to the ground. Dean and Mick rush in after)

DEAN

Claire?

(Claire turns around, growling and showing her fangs)

DEAN

Claire.

Hey, all right. Easy.

(As the bartender and Sam continue to fight, Claire breaks the ropes holding her and goes after Dean. He picks up a pan and she swats it out of his hands, it crashes to the floor)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh!

(Sam punches the bartender and gets behind him, grabbing him around the chest)

SAM

Mick, hurry!

(Mick runs over and jabs something into the bartender's back. The bartender snarls, rears back and slams his head into Sam's. Sam falls back against some furniture and falls to the ground, unconscious. Mick moves in but the bartender throws him aside as well. As the bartender turns towards Dean, Claire lunges at Dean. He throws her against the refrigerator and she falls to the floor)

DEAN

Sorry, kid.

(The bartender lunges at Dean, grabs him and throws him to the floor. As he goes to move toward Dean, Mick shoots him in the back)

(Mick runs over and helps Dean up. He then grabs the ampule he stuck in the bartender's back, that is now filled with blood, and loads the blood into a syringe. Meanwhile, Claire wakes up and gets up from the floor, growling and snarling)

DEAN (to Mick)

Move, move, move, move, move.

DEAN

Claire. Claire.

(Sam wakes up and joins Dean and Mick standing opposite Claire. He's holding a backpack out in front of him)

SAM

Okay, Claire, it's us. You know us.

DEAN

That thing ready yet?

MICK

It's ready. It's ready.

Go, go, go.

DEAN

She wanted this, right?

SAM

Oh, yeah.

(Mick hands the syringe to Dean. Claire lunges at Sam who uses the backpack to protect himself and pushes Claire away from him. As she passes, Dean jabs her with the syringe. She falls to the floor screaming, then rises to her knees, growling and screaming)


ACT FIVE
(Claire is lying on the couch in the same house, convulsing, as Dean, Sam and Mick look on. Her voice alternates between werewolf snarls and her whimpering)

DEAN (standing up)

Gonna get some air.

(Dean walks out of the house. Claire writhes some more and then is completely still and silent)

SAM (looking despondent)

Claire?

Dean.

(Dean comes back inside. He looks on, as Claire's werewolf nails recede to her natural nails. There's a pause and then she opens her eyes)

CLAIRE You guys look like crap.

(Sam looks relieved and exhales audibly)

(Scene change to Sam, Dean and Mick leaving the hotel room. Dean hands the valet his ticket)

MICK (looking across the parking lot at Claire loading her car)

All right, give this to you.

That girl is a walking miracle.

DEAN

Yes, she is.

Listen, uh...thanks for the win back there.

DEAN

Yeah.

MICK

So we're good?

SAM

Not quite, but we'll give you a second chance.

DEAN

Just don't mess it up. There won't be a third.

MICK

Okay.

(Claire approaches)

SAM

Hey. How you feeling?

CLAIRE

Honestly?

I'm sort of craving a Milk-Bone right now.

(Sam and Claire chuckle)

CLAIRE

Look, um... what I said before... you guys are here when I need you and that's all that matters.

SAM

You gonna tell Jody what happened?

CLAIRE

I don't know.

DEAN

Well, whatever you decide, we got your back.

(Claire is standing next to her car, cellphone by her ear)

AUTOMATED MALE VOICE

Leave a message after the tone.

CLAIRE (nervously)

Hey.

It's me, Claire.

Okay, um, here it goes.

(As she’s talking, there is a flashback to Claire hugging Dean in front of the hotel, saying goodbye to him and Sam)

I've been hunting. Alone.

And I know it's not what you want to hear.

(Back to Claire next to her car)

And I know it sounds scary.

It scares me, too, sometimes, but... this is something I have to do on my own.

Just for a little while.

But I'm ready, and I never would've been if it wasn't for you being my mother.

Well, I better go. Um...

Tell Alex she better not touch my stuff.

I love you guys.

(Claire ends the call and drives away)
