[INTERIOR: Abandoned church. People are hanging from chains. One man is bound to a chair, bleeding slowly into a goblet. Footsteps approach and MICHAEL cuts a small slice in the man’s throat, which bleeds grace into the goblet full of blood. MICHAEL takes the goblet and nods approvingly.]

MICHAEL: A little of this...a little of that (adding more grace from a vial)...and…

[he swirls the goblet, then forces the man in the chair to drink]

Yes. Good boy.

[Michael watches as the man chokes and gasps, then flames out]

Hmm. Too much “that”. How disappointing.

[Michael drags the man’s body from the chair and drops it on the floor. We pan out to see a pile of bodies. He nods, then looks to the line of people in chains, spins his knife, and cheerily says]

Alright. Who’s next?

TITLE CARD

[INTERIOR: The Bunker. MARY and BOBBY are going over weapons.]

BOBBY: Who goes to Duluth in October. Sure Michael didn’t touch down in Orlando?

MARY: Jo was pretty specific. Duluth.

BOBBY: Yeah, well, angel’s ain’t exactly known for their veracity.

[MARY clears her throat and looks behind BOBBY, as CAS enters]

BOBBY: No offense.

CAS: None taken. I tend to agree with you.

[MARY hands a gun to SAM, who is at the computer]

MARY: Here you go.

SAM: Thanks.

MARY: Hey, what’s that?

SAM: So I’ve been searching through police reports in Duluth. Cops just turned up a pile of corpses that was dumped near some train tracks just north of town and their eyes were burnt out.

CAS: So Michael. We should go now.

SAM: No. This isn’t just Michael we’re talking about.

BOBBY: It’s Dean.

SAM: Yeah. Cas, you know why you can’t come with us, right?

CAS: My angelic presence would be sensed by Michael, thereby nullifying your hopes of a sneak attack.

SAM: Yeah, sorry.

CAS: And, you need me to stay here and babysit Nick and Jack.

SAM: It’s not babysitting, Cas.

CAS: Only in the sense that they’re not infants, but they both have to be supervised. Jack is lost without his grace, Nick is...he’s just a mess.

SAM: Well, it-it’s not his fault. Cas, Nick was housing, you know. He-he deserves a shot at rebuilding his life.

CAS: And yet every time I look at him, all I can see is the supreme agent of evil.

[JACK enters.]

JACK: You talking about my dad again? Look, I understand. Being around Nick - it’s hard for me, too.

MARY: Uh, Jack, we’re going to need you to sit this mission out. Not a permanent thing.

JACK: I know last time, I sucked when it mattered, and I need to improve. So...that’s what I’m gonna do.

SAM: Alright. Okay. [SAM cocks his gun]. Let’s move.

[SCENE: Dungeon in Bunker. Has been made up as a bedroom, with a devil’s trap on the floor under the bed in the center of the room. A man sits on the bed with his back to us.We zoom to NICK as he has flashbacks: LUCIFER killing with a snap in the Apocalypse World, LUCIFER killing the desk agent in Hammer of the Gods (5.19). NICK holds his head in his hands, breathing heavily. More flashbacks: LUCIFER killing GABRIEL in Hammer of the Gods. NICK’s flashback are interrupted by CAS knocking on the door.]

CAS, holding a tray: I brought you some nourishment. Now that he’s, uh, gone, you-you must remember to eat.

NICK: Right. Thanks. [Nick sighs and looks at CAS, who has his back to him.] I’m not him, Castiel.

CAS, sighing: I know.

NICK: But you still can’t look at me.

CAS: It’s difficult. You don’t remember all the things you did in his thrall, but I do.

NICK: I know. I just don’t - I don’t...get it. I don’t understand why I would do something like that, I don’t, I don’t get how I would let Lucifer possess me.

[Cas sighs and turns to face NICK]

CAS: You were in a lot of pain. And Lucifer saw vulnerability, and he, he exploited it.

NICK: Is that what you tell yourself so you can be near me?

CAS: I guess so.

NICK: I just don’t know what kind of pain would make me allow Lucifer to possess me.

CAS: It was your family.

NICK: My family? Sarah and Teddy?

[CAS nods.]

NICK, gasping: No. [NICK flashes back to Sympathy for the Devil (5.01). We see these scenes along with current NICK as he remembers]

SARAH, in flashback: It’s you, Nick. You’re special. You’re chosen. Nick, I need you to say “yes”.

NICK, in flashback: Then yes.

NICK, now: Oh my god. Who could do that? Who could do that?

CAS: A man broke in to your house, and you weren’t there.

NICK: That was no man. That’s not man. That’s a monster. It’s a monster, and then Lucifer found me and made me a monster, too. [sobbing] oh my god!

[SCENE: a morgue. Above shot as the CORONER pulls open the drawer to reveal the man from the first scene. BOBBY, MARY, and SAM watch.]

CORONER: These are just some of the victims. More are in the hall, a couple in a store room...we don’t usually see this kind of action in Duluth.

MARY: The injuries all pretty uniform?

CORONER: Yep. The boys upstairs think maybe we’re looking at a spree killer.

BOBBY: If they were DOA, you have an ETA on TOD? Any sample DFA?

[SAM clears throat.]
BOBBY: DNA?

CORONER: Uh, frankly we don’t even know the precise cause of death. I mean, there were the neck wounds of course, but there was also considerable internal trauma, so- [her cellphone rings] Excuse me.

SAM: Yeah. Sure. [SAM looks at BOBBY] DFA?

BOBBY: I’ve been fighting a friggin’ apocalypse for 15 years, my, FBI might be a little rusty.

SAM: Alright.

MARY: Let’s give them a quick once-over, see what they missed.

[They put on gloves and each move to a body]

BOBBY: Angel kills for sure, and not grunts. We’re talking 5-star smitings.

SAM: Knife slits in the throat, but it doesn’t appear they bled out.

MARY: He kept these people alive for a while.

[SAM opens the mouth of his corpse, the original guy]

SAM: Maybe these people aren’t people. Looking at a vamp.

BOBBY: Same here.

MARY: Me too.

BOBBY: Why milk ‘em if he’s just gonna smite ‘em?

MARY: Andy why is an archangel hunting vampires in the first place?

[CUT TO Coroner’s office. SAM knocks on the doorframe.]

SAM: Sorry. Excuse me. Um, did anyone come to claim or identify these bodies?

CORONER: Oh, yeah. A young lady. Said she heard about the killings on the morning news, thought she might know one of the victims.

MARY: And?

CORONER: She didn’t. Then she disappeared, never even gave us her last name.

SAM: Huh. Do you happen to have surveillance cameras outside?

[SCENE: the Bunker, main hall. JACK is seated at a desk as CAS enters]

CAS: Looks like about..two centuries of biblical lore. Light reading.

JACK: I’m researching how long it takes archangel grace to replenish.

CAS: Well, archangels being exceedingly rare, the data on that is woefully scant.

JACK: The books say it can take from a month to-

CAS: A century. Yeah. Complicating factor being your human component, which slows the process.

[a beat]

Jack, um...mourning what you’ve lost...it’s wasteful. Might be smarter to focus on what you still have.

JACK: You don’t understand what I’m going through.

CAS: Yes, I do - a little. At the time of the Great Fall, when angels were banished from heaven, I lost what I thought was everything. I had no grace, I had no wings. I felt hopeless and useless.

JACK: What did you have left?

CAS: Well, uh..well, I had Sam and Dean. But I had something else that was extremely helpful. I had myself. Just the basic me, as, uh...as Dean would say, without all the bells and whistles. You know, Sam and Dean, they weren’t born with their expertise. They’ve been at it since they were children. Failing, winning, developing over the years. Patience, persistence - those are skills too. The past, where you come from, that’s important, but it is not as important as the future and where you’re going.

[JACK looks thoughtful]

[SCENE: MICHAEL, dressed in a tux, buttons his sleeves and views himself in a mirror. He stills, and the mirror image moves as though in pain.]

DEAN, in mirror: GET...OUT.

MICHAEL: I don’t think so.

DEAN: You can’t.

MICHAEL: Oh, but I can. Because, see…[MICHAEL punches the mirror, and DEAN is gone] I own you. So hang on, and enjoy the ride.

[SCENE: CAS, in the Bunker, enters on the phone. Nick is in the room.]

CAS: That doesn’t make any sense, Sam. I’ve never heard of an interaction between an archangel and a vampire, certainly not in this universe. And … why would Michael be killing them? I mean, they’re not a threat to him. Yeah, okay. Well, just let me know what you find out.

Nick, are you, uh..

NICK: Nothing. Nothing. There’s nothing. There’s no information. There’s no mention of my wife and son past the year they were...when they died. There’s - there’s nothing about the case being solved. Nothing!

CAS: Oh, I’m sorry. I - I didn’t know that.

NICK: If I were around, I would have been on those cops every single day, Castiel. But I was out of my head with grief. I said yes to Lucifer. I was a coward, and now -

[CAS moves to put a hand on NICK’s shoulder. NICK surges up and snaps his fingers.]

NICK: Don’t.

[CAS backs away, hands raised.]

[A beat. Nick looks at his hand, CAS looks suspicious]

CAS: Why did you do that?

NICK: Do what?

CAS: What went through your head just now?

NICK: Um, I don’t know? Nothing? What are you - trying to get at?

CAS: Even though he’s departed, there may be some of his influence still within you. Just-

[CAS reaches out to touch NICK again. He lays his hand on NICK’s chest, and a look of concentration and concern cross his face. NICK look worried. CAS removes his hand.]

CAS: Lucifer may have inflicted more damage on your psyche than we suspected.

NICK: I don’t have time for this. I’m not letting this go, Castiel. [NICK turns and storms away] I’m gonna find out who killed my family.

CAS: Nick! And then what?

[NICK leaves]

[SCENE: a cheap apartment. A young woman, Lydia, lies on a bed, she looks up at pounding on the door]

LYDIA: Yes?

SAM, behind the door: Lydia Crawford, this is the FBI. Open up.

[LYDIA looks terrified, and runs for the window. SAM continues pounding on the door.]

SAM: Open up!

[SAM breaks the door open, gun drawn, and LYDIA turns away from the window. BOBBY and MARY follow him into the room]

SAM: Hey! Stop!

LYDIA: Get away from me!

SAM: Don’t move. We know who you are. We know you went to the morgue.

BOBBY: We saw your license plate on the security cams and pulled your address. You should’ve ditched the car when you first got turned. Made this way too easy.

LYDIA: You’re not FBI. You’re hunters.

SAM: That’s right.


[BOBBY pulls his knife.]

LYDIA: I haven’t done anything wrong!

BOBBY: No, vampires never do.

LYDIA: My nest, we - we fed on animal blood. [SAM lowers his gun] We lived quiet lives, until...until he came.

SAM: He? He who?

LYDIA: I don’t know his name, but..he was strong. He tied all of us up and one by one he’d take blood from us. I couldn’t see what he was doing, exactly, but every time there would be this explosion, and my friends would be dead. When he was coming for me, a couple of the others tried to att- tried to attack him. I was able to get away, but...they didn’t make it.

SAM: Why was he killing you? Did he say?

LYDIA: I don’t think he meant to. It-it’s just that ...things seemed to go wrong. He wasn’t killing, it was like...it was like he was experimenting.

BOBBY: Experimenting? What for?

LYDIA: That’s - that’s all I know.

BOBBY: Okay. [He advances on LYDIA with his blade raised] Nice chattin’ with ya.

LYDIA: Wait! Wait! I-I don’t know what he wanted, I-I don’t know who he was, but I do know where he is. If - if you let me go.

[SCENE: MICHAEL’s hotel room. He enters with a lovely woman.]

WOMAN: Thank you. Oooh, Very elegant. But then, so are you.

MICHAEL, chuckling: Thanks for showing me around. [He uncorks some wine and pours two glasses] I didn’t realize there was so much going on in...where are we again?

WOMAN: Duluth.

MICHAEL: Of course. Nothing like where I’m from.

WOMAN: What’s it like in your hometown?

MICHAEL: Hmm. Empty. Windswept. Dead bodies lying around.

WOMAN, chuckling: You’re so funny. What a nice surprise, meeting you. I bet you were wondering what I was doing, all by myself in that bar tonight.

MICHAEL: I’m pretty sure I know exactly what you were doing in that bar tonight.

WOMAN, setting glass down: Oh, Michael. I am so not that girl.

MICHAEL: But you really are, aren’t you?

WOMAN, reaching her arms around his neck: You’re terrible.

MICHAEL: You have no idea.

[WOMAN giggles, then moves her face up and werewolfs out, big teeth and green eyes. MICHAEL grabs her by the throat. His eyes begin to glow blue]

MICHAEL: Did you honestly think I didn’t know what you are? [He lifts her off the floor, still gripping her neck] You think you picked me? I picked you.

[He flings her across the room, and takes a sip of wine as she turns to him, still on the floor]

MICHAEL: Now, summon your master.

[SCENE: The Bunker main hall. CAS is flipping through a book, as NICK paces on the phone.]

NICK: Detective, my wife and son were murdered in Pike Creek, Delaware. You’re a police lieutenant in Pike Creek Delaware. If you can’t help me, who can? … Hello? [closes phone] You gotta be….You know what a cold case is, Castiel?

CAS: It's --

NICK: It’s a case too unimportant for anybody to care about. My wife and son are dead. Gone. Forever. My life is gone with them, and, uh, nobody cares. These cops don’t care.

CAS: I’m sorry, that sounds very difficult.

NICK: Difficult. Yeah, you know what’s difficult? No evidence. There’s no fingerprints, there’s no DNA, I mean how does that even happen? I mean there was a witness who came forward and said they saw someone coming out of the house, and then they said they didn’t see anything at all, and the case died. Like everything else.

CAS: Nick - you, on the other hand, you’ve been given a second chance. You’re not dead.

NICK: You don’t understand.

CAS: Oh, I do.

NICK: Why, because your body was stolen?

CAS: Because I am occupying someone else’s. All angels have to, in order to walk the earth. This...this was Jimmy Novak.

NICK: "Occupy." Sounds like a cleaned up way of staying "steal." And, uh, Jimmy? Is that his name? He all right with that?

CAS: Yes, he was.

NICK: “Was.”

CAS: Jimmy’s dead.

NICK: Castiel, you’re just a stone cold body snatcher. You’re no different than Lucifer.

CAS: I...I need to look in on Jack. [CAS walks past NICK, but stops before he gets to the door] You know, in all my thousands of years, what happened to Jimmy Novak and his family are my greatest regret.

[SCENE: MICHAEL’s hotel room. He hands a glass to a seated MAN, and then sits himself, next to the WOMAN from earlier.]

MAN: You first.

MICHAEL: One hundred year old cognac. Strong notes of vanilla and apricot... [He drinks] and zero notes of silver. [The MAN also drinks] I appreciate you accepting my invitation.

MAN: Yes, well, the ever-tactful Melanie [the WOMAN] thought a refusal might be unwise. She thinks you’re a god.

[both men chuckle]

MICHAEL: An archangel. But close.

MAN: And I’m the leader of a werewolf pack. Why on earth would an archangel care about us? About me?

MICHAEL: I admire you. Eating on the run, surviving, despite being stalked by those venal humans, who think of you as nothing but vermin.

MAN: My pack has survived and prospered for centuries, despite the humans.

MICHAEL: Yes, well, I’m new to town, and from my perspective the real monsters of this world, the ones that cheat, cover, lay waste to this planet, are the humans. Who made them top dog? Pardon the pun.

MAN: God, I suppose.

MICHAEL: God who? Between us, Phillipe, God’s on permanent vacation. Gone fishing. Demons and angels don’t seem to be much of a factor here, so, I’m in charge.

PHILLIPE: And what do you want from me?

MICHAEL: You and your kind, you are who you are. You kill, but not for sport, for trophies - to live. There’s a purity in that. Isn’t it time you had your due?

PHILLIPE: Our due?

MICHAEL: There are ways to enhance your - let’s call them "talents".

PHILLIPE: And these ways are…

MICHAEL: Fully tested. There were some misfires early, I will admit to that. But I have cracked the code.

PHILLIPE: And now what? Do you propose we wage a way on the humans, keeping only as many of them alive as we need for slave labor and a steady food supply? Because I love that world, but believe me, it’s an absurd dream.

MICHAEL: Is it? Why be the hunt-"ed", when you can be the hunt-"er", hmm?

[SCENE: sunny exterior. We hear a door knock. An grey haired woman opens the door to reveal JACK]

WOMAN: Can I help you?

JACK: Mrs Kline?

MRS KLINE: Yes?

JACK: I’m a friend...of your daughter. Kelly.

MRS KLINE: Oh. [A man, MR KLINE, comes up behind her.]

JACK: My name is Jack.

MR KLINE: So is mine!

JACK: I know.

MRS KLINE: Well please, come in. [Jack enters]

[CUT to the KLINE living room. MR KLINE and JACK are seated, MRS KLINE brings JACK a glass and sits as well]

JACK: I was in the area and wanted to say hello. [aside to MRS KLINE] Thank you. Kelly always had such nice things to say about her family.

MRS KLINE: So how did you know our Kelly? Through work?

JACK: She basically gave me her start.

MRS KLINE: So you were like her intern.

MR KLINE: Took you under her wing. That’s just like her. [both KLINES chuckle]

MR KLINE: We haven’t heard from her in a long time.

MRS KLINE: Well, she went travelling, but she couldn’t tell us where.

JACK: She really couldn’t.

MR KLINE: So it was part of her...government work. Classified and all that.

[JACK nods. MR KLINE also nods sadly. JACK notices a book on the coffee table]

MRS KLINE: Oh, please.

[JACK opens it to reveal pictures of KELLY as a girl]

JACK: Is that her?

MRS KLINE: Mhmm. Sixth grade. She won the spelling bee. "Chrysanthemum" was the winning word.

MR KLINE: Lucky. We grew ‘em in the yard.

MRS KLINE: Forgive me, but, uh - Kelly told us she was pregnant. We didn’t push for details, We felt she’d tell us more when she was ready.

JACK: She, uh, she had the baby. A boy.

[The KLINES laugh...and cry]

MRS KLINE: We have a grandson!

JACK: You do. And in the time I spent with her, she was an amazing mother. Her son loves her very much.

MRS KLINE: I can just imagine.

JACK: She would sing, and talk to him, even before he was born. She made him feel safe, and wanted. I heard her tell him that it isn’t fate, or her, or his dad who sets his path - it’s himself, who he chooses to be.

MRS KLINE: I know it’s nutty, but, Jack here kind of looks like her, see? [She holds up the book again]

JACK: I don’t know. But, I hope some day to have a little of her courage and purpose. I didn’t mean to intrude. [JACK stands to leave]

MRS KLINE: Oh, no, no, not at all.

MR KLINE: Hey, no.

JACK: I had to meet you.

MR KLINE: If you see Kelly, tell her we miss her.

JACK: I will. I miss her too.

[MRS KLINE hugs him. Tears all around]

[SCENE: LYDIA’s apartment. She is packing to leave. As she turns to grab another handful we hear WING SOUNDS and MICHAEL is sitting at her table]

MICHAEL, singsong: Lydia.

LYDIA: I didn’t.

MICHAEL: Of course you did. The hunters. [he stands] Why do you think I dumped your brothers and sisters in plain sight? Why do you think I let you escape?

LYDIA: You let me escape?

MICHAEL: Rule number one: you can’t have a trap without bait. That brings us to rule number two, which says once the trap has been sprung, you don’t need the bait any more. [MICHAEL’s eyes glow, and LYDIA flames out, screaming.]

[SCENE: Bunker, interior hallway. JACK and CAS are walking quickly through]

CAS: Jack, what were you thinking taking that kind of risk?

JACK: It wasn’t a risk.

CAS, sputtering: To-to go out there alone? Jack, you have been on the radar of every angel and demon and power broker in creation since the day you were born and I’m sorry, but you’re not exactly yourself.

JACK: Weak and defenseless, you mean.

CAS: I mean that the possibility of capture is real, yes.

JACK: I heard what you were saying, Cas, about me finding out where I came from. I never knew my mother. I thought the next best thing might be for me to meet the only real family that I have left.

CAS: That is not- [CAS visibly reins in his frustration] Well, did it help?

[JACK nods]

CAS: And you didn’t tell them who you were, did you?

JACK: Of course not. I...wanted to. I wanted to tell them I was their grandson. They thought I actually kinda looked like her? [CAS nods agreement] I..couldn’t tell them that she died. They just love her so much. I know I should have.

CAS: What you did you did from a place of kindness. I suppose there are worse ways to be human than to be kind.

JACK: Have you heard from Sam? Did they find Michael?

CAS: Yeah, they think so.

JACK: So they’re going to try to kill him?

CAS: Uh, no. No, the plan is subdue him using angel cuffs and spellwork. They have to get Michael out of Dean.

JACK: And if he doesn’t leave?

CAS: Then they’ll try to drive him out.

JACK: And if that doesn’t work?

CAS: Jack-

JACK: Cas, Michael has to be stopped.

CAS: I know, and he will be - after Dean is-

JACK: No, Dean doesn’t matter. You’re all so focused on trying to save Dean and I get it, I understand, but - if he can’t be saved, if it comes down to him or Michael - Michael has to be stopped. Caged, or killed-

CAS, shouting: And if that means that Dean dies too?

JACK: Then Dean dies. I know this Michael. I’ve seen what he’s done to an entire world, and so have you. If stopping that from happening here means that Dean has to die, then …. Do you think he’d want it any other way? [JACK leaves]

[SCENE: a pretty suburban house, exterior. Cut to living room. A man is pouring tea for NICK.]

MAN: Well, it is so good to see you after all these years. I mean, after that night you just disappeared, and I never knew what happened.

NICK: Yeah, after I lost my family I couldn’t stand being in that house one more minute.

MAN: Nick, I completely understand.

NICK: Do you?

MAN: I just hope these years have been healing and restful for you.

NICK: My whole family was slaughtered, Arty. There’s no restful for me anymore. Best thing I can hope for is that I catch the monster who did it.

ARTY: Well sure Nick, we all - we all want that.

NICK: Do you though, Arty? Cause you said you got a good look at the man who left my house, and then you changed your story.

ARTY: I had to, Nick, because there was no man. I mean, I - in the heat of the moment I guess I thought I saw something, I wanted so much to help, but I was wrong.

NICK, rising and walking to a window: Hmm. Is that the window you were looking out of?

ARTY: Ah-

NICK: What made you look out, Arty? You hear someone scream?

ARTY: I - I don’t really remember.

NICK: The man you saw, was he rushing out, or was he casual?

ARTY: Nick, I told you, I-

NICK; What, did he have a hammer? Cause that how the cops said he murdered my family, [voice breaking] he smashed their skulls over and over with a hammer.

ARTY: Nick, there was no man.

NICK: Oh, Arty. Who got to you? [He advances on ARTY]

ARTY: What, what?

NICK: Somebody get to you?

ARTY: N-no.

NICK: They pay you off?

ARTY: I mean - no!

NICK: Or were you just scared [NICK pins ARTY to the wall by his throat] Huh? Huh?

ARTY: I just remembered wrong that’s all there is to it.

NICK: My family deserves justice, do you understand me? I deserve justice! I’m going to get justice! Do you understand me, Arty?!

ARTY: I don’t know anything!

NICK: Oh, I think you do, Arty. I think you do.

[SCENE: an abandoned church, interior. SAM, MARY, and BOBBY enter]

BOBBY: You think vamp-girl was lyin’ about Michael hanging out here?

SAM: Not sure why she would. I mean she has every reason to want him dead.

MARY: She wasn’t lying about the slaughter happening here - whole lot of dried blood on the floor.

SAM: Why was he killing them? And what does she mean by "experimenting"?

BOBBY: Don’t look like he’s here.

[The stained glass windows shatter as werewolves break through them]

BOBBY: Werewolves!

[SAM unloads a round into one werewolf, to no effect]

SAM: Silver bullets aren’t working! Nothing’s working!

[SAM, BOBBY and MARY each fight with a different werewolf. SAM grabs a blade and decapitates one]

BOBBY: Well, that works.

[They continue fighting until all of the werewolves have been beheaded]

SAM: Is everybody okay? Anyone get bit?

MARY: No.

BOBBY: I’m okay. What the hell kind of werewolves were those?

MARY: Silver didn’t touch them.

[The doors open to reveal MICHAEL, backlit in red. He walks in slowly, raising his hand - which he then uses to grab a post as he staggers into the light, removing his cap as he does]

DEAN: Sammy. It’s me.

SAM: Dean is it really you?

DEAN: Yeah, it’s really me.

SAM: Are- are you okay?

DEAN: No, I’m not okay!

SAM: But you got Michael to leave.

DEAN: No, I- I don’t .. I didn’t.

BOBBY: What?

DEAN: He just - he just left.

SAM: Why?

DEAN: I don’t know. I don’t know.

[SCENE: ARTY’s living room. NICK is covered in blood, holding a hammer, which he drops on the table as he leaves. ARTY is very dead.]

END
