TEASER
INTERIOR. A COLD RAIN LASHES A LARGE COMFORTABLE HOUSE.

A man is in his study. He pours a whiskey and walks back and forth, looking worried. The phone rings and he jerks. He stares at it for a long moment then moves to pick it up. The phone's display shows 'SHA33'.

MAN
Hello.

WOMAN
Ben.

BEN
Linda.

LINDA
Ben, I had to talk to you...

BEN
You can't keep calling here.

LINDA
I know. I know, just...just tell me you thought about it please.

BEN
There's nothing to think about.

LINDA
Don't say that.

BEN
I can't. You know I can't. My wife....

LINDA
I'm begging you, come to me. Come to me, Ben.

BEN
No.

He hangs up. The phone immediately starts ringing again. BEN picks it up.

BEN
Linda. Please. Please leave me alone.

LINDA
I'm not going to stop. I miss you, Ben. We could be happy. We could be happy together.

BEN
This is...this is crazy.

LINDA
I love you! Forever. Don't you love me?

BEN
You know I do. More than anything. I'm sorry.

LINDA
Ben, wait....

BEN hangs up. The phone rings again. BEN picks up the receiver and slams it back down a number of times, then throws the whole phone across the room, the cord ripping out of the wall. BEN rubs his face and stares at nothing.

After a few moments the phone starts ringing again. BEN looks shattered. He slowly opens the desk draw and takes out a handgun. He stares at it for a few seconds then takes a deep breath.

BEN
Okay, Linda. You win.

He stares at the ceiling, then lifts the gun and places the barrel against his throat, pointing upwards. He cocks it.

BEN
I'm coming.

Close up of the phone screen spinning through letter and numbers and again landing on SHA33. A gunshot is heard, then the thud of something hitting the ground.

END TEASER

ACT ONE
SAM walks across a city square toward DEAN sitting on a bench.

DEAN
(Into phone) Yep. I got it. Okay, bye.

DEAN hangs up then in one motion picks up and throws an unopened can of soda to SAM, stands up and shoves the last of the food he is eating into his mouth.

DEAN
(Chewing) So?

SAM
So, the professor doesn't know crap.

DEAN
Shocking. Pack your panties, Sammy, we're hitting the road.

SAM
What? What's up?

DEAN
That was Bobby. Some banker guy blew his head off in Ohio and he thinks there's a spirit involved.

SAM
So you two were talking a case?

DEAN
No, we were actually talking about our feelings. And then our favourite boy bands. Yeah, we were talking a case!

SAM
So a spirit, what?

DEAN
Yeah, the banker was talking about some sort of electrical problems at his pad for like a week. Phone was going haywire, computer was flipping on and off.

SAM
Huh...

DEAN
This is not ringing your bell?

SAM
Well, sure, yeah. But, Dean, we're already on a case.

DEAN
Whose?

SAM
Yours.

DEAN
Right. Yeah. Well, you coulda fooled me.

SAM
What the hell else have we been doing lately other than trying to break your deal?

DEAN
Chasing our tails, that's what. Sam, we've talked to every professor, witch, soothsayer and two bit carny act in the lower 48. Nobody knows squat! And we can't find Bela, we can't find the Colt. So until we actually find something, I'd like to do my job.

SAM
Well there's one thing we haven't tried yet...

DEAN
Sam, no.

SAM
We should summon Ruby.

DEAN
I'm not gunna have this fight with you.

SAM
She said she knows how to save you.

DEAN
Well, she can't.

SAM
Oh really, you know that for sure?

DEAN
I do.

SAM
How?

DEAN
Because she told me, okay!

SAM
What?

DEAN
She told me. Flat out. She can't save me, nobody can.

SAM
And you just somehow neglected to mention this to me?

DEAN
Well, I really don't care what that bitch thinks and neither should you, so...

SAM
So what, now you're keeping secrets from me, Dean?

DEAN
You really wanna talk about who's keeping secrets from who?

They stare at each other in silence for a long moment. SAM turns away.

DEAN
Now where you going?

SAM
Guess I'm going to Ohio.

..........................

EXTERIOR. BEN'S HOUSE.

SAM and DEAN in the Impala turn into the driveway of the house where BEN died. Cut to the study.

WOMAN
(Pointing) I found him there.

DEAN
Why don't you tell us everything you saw, Mrs Waters.

MRS WATERS
You mean beside my dead husband?

SAM
Just everything else you saw. Please.

MRS WATERS
(Sighing) Blood. Everywhere. The phone was ripped from the wall, his favourite scotch on the desk, what else could you possibly want to know?

SAM
Why was the phone ripped from the wall?

MRS WATERS
I don't know.

SAM
You mind if I take a look?

MRS WATERS
I already went over this with the other detectives.

DEAN
We'll be out of your hair in no time, ma'am.

SAM
(Pressing a few buttons) Ma'am, what time did your husband die?

MRS WATERS
(Sighing) Sometime after 11.

SAM waits until DEAN looks at him, then taps the phone display.

DEAN
What about strange phone calls? Receive any of those lately, weird interference, static, anything like that?

MRS WATERS
(Defensively) No.

DEAN raises his eyebrows at her.

MRS WATERS
No!

DEAN
Mrs Waters, withholding information from the police is a capital offence.

SAM noisily clears his throat. DEAN glances at him and receives a bitchface.

DEAN
(Under his breath) In some parts of the world I'm sure.

MRS WATERS
(Sighing) A couple of weeks ago, uh....there was this...

DEAN
This what?

MRS WATERS
I woke up one morning, I heard Ben in his study. I thought he was talking to a woman.

SAM
What made you think that?

MRS WATERS
Because he kept calling her Linda. The thing is, I picked up the other line and nobody was there, Ben was talking to nobody.

SAM
There was nothing?

MRS WATERS
Just static.

SAM
Did you ever speak to Ben about this phone call?

MRS WATERS
No. I should have but...no.

SAM
Did he ever say who Linda was?

MRS WATERS
(Getting upset) What difference does it make, there was nobody on the other end!

The boys exchange a look.

............................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

DEAN is at the laptop, SAM sitting on the bed.

DEAN
Linda's a babe. Or, was.

SAM
(Rising) Did you find her?

DEAN
Yeah, Linda Bateman. She and Ben Waters were high school sweethearts.

SAM
So what happened?

DEAN
Drunk driver hit them head on. Ben walked away.

SAM
So, what then? Dead flame calls to chat?

DEAN
You would think, but Linda was cremated. So why's she still floating around?

SAM
You got me.

DEAN
What about that, uh, caller I.D?

SAM
Turns out, it's a phone number.

DEAN
No phone number I've ever seen.

SAM
Yeah, ’cause it's about a century old, back from when phones had cranks.

DEAN
So why use that number to reach out and touch someone?

SAM
Got me there too, but we should put a trace on it.

DEAN
Well how the hell are we going to put a trace on something that's over 100 years old?

..........................

INTERIOR. BASEMENT OFFICE

DEAN and SAM follow a suited man down the stairs and along a hallway.

MAN
We don't get many folks from HQ down here.

DEAN
Yes well the main office mentioned that there would be a lunch.

SAM gives DEAN bitchface behind the man's back. DEAN shrugs.

MAN
Well I'm sure we can arrange something. The man you wanna be speaking to is right this...

SAM swipes at a fly that has flown into his hair.

MAN
I know, sorry. We've got something of a hygiene issue down here if you ask me.

MAN
(Entering the basement office) Stewie? What did I tell you about keeping this place clean.

STEWIE sits at a large console with multiple screens and keyboards. Various packets and junk food are strewn about. STEWIE jumps at their entrance and desperately tries to close down the multiple screens in front of him showing advertisements for porn sites.

STEWIE
(Clicking quickly) Spam mail...spam mail...

MAN
Stewie Myers. Mr Campbell. Mr Raimi.

STEWIE
(Still clicking) I don't know how all this got here...

The MAN reaches out and flicks the back of STEWIE'S head, making him jump again and grunt.

MAN
From headquarters?

STEWIE spins around in his chair, then quickly crosses his legs and places his hands together on his lap.

MAN
Give these gentlemen whatever they need.

STEWIE
Yeah.

DEAN
Thank you.

SAM
Thanks.

The MAN leaves.

STEWIE
So....can I help you?

DEAN checks to make sure the MAN is gone, then gestures toward the screen.

DEAN
(Smirking) Is that, ahhh, BustyAsianBeauties.com?

STEWIE
(Quickly) No.

WOMAN ON COMPUTER
Oh, me so horny.

A shot of the screen shows it is bustyasianbeauties.com.

STEWIE
(Quickly clicking again) Maybe.

DEAN
A word to the wise? Platinum membership? Worth every penny. Ha? (DEAN nods knowingly)

SAM
Right, anyway. We're here to trace a number?

SAM hands STEWIE a piece of paper.

STEWIE
Where did you get this?

SAM
Off caller I.D.

STEWIE
Oh no, that's impossible.

DEAN
It hasn't been used in a few years, we know.

STEWIE
A few years? It's prehistoric. Trust me, nobody is using this number anymore.

SAM
Sure. Could you run it anyway?

STEWIE
(Snarkily) Sure. Why don't I just rearrange my whole life first.

DEAN and SAM glance at each other. DEAN smiles.

DEAN
(Leaning closer) Listen, uh, Stewie. You got like six kinds of employee code violations down here, not to mention the sickening porn that is clogging up your hard drive. Now when my partner says run the number, I suggest you run the number!

They both give Stewie a hard look. He looks between them then turns back to his console. DEAN grins and SAM shrugs and smiles back.

STEWIE
Okay, whatever, jeez!

STEWIE clicks a few more buttons. One of his screens fills with a long list of numbers.

STEWIE
Holy crap.

SAM
What?

STEWIE
I can't tell you where the number comes from, but I can tell you where it's been going.

SAM
What do you mean?

STEWIE pushes print, goes to the printer and hands some paper to SAM.

STEWIE
Ten different number in the past few weeks, all got calls from the same number.

He looks between SAM and DEAN as they stare at each other, then sighs and walks between them back to his console. He sits and stares at it for a moment, then looks back.

STEWIE
So, are we done here? Cause I was....sort of...busy?

DEAN
(Smirking) Right.

..............................

EXTERIOR. SUBURBAN STREET.

SAM gets out of a rental car. He makes his way up a footpath, knocking on the door. It is opened by a middle-aged man. His son comes to stand beside him, around 6-7 yrs old.

MAN
Yeah?

SAM
Hello sir, I am with the phone company?

MAN
We didn't call the phone company.

SAM
Oh no sir, we're calling you. We've had a lot of complaints from the neighbourhood lately.

MAN
Complaints?

SAM
Yes sir. Dropped calls, static, maybe even strange voices on the other end of the line?

A teenage girls steps into the hallway while SAM is speaking, looking startled.

MAN
No, we haven't had any of that here.

SAM
Nothing?

MAN
No.

SAM
Okay. Great, just thought we'd check. Thanks.

MAN
No problem. (to his son) Come on, Simon.

As they turn to close the door SAM sees the girl staring at him, looking scared. She turns away as the door closes. SAM stares after her.

SAM returns to his car. As he opens the door the girl appears.

LANIE
No way you work for the phone company.

SAM
Sure I do.

LANIE
Since when does a phone guy drive a rental or wear a cheap suit?

SAM
(Huffing a laugh) Yeah, well. Maybe we're both keeping secrets.

LANIE
Why did you ask my Dad if he's hearing strange voices on the phone?

SAM
Why, did you hear something?

LANIE
No.

SAM
My mistake, I thought maybe you did.

LANIE
Well I didn't, okay?

SAM
(Smiling) Okay. Sorry to bother you.

LANIE looks uncomfortable but doesn't move. SAM looks down at his keys.

SAM
Because you know...if you did...then I would have told you that I've been right where you're standing right now. Hearing things, even seeing things that can't be explained. Maybe I would have been able to help out a little bit. Anyway...

LANIE
Hey wait. Maybe....maybe I've been talking on the phone...with my Mom.

SAM
Well that's not so strange.

LANIE
She's dead. Like three years now.

SAM
How often does she call you?

LANIE
A few times. It started a week ago. I thought I was like, crazy or something.

SAM
Well I can tell you one thing for sure, and you're going to have to go with me on this, okay? You're not crazy.

.....................

INTERIOR. SAM'S RENTAL CAR.

SAM
(answering phone) Yeah.

DEAN
(Walking down a busy street) Dude, stiffs have been calling people all over town.

SAM
Yeah, tell me about it.

DEAN
I just talked to an 84 year old grandmother who's having phone sex with her husband, who died in Korea!

SAM
Eww.

DEAN
It redefined my understanding of the word 'Necrophilia'.

A young woman walking past DEAN overhears and gasps, giving him a dirty look as she passes. He pauses, grimacing, then turns to check her out as she continues walking.

SAM
So what the hell's going on here, Dean?

DEAN
(Reaching the Impala) Beats me, but we'd better find out soon. This place is turning into spook central.

SAM
Yeah. All right, I'll call you later.

DEAN
(Opening the door) Yeah.

They hang up. DEAN'S phone immediately rings again.

DEAN
Yeah, what?

There is nothing but static.

DEAN
Sam?

JOHN
Dean?

DEAN freezes, looking shocked.

JOHN
Dean, is that you?

DEAN
Dad?

END ACT ONE


ACT TWO
INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

SAM sits at the table, DEAN paces.

SAM
Dad? You really think it was Dad?

DEAN
I don't know, maybe.

SAM
Well what did he sound like?

DEAN
Like Oprah! Like Dad, he sounded like Dad, what do you think?

SAM
What did he say?

DEAN
My name.

SAM
That's it?

DEAN
Call dropped out.

SAM
Why would he even call in the first place, Dean?

DEAN
I don't know, man. Why are ghosts calling anybody in this town? But I mean, other people are hearing from their loved ones, why can't we? It's at least a possibility, right?

SAM
Yeah, I guess?

DEAN
Okay, so what if....what if it really is Dad? What happens if he calls back?

SAM
What do you mean?

DEAN
What do I say?

SAM
Hello.

DEAN
Hello?

SAM shrugs.

DEAN
That's what you come back with. Hello?

SAM
Uhh...

DEAN
(Grabbing his jacket and heading for the door) Hello!

DEAN walks out. SAM looks after him, concerned. He shakes his head.

...................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

Later. SAM sits on the couch with the laptop in front of him. DEAN returns.

DEAN
Find anything?

SAM
After three hours I have found no reason why anything supernatural would be going on here.

DEAN
Well, you know, you think a Stanford education and a high school hook up rate of zero point zero would produce better results than that.

SAM
Hilarious.

DEAN
Sammy, you're just looking in the wrong places, pal.

SAM
And what are the right places, Dean?

DEAN
(Reaching into his jacket pocket) Motel pamphlet rack.

DEAN drops some literature on the coffee table.

DEAN
Milan, Ohio. Birthplace of Thomas Edison.

SAM
(Flicking through the papers) Yeah, right. So what?

DEAN
Keep reading.

SAM scoffs slightly and keeps looking. He sighs, but after a few moments his eyebrows go up and he looks at DEAN.

SAM
You're kidding.

DEAN raises his eyebrows back, smiling.

.....................

INTERIOR. MUSEUM.

A young female guide shepherds a tour.

GUIDE
And we're walking. And, here we have one of the museum's most unique and treasured possessions. Thomas Edison's spirit phone. Did you know that Mr Edison, as well as being one of America's most beloved inventors, was also a devout occultist? Ooh!

DEAN
(Whispering) What's with the quote-y fingers?

GUIDE
He spent years working on this, his final invention, which he was convinced could be used to communicate with the dead. Pretty spooky, huh?

The guide checks her watch, twirls her fingers in the air and begins leading the group into the next room.

GUIDE
And we're walking. We are walking. We're walking. And we're not touching that. And we're walking. And stop.

SAM quickly gets out his EMF and holds it over the spirit phone.

DEAN
Anything?

SAM
Nothing.

DEAN
What do you think?

SAM
Honestly? It kinda looks like an old pile of junk to me.

DEAN
It's not even plugged in.

SAM
Maybe it didn't work like that.

DEAN
Okay. Maybe it's like a radio tower, broadcasting the dead all over town.

SAM
Could be.

DEAN
You know, this caller I.D. is 100 years old, right? Right around the time this thing was built.

SAM
Yeah, but why would it all of a sudden start working now?

DEAN
I don't know. But as long as the mouldy are calling the freshers around here it's the best reason we've got.

SAM
Yeah, maybe.

DEAN
So maybe it really is Dad.

............................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.

SAM sleeps. DEAN sits at the table, a large take away coffee cup in his hand, his phone beside him. He stares into space. The phone rings, the display showing 'SHA33'. DEAN grabs it quickly and heads into the bathroom.

DEAN
(Whispering) Dad?

JOHN
Dean.

DEAN
Is it really you?

JOHN
It's me.

DEAN
How can I be sure?

JOHN
You can't. Dean, how could you do it?

DEAN
What?

JOHN
Sell your soul.

DEAN
(Concerned) I was looking after Sam, like you told me to.

JOHN
I never wanted this. Never. You're my boy, I love you. I can't watch you to go to hell, Dean.

DEAN
I'm sorry. I don't know how to stop it.

JOHN
’Cause if you break the deal Sam dies, right?

DEAN
What?

JOHN
Well I know a way out. For both of you.

DEAN
How?

JOHN
The demon who holds your contract. He's here. Now.

........................................

INTERIOR. LANIE'S BEDROOM.

LANIE is on her computer.

LANIE
(Writes) Okay. See you tomorrow.

The computer beeps a new message.

SHA33
Lanie? Is that you?

LANIE
(Typing) Mom?

SHA33
I asked you a question last night. Have you thought about it?

LANIE
I don't know what you want.

SHA33
Of course you do. I want to see you.

LANIE
I went to see you. At the cemetery.

SHA33
That's not what I mean.

LANIE
But I'm scared.

SHA33
Don't be sacred. I'm right here with you.

The screen suddenly blacks out. LANIE can see her reflection in it. She is terrified. Behind her, her mother approaches and lays a hand on her shoulder. LANIE swings around but there's no one there. She jumps up, turns off the screen and backs away, gasping and crying.

The screen turns itself back on. LANIE gasps. "Come to me." is typed over and over across the whole screen. LANIE approaches the computer, crying.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

DEAN is typing furiously on the laptop. SAM enters.

DEAN
What's up?

SAM
That girl Lanie, her Mom's ghost spooked her out pretty bad last night.

DEAN
That sucks.

SAM
Yeah it does. What are you doing?

DEAN
I think Dad's right. I think the demon is here. Check it out.

DEAN hands SAM some papers and goes to his bag.

SAM
What is this, weather reports?

DEAN
Omens. Demonic omens. Electrical storms everywhere we've been for the past two weeks.

SAM
Ahh...I don't remember any lightning storms.

DEAN
Well, I don't remember you studying meteorology as a kid either. But I'm telling you, that bastard's been tailing me...wearing some poor dude's meat.

SAM
And it's following you because...

DEAN
I guess I'm big game, you know. My ass is too sweet to let outta sight.

SAM
Okay. Sure.

DEAN
(Snatching the papers back) Don't get too excited, Sammy. Might pull something.

SAM
Dean, look, I wanna believe this man, I really do...

DEAN
Then believe it! if we get this sucker, it's Miller Time.

SAM
Yeah, that's another thing. Dad rattles off an exorcism that can kill a demon? I mean not just send it back to hell, but kill it?

DEAN
I've checked it out. This is heavy duty Dark Ages. Fifteenth century.

SAM
(Quietly) Yeah, I've checked on it too Dean. And so did Bobby.

DEAN
Okay, and?

SAM
Look. It definitely is an exorcism, okay, there's just no evidence it can kill a demon.

DEAN
No evidence it can't.

SAM
Come on man...

DEAN
Hey, as far as I'm aware the only one of us who has actually been to hell is Dad. And maybe he picked up a couple of tricks down there, like which exorcisms work.

SAM
Maybe it does. I hope it does too, but we gotta be sure.

DEAN
Why aren't we sure?

SAM
’Cause I don't know what's going on around here Dean! I mean, some guy blows his brains out, a little girl is scared out of her wits.

DEAN
Wow, a couple of civvies are freaked out by some ghosts. News flash Sam, people are supposed to be freaked out by ghosts!

They stare at each other for a long moment. SAM sighs and DEAN drops his head in frustration.

SAM
Dad tell you where to find the demon?

DEAN
(Shouting) I'm waiting on the call!

SAM
(Sighing again) I told Lanie I'd stop by.

DEAN
(Sarcastic) Oh, good yeah. No you go hang out with jail bait. Just, uh, watch out for Chris Hansen. Meanwhile I'll be here getting ready to, you know, save my life.

SAM keeps moving toward the door.

DEAN
(Shouting) You're unbelievable, you know that? I mean for months we've been trying to break this demon deal. Now Dad's about to give us the freaking address and you can't accept it? The man is dead and you're still butting heads with the guy!

SAM
That is not what this is about.

DEAN
(Shouting) So what is it!

SAM
(Shouting back) The fact is we've got no hard proof here, Dean. After everything, you're still just going on blind faith!

DEAN
Yeah, well maybe! You know, maybe that's all I got, okay?

They stare at each other again. DEAN looks down.

SAM
Please. Just please don't go anywhere until I get back. Okay, Dean? Please.

DEAN remains silent. SAM shakes his head and turns for the door. DEAN watches him go and continues staring at the door for a long moment. He shakes his head and moves to sit heavily at the table.

..............................

INTERIOR. LANIE'S HOUSE.

SAM
Have you told your father about any of this?

LANIE
And bother him at work? No. He wouldn't believe me anyway, he'd just chuck me into therapy.

SAM
So what did your mother say?

LANIE
She wanted to see me. So at first I thought I was supposed to go to the cemetery.

SAM
Did you?

LANIE
(Nodding) Nothing happened. But then she started asking me to do other things.

SAM
What sort of things?

LANIE
Bad things.

............................

INTERIOR. SIMON's ROOM.

SIMON sits playing at his table. The phone rings. SIMON looks over at his toy telephone sitting on the floor then walks over to it. The display reads SHA33.

SIMON
Hello? Simon Greenfield speaking. Hi Mommy. Yeah, I wanna see you. Where are you?

............................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

DEAN sits at the table staring at nothing. His phone ring and he snatches it up.

DEAN
Dad?

JOHN
Yeah.

DEAN
Where's the demon?

............................

INTERIOR. LANIE'S ROOM.

SAM
Lanie please. Tell me what happened, it's very important.

LANIE
Mom told me to go to Dad's medicine cabinet.

SAM
And?

LANIE
She wanted me to take his sleeping pills, take all of his sleeping pills.

SAM
She wanted you to kill yourself?

LANIE
(Nods, crying) Why would my Mom want me to do that?

SAM
I don't know.

LANIE
I mean, just so I could come to her?

SAM
What'd you say?

LANIE
She wanted me to come to her.

SAM
No, how'd she say it?

LANIE
"Come to me." Like a million times.

SAM
Lanie. That's not your mother.

..............................

EXTERIOR. SUBURBAN STREET.

DEAN pulls up and gets out. He grabs his weapon's bag from the trunk, looks around and moves toward a house.

...........................

INTERIOR. HALLWAY, LANIE'S HOUSE.

SAM
Listen to me. Don't answer the phone. Don't use the computer. Don't do anything unless I say to, all right?

SAM starts down the stairs and realizes LANIE'S not following.

SAM
Lanie.

LANIE
(standing in a doorway) Where's Simon?

...........................

INTERIOR. HOUSE.

DEAN enters quietly enters and moves down the hallway, listening. A floorboard creaks on the second floor.

DEAN
Hello?

.............................

EXTERIOR. BUSY STREET.

SIMON walks as if in a trance across the road. Cars horns blare.

............................

INTERIOR. HOUSE.

DEAN drops a rosary into a large bottle of water. Cut to him shaking a paint can and spraying a devil's trap on the floor.

.............................

SIMON keeps walking across the next road. A large truck barrels toward him. In the cab the driver glances away from the road to check his delivery list. He looks back to see SIMON in front of him. The truck horn blares and tires squeal. SIMON seems to awaken and throws his hands up to protect himself. SAM rushes the road, grabs SIMON and dives for the verge. They lay panting as the truck roars past.

..........................

INTERIOR. SAM'S RENTAL CAR.

SAM
(On phone) Dean, it's not Dad.

DEAN
Then what is it?

SAM
A crocotta.

DEAN
Is that a sandwich?

SAM
Some kind of scavenger. Mimics loved ones, whispers 'Come to me', then lures you into the dark and swallows your soul.

DEAN
A crocotta, right, damn that makes sense.

SAM
Dean, look, I'm sorry man, I know...

DEAN
Hey, don't these things live in filth?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Sam, the flies at the phone company.

..........................

EXTERIOR. NIGHT. CARPARK OF PHONE COMPANY.

SAM creeps along an alley and peaks in a window at STEWIE, sitting at his console. He is distracted by a banging noise. When he looks back STEWIE is leaving the room. SAM runs back up the alley.

Cut to STEWIE leaving the building. SAM hides behind a van, holding his phone to his ear.

DEAN'S VOICEMAIL.
This is Herman Munster. Leave a message.

SAM
Dean, I'm in the parking lot. He's here. Hurry.

STEWIE unlocks his car. SAM rushes him, pushing him into the car and holding a metal spike to the back of his neck.

STEWIE
(Grunting) What the hell!

SAM
I know what you are.

STEWIE
Wait, mister.

SAM
And I know how to kill you.

STEWIE
Please. Okay, wait, wait. If we're overcharging you for the call waiting or something I...I can fix that. I am your friend!

SAM looks confused.

STEWIE
Please. Please just don't kill me!

The manager from earlier sneaks up behind SAM.

STEWIE
Don't kill me, please!

The manager hits SAM over the head with a bat. SAM slumps to the ground.

STEWIE turns around, sees the manager, grins and starts bouncing up and down.

STEWIE
Yeah! That's what happens when you mess with the phone company, dillweed!

STEWIE
(To his manager) Thank you, Clark!

CLARK
(Lifting the bat again) Forget about it.

STEWIE
Clark?

CLARK smashes STEWIE with the bat.

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INTERIOR. PHONE COMPANY BASEMENT.

STEWIE and SAM are tied to chairs.

STEWIE
(Snivelling) I'm sorry, Clark. I'm sorry for whatever I did to you. I'm sorry...please...

SAM
(Coming to) Wait! Don't do it.

CLARK
(To Sam) You're awake.

CLARK leans over STEWIE and places the tip of a knife against his thigh.

STEWIE
You're not a killer Clark, no! There's a good man inside of you, I know it.

CLARK
What do you think, Sammy, am I a good man?

SAM
Just let him go.

CLARK
I would. I really would. If only I'd had more than a salad for lunch. You see, I'm starving.

He lifts the knife high above his head and plunges it into STEWIE'S chest.

SAM
No!

CLARK moves in front of STEWIE's body. His mouth opens, revealing a blood red interior and razor sharp spikes. He crouches slightly, holds STEWIE by both shoulders and unhinges his jaw, his mouth becoming impossibly wide. Placing his mouth close to STEWIE's face he sucks in his energy. SAM shudders and looks away.

CLARK stands, wiping his mouth.

SAM
My last call with Dean. That was you. You led me here.

CLARK
Some calls I make, some calls I take, but you have to admit, I had you fooled for a while. All that Edison phone crap.

CLARK laughs and moves over to the telephone exchange cabinet. He places his hands against the glass and leans back in ecstasy.

SAM
What are you doing?

CLARK
I'm killing your brother. Or maybe I'm killing another guy. We'll just have to see how it goes.

.........................

INTERIOR. POLICE LOCKER ROOM.

A man's phone rings just as he finishes changing. He looks at the number, glances over at the other person in the room, and answers.

MAN
(Softly) Hello?

GIRL
(Through static) Hi Daddy.

MAN
Hey baby. I thought you said you weren't gunna call anymore.

GIRL
I know, Daddy.

MAN
You know how sad this makes your old man. How upset I was at your funeral.

GIRL
I had to call, I know who killed me Daddy.

MAN
What?

GIRL
The man who killed me, he's at the house right now.

MAN
(Shocked) What are you saying to me?

GIRL
He's at the house Daddy, he wants to kill you too!

Hanging up the phone, the man's face becomes set in stone.

..............................

INTERIOR. PHONE COMPANY BASEMENT.

CLARK pulls the knife out of STEWIE's chest.

SAM
You know, mimicking Dean's one thing. But my Dad. That's a hell of a trick.

CLARK
Well once I made you two as hunters, it was easy. I found Dean's number, then your number, then your father's numbers. Then emails, voicemails, everything. You see, people think that stuff just gets erased, but it doesn't. You'd be surprised how much of yourself is just floating out there, waiting to be plucked.

SAM
Dean's not going to fall for this. He's not going to kill that guy.

CLARK
Then the guy kills him.

...............................

INTERIOR. SUBURBAN HOUSE.

Car headlights shine across the window into the room where DEAN waits. He silently moves toward the hallway. A car door slams. DEAN removes the lid from the bottle of holy water. He hears a noise toward the back of the house and frowns, moving down the hallway toward the back door. He pauses, then looks from the back to the front door.

The back door slams open and the man appears, raising a rifle and firing. DEAN leaps out of the way, dropping the bottle of holy water. The Man begins reloading. DEAN glances at the holy water it is draining away. He waits to hear the bullet shell being removed and runs for the man, using his forward movement to slam him back into the wall. He hits him a few times, then knees him viciously. Letting him drop, DEAN moves toward the rifle but the man follows, grabbing DEAN and slamming him backwards onto a table. He gets in a few hits before DEAN headbutts him. As the man falls backwards to the ground DEAN kicks him in the stomach. He kicks him four times, pauses, then kicks him once more, even more viciously, grunting as he does so.

..........................

INTERIOR. PHONE COMPANY BASEMENT

CLARK
(Standing over SAM) Technology. Makes life so much easier. Used to be I'd hide in the woods for days, weeks, whispering to people, trying to draw them out into the night. But they had community, they all looked out for each other, I'd be lucky to eat one or two souls a year. Now when I'm hungry, I simply make a phone call. (Sneering) You're all so connected. But you've never been so alone.

CLARK opens his mouth and begins to unhinge his jaw while raising his knife. While he has been speaking SAM has managed to escape his ties, his wrists bloody. He erupts out of the chair and they fall to the ground, CLARK losing the knife. They struggle for it, SAM rising first. CLARK grabs SAM's jacket and swings him around into a metal grate. CLARK picks up the knife, running at SAM.

...........................

INTERIOR. HOUSE.

DEAN and the MAN slam through a glass door. The man is groggy. DEAN quickly reaches for the man's belt. He pulls out a handgun, flicking the cartridge out and tossing it aside. As the man struggles to get to his feet, covered in glass, DEAN pulls back the rug, showing the devil’s trap sprayed onto the floor. He turns away, pulling the exorcism out of his pocket. The MAN, confused, stares at the markings on the floor.

MAN
What is this?

DEAN
Your funeral.

DEAN begins the exorcism in Latin. The man glares at him and slowly moves forward out of the circle.

MAN
You do this to my daughter too?

DEAN
(staring at the devil's trap) How the hell did you get out?

MAN
(Shouting) Did you do this to my daughter too?

DEAN
Wait, this is a mistake.

MAN
You killed her!!

DEAN
No, wait.

The MAN leaps at DEAN.

...........................

SAM and CLARK struggle for the knife, exchanging blows as they move about the room. SAM finally manages to pull the knife away and hits CLARK, forcing him backwards into the wall. A spike, one of many on a corkboard, jams into the back of CLARK's neck, killing him.

........................

The MAN falls on DEAN as he lies on the ground, laying into him.

MAN
She was 9 years old!!

DEAN
Stop! I didn't! You gotta believe me!

The man keeps hitting him.

DEAN manages to twist around and grab the rifle, smacking the man in the forehead with the butt. He falls backwards. DEAN rises, standing over him.

MAN
(Crying) Why did you kill her?

DEAN
I'm sorry. I didn't kill your daughter.

MAN
Then what are you doing here?

DEAN
(Anguished) I don't know.

................................

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

DEAN holds a facecloth to his cut eye, groaning. SAM enters the room and comes to the door of the bathroom.

DEAN
I see they improved your face.

SAM
(Sniggering) Right back at ya.

DEAN moves past SAM into the main room. They sit on a bed each.

DEAN
So, crocotta, huh?

SAM
Yep.

DEAN
That would explain the flies.

SAM
Yeah it would. Hey, um...look I'm sorry it wasn't Dad.

DEAN
(Huffs) Nah, I gave you a hell of a time on this one.

SAM
Ahh.

DEAN
You were right.

SAM
Forget about it.

DEAN
I can't. I wanted to believe so badly that there was a way outta this. I mean I'm staring down the barrel at this thing. You know, Hell. For real, forever, and I just...

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
(Tearing up) I'm scared, Sam. I'm really scared.

SAM
(Also tearing up) I know.

DEAN
I guess I was willing to believe anything. You know, the last act of a desperate man.

SAM
There's nothing wrong with having hope, Dean.

DEAN
Hope doesn't get you jack squat. I can't expect Dad to show up with some miracle at the last minute. I can't expect anybody to, you know. I mean the only person that can get me out of this thing is me.

SAM
(Earnestly) And me.

DEAN
And me?

SAM
What?

DEAN
Deep revelation, having a real moment here, that's what you come back with? And me?

SAM
(Raising his eyebrows) Uh...do you want a poem?

DEAN
The moment's gone.

SAM smiles slightly. DEAN flicks the TV on, reaches between the beds, grabs two bottles of beer and holds one out to SAM without looking at him. SAM takes one, they crack them open and drink in unison, while staring at the TV.
