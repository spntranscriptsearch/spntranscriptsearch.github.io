TEASER

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
A young girl is sitting in a hospital bed in a contemplative way like she's listening some distant whispering.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Anna? Do you know where you are? You're at the Connor Beverly Behavioral Medicine Center. [ ANNA looks at her hospital's wristband ] Do you know why you're here? [ ANNA shrugs ] Do you remember what you did? [ ANNA nods ] You were hysterical. It took four people to restrain you.

ANNA
I was trying to warn them.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Warn who?

ANNA
Everyone. Forget it. It was stupid.

PSYCHOLOGIST
What were you trying to warn them about?

ANNA
Look... I get it. You think I'm nuts. If I were you, I'd think I was nuts. But it's all true.

PSYCHOLOGIST
It's okay. You can tell me. I'm here to listen.

ANNA
The end... is coming. The apocalypse.

PSYCHOLOGIST
The apocalypse. Like in the Bible?

ANNA
Kind of. I mean, same bottom line. This demon, Lilith, is trying to break the 66 seals to free Lucifer from Hell. Lucifer... Will bring the apocalypse. So... Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

ANNA turns her head and listens to a distant whispering.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Anna?

ANNA
Sorry.

PSYCHOLOGIST
What were you doing?

ANNA
Nothing. Just listening.

PSYCHOLOGIST
So, you were saying that there are, uh, 66 of these seals in the world?

ANNA
No. No. There are about 600 possible seals, and Lilith only has to break 66 of them, and no one knows which 66 she's gonna break.

PSYCHOLOGIST
I see.

ANNA
That's why it's nearly impossible to stop her. And that's why the angels are losing. That's why we're all gonna die.

An hospital attendant enters Anna's room.

ATTENDANT
Time for your meds, Anna. Anna?

ANNA turns around and looks horrified when she notices the attendant.

ATTENDANT
What's the matter, sweetie?

ANNA
Your face -- what happened to your face?

ATTENDANT
I know.

The ATTENDANT's eyes turn black, revealing he's possessed by a demon.

ATTENDANT
I'm downright kissable. Shh.

ANNA uses her mind to push a chest of drawers against the ATTENDANT and knock him unconscious.


ACT ONE

INT. BAR
SAM appears to be drunk and is playing pool with a man from the bar.

SAM
Brian, come on, man, just one more. Just -- just give me a chance to win it back.

BRIAN
It's your cash.

DEAN
Excuse me. My brother's a little sauced to be making bets.

BRIAN
He insisted.

DEAN
Yeah, but you've already taken, what, two bills off him? I'm just saying.

SAM
Hey, shut up, Dean. I'm fine.

DEAN
No, you're not fine. You're drunk!

SAM
Let's make it five hundred.

DEAN
Five hundred?

BRIAN
Sure.

SAM puts the money down on the pool table.

BRIAN
Five hundred. Your break.

While BRIAN is looking down, SAM raises his eyebrows at DEAN. For a second there's no trace of drunkenness. DEAN raises his eyebrows at SAM. SAM breaks, sinking several balls, then sees RUBY across the bar.

SAM
Keep the money.

SAM puts his cue down on the pool table and walks towards RUBY.

DEAN
Keep the money? What --

After a moment, DEAN follows SAM.
SAM
Hey.

DEAN
Well, you got a lot of nerve showing up anywhere near me.

RUBY
I just have some info, and then I'm gone.

SAM
What is it?

RUBY
I'm hearing a few whispers.

DEAN
Ooh, great, demon whisperers -- that's reliable.

RUBY
Girl named Anna Milton escaped from a locked ward yesterday. The demons seem pretty keen on finding her. Apparently, some real heavy hitters turned out for the Easter-egg hunt.

SAM
Why? Who is she?

RUBY
No idea.

RUBY
But I'm thinking that she's important, 'cause the order is to capture her alive. I just figured that whatever the deal is, you might want to find this girl before the demons do.

SAM
Look, maybe we should check it out.

DEAN
Actually, we're working a case, but thanks.

RUBY
What case?

DEAN
Uh, we've got leads, big leads.

RUBY
Sounds dangerous.

DEAN
Yeah, well, it sure ain't goose-chasing after some chick who, for all we know, doesn't even exist, just because you say she's important.

RUBY
I'm just delivering the news. You can do whatever you want with it. Far as I'm concerned, I told you, I'm done.

SAM
Wait, wait, wait. This hospital Anna escaped from -- it got a name?

EXT. IMPALA â€“ NIGHT
DEAN is driving and SAM is speaking on the phone.

SAM
Can I get a copy of the missing persons report? Great. Okay. Thanks.

SAM hangs up.

SAM
Well, Anna Milton's definitely real.

DEAN
Don't mean the case is real. And this hospital's a three-day drive.

SAM
We've driven further for less, Dean. [ DEAN shakes his head ] You got something to say, say it.

DEAN
Oh, I'm saying it -- this sucks.

SAM
You're not pissed we're going after the girl. You're pissed Ruby threw us the tip.

DEAN
Right. 'Cause as far as you're concerned, the hell-bitch is practically family. Yeah, boy, something major must've happened while I downstairs, 'cause I come back, and -- and you're BFF with a demon?

SAM
I told you, Dean, she helped me go after Lilith.

DEAN
Well, thanks for the thumbnail -- real vivid. You want to fill in a little detail?

SAM
Sure, Dean, let's trade stories. You first. How was Hell? Don't spare the details.

Six Months Earlier

EXT. CROSSROAD - NIGHT
SAM is burying a box in a crossroad to summon a CROSSROAD DEMON. He is drunk.

SAM
Come on! Where the hell are you?

CROSSROAD DEMON
I was wondering whether to come or not. I mean, you shot one of my co-workers. Don't take this the wrong way, Sam, but you don't look so hot, buddy. I guess burying your brother didn't agree with you.

SAM
Well?

CROSSROAD DEMON
Well, let's see that special little knife of yours first.

SAM takes out the knife and slams it down on an outdoor table.

SAM
No devil's traps, either. I'm not here to play games.

CROSSROAD DEMON
Well, let me guess. You want to make a deal. And 'round and 'round the Winchesters go. I'm sorry, Sam. That's not gonna happen.

SAM stabs the knife into the CROSSROAD DEMON's hand.

SAM
I don't want ten years. I don't want one year. I don't want candy! I want to trade places with Dean.

CROSSROAD DEMON
No.

SAM
Just take me! It's a fair trade!

CROSSROAD DEMON
No!

SAM
Why not? Lilith wants me dead. Just let Dean go, and she can have me.

CROSSROAD DEMON
Don't you understand, Sam? It's not about your soul. Dean's in Hell, right where we want him. We've got everything exactly the way we want it. You want to kill me? Go ahead. I've made peace with my lord.

EXT. IMPALA - NIGHT
Back to present

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

PSYCHOLOGIST
[ out of sign ] Of course I want to help however I can.

SAM
Now, the orderly has no recollection of Anna's escape?

PSYCHOLOGIST
Apparently, she knocked him unconscious. The blow caused some amnesia. He doesn't even remember coming into her room.

DEAN
That's a hell of a right hook to knock out a guy that's got 80 pounds on her.

PSYCHOLOGIST
We think she may have planned this, waited behind the door.

SAM
Right. Uh, you mentioned Anna's illness was recent.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Two months ago, she was happy, well-adjusted, journalism major, lots of friends -- Bright future.

DEAN
So, what happened -- she just... flipped?

PSYCHOLOGIST
Well, that's the tragedy of schizophrenia. Within weeks, Anna was overtaken by delusions.

SAM
What kind of delusions?

PSYCHOLOGIST
She thought demons were everywhere. [ Gives a sketch book to SAM ]

DEAN
Interesting.

PSYCHOLOGIST
It's not uncommon for our patients to believe that monsters are real.

DEAN
Well, that -- that's just batty.

SAM turns the pages and they see some meaningful sketches and the text 'Raising of the Witnesses' and in the next page 'Samhain the next seal is broken'.

DEAN
That's Revelations.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Since when does the Book of Revelations have jack-o'-lanterns?

DEAN
It's a, uh, it's a little-known translation.

PSYCHOLOGIST
Well, Anna's father was a church deacon. When she became ill, her paranoia took on religious overtones. She was convinced the devil was about to rise up and end the world. I hope you find her. It's dangerous for her to be out there alone right now.

EXT. MILTON HOME - DAY
DEAN knocks on the front door.

DEAN
Maybe they're not home.

SAM
Both cars in the driveway.

DEAN tries the door. It's unlocked and they enter the house.

INT. MILTON HOME - DAY

DEAN
Mr. And Mrs. Milton?

SAM
We're from the sheriff's department. We just wanted to ask you a couple of questions.

There are two dead bodies lying in the floor. Their throats have been cut.


ACT TWO
INT. MILTON HOME - DAY
SAM checks some powder on the floor near the dead bodies.

SAM
Sulfur. The demons beat us here. Whatever the deal is with this Anna girl --

DEAN
Yeah, they want her. They're not screwing around. All right, so, I'm "Girl, Interrupted," [ DEAN picks up some addressed envelopes ] and I know the score of the apocalypse, just busted out of the nut-box... Possibly using superpowers, by the way. Where do I go?

SAM looks at family photographs and picks one up.

SAM
Hey, you got those sketches from Anna's notebook?

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
Let me see 'em. Check this out. [ SAM picks out a drawing of a stained-glass window ]

DEAN
She was drawing the window of her church.

SAM
Over and over. If you were religious, scared, and had demons on your ass, where would you go to feel safe?

EXT. CHURCH - DAY
The Impala is parked in front of the church. Through a window, two figures can be seen going upstairs.

INT. CHURCH'S ATTIC - DAY
SAM and DEAN enter the attic with their guns drawn.

SAM
Dean. [ SAM points with his gun towards a person hiding ] Anna? [ They put away their guns ] We're not gonna hurt you. We're here to help. My name is Sam. This is my brother, Dean.

ANNA
Sam? Not Sam Winchester?

SAM
Uh, yeah.

ANNA
And you're Dean. The Dean?

DEAN
Well, yeah. The Dean, I guess.

ANNA
It's really you. Oh, my god. The angels talk about you. You were in Hell, but Castiel pulled you out, and some of them think you can help save us. And some of them don't like you at all. [looking at Sam] They talk about you all the time lately. I feel like I know you.

DEAN
So, you talk to angels?

ANNA
Oh, no. No, no way. Um, they probably don't even know I exist. I just kind of... overhear them.

SAM
You overhear them?

ANNA
Yeah, they talk, and sometimes I just... hear them in my head.

DEAN
Like... right now?

ANNA
Not right this second, but a lot. And I can't shut them out, there are so many of them.

DEAN
So, they lock you up with a case of the crazies when really you were just... tuning in to angel radio?

ANNA
Yes. Thank you.

SAM
Anna, when did the voices start? Do you remember?

ANNA
I can tell you exactly -- September 18th.

DEAN
The day I got out of Hell.

ANNA
First words I heard, clear as a bell -- "Dean Winchester is saved."

DEAN
What do you think?

SAM
It's above my pay grade, man.

DEAN
Well, at least now we know why the demons want you so bad. They get a hold of you, they can hear everything the other side's cooking. You're 1-900-angel.

ANNA
Hey, um, do you know -- are my parents okay? I -- I didn't go home. I was afraid.

RUBY enters into the attic in a rush.

RUBY
You got the girl. Good, let's go.

ANNA
Her face!

SAM
It's okay. She's here to help.

DEAN
Yeah, don't be so sure.

RUBY
We have to hurry.

DEAN
Why?

RUBY
Because a demon's coming -- big-timer. We can fight later, Dean.

DEAN
Well, that's pretty convenient -- showing up right when we find the girl with some bigwig on your tail?

RUBY
I didn't bring him here. You did.

DEAN
What?

RUBY
He followed you from the girl's house. We got to go now.

SAM
Dean.

SAM points to a statue that's bleeding from the eyes.

RUBY
It's too late. He's here.

SAM takes ANNA by the arm and hides her in a closet.

SAM
Okay. Stay in there. Don't move.

ANNA
Okay.

SAM takes out a flask of holy water.

RUBY
No, Sam, you got to pull him right away.

DEAN
Whoa, hold on a sec.

RUBY
Now's not the time to bellyache about Sam going darkside. He does his thing, he exorcises that demon, or we die.

SAM puts the flask away again. The demon enters and SAM tries to exorcise him, but it doesn't work.

ALASTAIR
That tickles. You don't have the juice to take me on, Sam.

ALASTAIR throws SAM downstairs. DEAN attacks him with RUBY's knife, but ALASTAIR wins their fight.

ALASTAIR
Hello again, Dean.

ANNA screams as RUBY pulls her from the closet.

ALASTAIR
Come on, Dean. Don't you recognize me? Oh, I forgot -- I'm wearing a pediatrician. But we were so close... in Hell.

DEAN
Alastair.

SAM stabs ALASTAIR with RUBY's knife but barely missed his heart and essentially only hitshis shoulder.

ALASTAIR
You're gonna have to try a whole lot harder than that, son.

SAM grabs DEAN and they look at a large stained-glass window. As ALASTAIR pulls out the knife, SAM and DEAN jump through the window.

INT. MOTEL ROOM
SAM is sewing a cut in his left arm while DEAN is in the bathroom.

DEAN
Are you almost done?

SAM
I'm going as fast as I can.

DEAN
Good, 'cause you know I got a dislocated shoulder over here.

DEAN picks up a whiskey bottle and drinks from it.

SAM
Yeah. I'll pop it back when I'm finished.

SAM
Gimme that.

SAM gestures for the bottle and pours whiskey over his wound.

DEAN
So, you lost the magic knife, huh?

SAM
Yeah, saving your ass. Who the hell was that demon?

DEAN
No one good. We got to find Anna.

SAM
Ruby's got her. I'm sure she's okay. All right. Come on. On three. One...

SAM forces DEAN's shoulder back into place.

DEAN
You sure about Ruby? 'Cause I think it's just as likely she used us to find radio girl and then brought that demon in to kill us.

SAM
No, she took Anna to keep her safe.

DEAN
Yeah. Well, why hasn't she called to tell us where she is?

SAM
Because that demon is probably watching us right now, waiting to follow us right back to Anna again. That's why he let us go.

DEAN
You call this letting us go?

SAM
Yeah, I do. Look, killing us would've been no problem to that thing. That's why, for now, we just got to lay low and wait for Ruby to contact us.

DEAN
How's she gonna do that? [ pause ] Why do you trust her so much?

SAM
I told you.

DEAN
You got to do better than that. Hey, and I'm not trying to pick a fight here. I mean, I really want to understand. But I need to know more. I mean, I deserve to know more.

SAM
Because... she saved my life.

Six Months Earlier

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
SAM is drunk, and after he enters the room a man and a women attack him. The woman takes RUBY's knife.

WOMAN
Thanks for keeping this warm for me, Sam.

SAM
Ruby.

RUBY
It's nice to be back. Where I was, even for Hell, it was nasty. I guess I really pissed Lilith off. Imagine my relief when she gave me one last chance to take it topside. And all I had to do was find you and kill you.

SAM
Fine. Go ahead! Do it.

RUBY stabs the other demon instead of SAM.

RUBY
Grab your keys. We got to go. Now!


ACT THREE
Six Months Earlier

INT. IMPALA - NIGHT

RUBY
You know what sounds good? French fries. I'm starving. I just escaped Hell. I deserve a treat. You know, a "thank you" would be nice.

SAM
Who asked for your help?

RUBY
You have no idea what I've been through. When Lilith gets pissed, she gets creative. You want to hear about the corners of Hell I've seen, Sam?

SAM
No, I don't.

RUBY
And the things I had to do to convince her I was sorry? That I could be trusted?

SAM
Well, this'll definitely get you a fat Christmas bonus.

RUBY
Very funny. I'm a fugitive... For you, Sam. I took all of this risk to get back to you, so, yeah, I deserve a damn "thank you."

SAM
Who asked you to save me?

RUBY
I'm just trying to help.

SAM
Can you help me save Dean?

RUBY
No. Nothing I know of is powerful enough to do that.

SAM stops the car by the roadside.

SAM
Then I have no use for you.

RUBY
What?

SAM
Get out.

RUBY
Sam

SAM
Whose body are you riding, Ruby?

RUBY
What do you care? You've never asked me that before.

SAM
I'm asking now.

RUBY
Some secretary.

SAM
Let her go.

RUBY
Sam...

SAM
Or I send you right back to Hell.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
A woman lies in coma on an hospital bed with the name "Doe, Jane" on it.

DOCTOR
All right, pull it.

The machine begins to beep as the woman dies, but she sits up as she is possessed.

RUBY
Who do I have to kill to get some French fries around here?

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
SAM is cleaning a gun. Someone knocks on the door. SAM grabs a shotgun and opens the door, revealing RUBY possessing the coma girl. She holds up a piece of paper.

RUBY
Proof. This body is 100% socially conscious. I recycle. Al Gore would be proud.

SAM
You grabbed a coma patient?

RUBY
You didn't want me to take a body with someone in it, and I made sure that the spirit was gone. Apartment was empty. You happy?

SAM
Why are you here?

RUBY
I can't bring Dean back. But I can get you something else that you want.

SAM
And, uh... what's that?

RUBY
Lilith.

SAM
You want me to use my psychic whatever.

RUBY
Look, I know that it spooks you --

SAM
Skip the speech. I'm ready. Let's go.

RUBY
Slow down there, cowboy.

SAM
Just tell me what I have to do.

RUBY
Look, Lilith is one scary bitch. When I was in the Pit, there was talk. She's cooking up something big -- apocalyptic big.

SAM
So let's kill her.

RUBY
You want to go in there and half-ass it like before? We have the time to get it right. Let's get it right.

SAM
Okay. What do you want from me?

RUBY
Well, a little patience... and sobriety. Promise me that... and I will teach you everything I know.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
We are back to the present.

DEAN
So? What'd she teach you?

SAM
Well, the first thing I learned... I'm a crappy student.

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
SAM is trying to exorcise a demon tied to a chair in a devil's trap, but can't. Some black smoke comes out of the demon's mouth, but then it goes back in. SAM holds his head in pain. As the demon begins to laugh, RUBY kills him with her knife.

RUBY
Not funny.

RUBY
Just give it time, Sam. It'll get better.

SAM
What? I need more practice?

RUBY
I'm not talking about pulling demons. I know losing Dean was --

SAM
Hey! I don't want to talk about it. You know what? Where do you get off slapping me with that greeting-card, time-heals crap? What the hell do you know?

RUBY
I used to be human. And I still remember what it feels like to lose someone. I'm sorry.

RUBY puts a hand on SAM's shoulder.

SAM
Uhn-huh. Don't. I can't.

RUBY
Sam, you're not alone.

RUBY kisses SAM. He stands up and walks away from her.

SAM
What are you doing?

RUBY
Sam, it's okay!

SAM
No, that is anything but okay!

RUBY
What's wrong?

SAM
What's wrong? Where do I start?

RUBY
Is it because of the body? Because I told you -- it's all me inside of here. There is no one else. And it's nice inside this body, Sam. Soft and warm.

SAM
What are you doing?

RUBY
Isn't it 'cause you're really scared to go there with a demon? Because it's wrong and it's bad and we shouldn't?

RUBY and SAM begin to have sex.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
We are back to the present.

DEAN
Sam?

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
Too much information.

SAM
Hey, I told you I was coming clean.

DEAN
Yeah, but now I feel dirty. Okay, well, uh, brain-stabbing imagery aside... So far, all you've told me about is a manipulative bitch who, uh, screwed you, played mind games with you, and did everything in the book to get you to go bad.

SAM
Yeah, well, there's more to the story.

DEAN
Just... skip the nudity, please.

SAM
Pretty soon after... that, um... I put together some signs... Omens.

DEAN
Saying what?

SAM
Lilith was in town. And I wanted to strike her first.

Five Months Earlier

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

RUBY
You're not ready yet.

SAM
It's now or never.

RUBY
No, we got to wait until you get it right. You haven't been too successful.

SAM
All right, I'll use this.

RUBY
Stop. You can't just fly in there reckless, Sam. We need you to take the bitch out.

SAM
Oh, I'll take her out all right.

RUBY
You get one shot, and you're it. You're the only one who can do it, Sam. So if she kills you first...

SAM
What?

RUBY
You don't want to survive this.

SAM
Come on.

RUBY
It's a kamikaze attack. You want to die fighting Lilith.

SAM
That's stupid.

RUBY
No, it's the truth, because if you kill her and you survive this, then you have to go on without your brother! This isn't what Dean would've wanted. This isn't what he died for.

RUBY try to stop him, getting in his way in front of the door.

SAM
Get out of my way.

RUBY
No, Sam. This is suicide!

SAM puts RUBY aside with her knife on her throat and walks out through the door.


ACT FOUR
Five Months Earlier

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
SAM sees a little girl in a house, who is sitting in a table full of cakes and candies.

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
SAM sneaks into the house with RUBY's knife ready to kill the Lilith.

GIRL
Please, I want to go home.

Two demons attack SAM from behind and SAM loses the knife.

DEMON
Lilith sends her regrets. She couldn't make it.

RUBY takes the knife from the floor and kills one of the demons.

RUBY
Take the girl and run!

The DEMON beats RUBY and she loses the knife.

DEMON
Ruby, you're in so much trouble. When we get you down in the basement -- the things we're gonna do to you.

SAM comes back and exorcises the DEMON with his mind.

RUBY
Sam.

SAM
I'm okay. Thanks.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
We are back to the present.

SAM
Ruby came back for me. Whatever you have to say, she saved me. More than that, she got through to me. What she said to me... It's what you would've said. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here.

MAID
Housekeeping.

DEAN
Not now!

MAID
Sir, I've got clean towels.

DEAN opens the door and the MAID enters.

DEAN
Couldn't you just leave 'em at the door?

MAID
I'm at this address.

SAM
I'm sorry. What?

MAID
Go now. Go through the bathroom window, don't stop, don't take your car, don't pass go. There are demons in the hallway and in the parking lot.

SAM
Ruby?

MAID
Okay, yes, so I'm possessing this maid for a hot minute. Sue me.

SAM
What about --

MAID
Coma girl? Slowly rotting on the floor back at the cabin with Anna, so I've got to hurry back. See you when you get there. Go!

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

RUBY
Glad you could make it.

SAM
Yeah, thanks.

SAM
Anna, are you okay?

ANNA
Yeah. I think so. Ruby's not like other demons. She saved my life.

DEAN
Yeah, I hear she does that. I guess I... You know.

RUBY
What?

DEAN
I guess I owe you for... Sam. And I just wanted... you know...

RUBY
Don't strain yourself.

DEAN
Okay, then. Is the moment over? [ RUBY nods ] Good, 'cause that was awkward.

ANNA
Hey, Sam, you think it'd be safe to make a quick call, just to tell my parents I'm okay? They must be completely freaked.

SAM
Uh...

ANNA
What?

SAM
Anna, um... Your parents...

ANNA
What about them?

SAM
Look, I'm sorry.

ANNA
No, they're not...

SAM
Anna, I'm sorry.

ANNA
Why is this happening to me?

SAM
I don't know.

ANNA
They're coming.

DEAN
Back room.

SAM takes ANNA to the back room, then comes back.

RUBY
Where's the knife?

DEAN
Uh... about that...

RUBY
You're kidding.

DEAN
Hey, don't look at me.

SAM
Thanks a lot.

RUBY
Great. Just peachy. Impeccable timing, guys, really.

The door rattles violently and bursts open.

ACT FIVE
INT. CABIN - NIGHT
CASTIEL and URIEL enter.

DEAN
Please tell me you're here to help. We've been having demon issues all day.

URIEL
Well, I can see that. You want to explain why you have that stain in the room?

CASTIEL
We're here for Anna.

DEAN
Here for her like... here for her?

URIEL
Stop talking. Give her to us.

SAM
Are you gonna help her?

CASTIEL
No, she has to die.
