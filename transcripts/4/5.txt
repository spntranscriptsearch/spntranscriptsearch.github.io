TEASER
Pan down from the crescent moon. The Impala drives down a road lined with trees and past a sign saying WELCOME TO PENNSYLVANIA. Lightning flashes, for an instant the sign reads WELCOME TO TRANSYLVANIA.


DEAN

The radio around here sucks.


DEAN turns off the radio.


DEAN

Come on, man. Jobs don't get much sweeter than this, you know? Dead vic with a gnawed-on neck, body drained of blood, and a witness who swears up and down that it was a vampire.


SAM

No, I -- I agree. It's a hell of a case.


DEAN

A little more gusto, please.


SAM

It's just... the world is coming to an end. Things are a little complicated, you know?


DEAN

Yeah, well, we can't save the world, not today anyway. But what we can do is chop off some vamps' heads. Come on, man, it's like the good old days, an honest-to-goodness monster hunt. It's about time the Winchesters got back to tackling a straightforward, black and white case.


ACT ONE
Fade out on the impala. Polka music plays. Pan down over a village where a band is playing in a gazebo. Man takes picture of girl in barmaid costume. Pan to sign reading OKTOBERFEST 2008. SAM and DEAN adjust their suits after exiting the impala and walk forward.


DEAN

We still got to see the new Raiders movie.


SAM

Saw it.


DEAN (incredulous)

Without me?


SAM

You were in Hell.


DEAN

That's no excuse.


DEAN looks off screen.


DEAN

Big pretzel!


SAM smiles and shakes his head.


DEAN takes two pretzels from vendor.


DEAN

Thank you.


DEAN hands SAM a pretzel.


SAM

Thank you.


Both SAM and DEAN take a bite of their pretzels.


JAMIE

Guten tag.


DEAN with his mouth full.

"Guten tag" yourself.


SAM looks over at a man in a Sheriff uniform.

Mmm. Looks like that's our man.


SAM and DEAN walk over to the man.


SAM

Sheriff Dietrich.


SHERIFF DIETRICH

Are you the boys from the fed?


SAM

Agents Angus and Young.


SAM and DEAN show their badges.


SAM

We called ahead about your, uh, problem.


SHERIFF DIETRICH

Right. Um… I'll tell you what, why don't we talk this out away from the crowd, huh?


Cut to MORGUE. Door opens and a body is taken out, covered with a sheet.


SHERIFF DIETRICH draws back the sheet.


SHERIFF DIETRICH

Marissa Wright, 26. Just up from Lockhard for the 'fest. Terrible. Just terrible. It's the last thing this town needs at peak tourist season.


SAM

Definitely the last thing Marissa Wright needed.


DEAN turns the body’s head and sees two dark puncture marks on her neck like a vampire bite.


DEAN

What the hell?


SHERIFF DIETRICH

Yeah, you got me -- I mean this killer's some kind of grade-A wacko, right? I mean, some Satan worshipping, Anne Rice-reading, gothic, psycho vampire wannabe.


DEAN

Sheriff, in your report, you mentioned a witness.


SHERIFF DIETRICH

Yeah, I wished I didn't. But our witness insisted. That's Ed Brewer. Not exactly what you'd call reliable.


EXT. Bar with waitresses dressed in Oktoberfest costumes. SAM and DEAN walk to the bar. JAMIE hands two beer glasses to LUCY, another waitress.


JAMIE

I remember you.


DEAN

And I remember you...


DEAN looks at her name badge


DEAN

Jamie. I never forget a pretty... everything.


SAM

We're looking for Ed Brewer.


JAMIE

What do you want with Ed?


DEAN

Well, we are uh... federal agents.


SAM and DEAN show their badges.


DEAN

Mr. Brewer was witness to a serious crime. We just need to -


JAMIE

Wait a minute. You're a fed? Wow, you don't come on like a fed. Seriously?


DEAN leans towards her.


DEAN

I'm a maverick, ma'am. A rebel with a badge. One thing I don’t play by: the rules.


DEAN winks.


SAM

Okay, maverick. Um, so where can we find Mr. Brewer?


SAM and DEAN are sitting across from ED BREWER at a table. ED BREWER uncaps his beer stein and drinks.


ED BREWER

I told the cops everything I saw. No one believes me. Why should you be any different?


DEAN

Believe me, Mr. Brewer, we're different.


BREWER

I spoke the God’s honest truth. And now I’m the town joke.


SAM

Marissa Wright’s murder is no joke to us. And we want to hear everything, no matter how strange it may seem.


DEAN

We have a lot of experience with strange.


BREWER uncaps the beer stein and drink again.


BREWER

It was just after midnight. I just left here, and like I do every night, I cut through the park on the way home. At first, I thought it was a couple kissing. But she was... struggling too much. And this man, he was -- well, he was biting her neck.


SAM

Can you describe her assailant?


BREWER

Oh, he was a vampire.


DEAN

Okay, right. And by that, you mean –


BREWER

You know, a vampire.


DEAN

Uh huh.


BREWER

Yeah.


DEAN

So, he looked like –


BREWER

He looked like a vampire. You know, with the fangs and the slicked back hair and the fancy cape and the little medallion thingy on the ribbon.


DEAN

You mean like a Dracula?


BREWER

Exactly, like a Dracula. Right down to the accent.


SAM

The accent?


BREWER

Yep.


SAM

What did he say?


BREWER

You know, something like…


BREWER raises his arm over his face as if he has a cape on.


BREWER

Stay away, mortal! The night is mine!

You do believe me, don't you?


Cut to JAMIE and LUCY at the bar.


JAMIE

They must be here following up on that murdered woman.


LUCY

Crazy Ed and his vampire story.


JAMIE

He might be weird, but he's not crazy.


LUCY

Look, you're just saying that ‘cause the guy has a crush on you and he tips you in 20’s.


LUCY blots her lips on a napkin and leaves it on the bar.


VOICE OFF STAGE

Lucy!


LUCY exits.


DEAN walks up to the bar.


DEAN

So, you got a beer back there for me?


JAMIE

I don't know, Agent Young, you off duty?


DEAN

And then some.


SAM comes up and picks up the napkin with LUCY’s lipstick print on it. They lean against the bar facing the room.


DEAN

So, what do you think? Goth, psycho, vampire wannabe, right?


SAM

Definitely not our kind of case.


DEAN

Agreed. But who cares?


SAM and DEAN walk toward a table.


DEAN

Room's paid for, and it's Oktoberfest. Come on, brother. Beer and bar wenches.


SAM and DEAN take a seat at a table.


SAM Pretty sure women today don't react well to the whole "wench" thing, Dean.


DEAN calls out to JAMIE.

Hey, bar wench, where's that beer?


JAMIE

Coming up, good sir!


DEAN

Dude, Oktoberfest.


JAMIE

There you go.


JAMIE turns to SAM.


JAMIE

What can I get you?


DEAN

Oh, he doesn't drink. He's a Christian scientist. Doesn't even take aspirin. He's a real drag on stakeouts.


JAMIE laughs.

You're funny.

DEAN

I'm a lot more than that. I'd love to get a chance to show you the rest. What time you get off?


JAMIE

Ha ha. Like I said, "funny."


JAMIE walks off.


DEAN

Man, it is time to right some wrongs.


SAM

Come again?


DEAN

Look at me. I mean, I came back from the furnace without any of my old scars, right? No bullet wounds, knife cuts, none of the off-angled fingers from all the breaks. I mean, my hide is as smooth as a baby's bottom. Which leads me to conclude, sadly... that my virginity is intact.


SAM

What?


DEAN

I have been re-hymenated.


DEAN takes a drink.


SAM

Re--?


SAM laughs.


SAM

Please. Dean, maybe angels can pull you out of hell, but no one could do that.


DEAN

Brother, I have been re-hymenated. And the dude will not abide.


SAM

All right, dude. Well, you go do whatever you got to do, and I'm gonna go back to the room and get some sleep.


SAM gets up and leaves.


DEAN walks back to the bar.


DEAN

So? How about tonight?


JAMIE

Oh, sorry. I promised Lucy a girls' night out.


DEAN glances over at LUCY.


JAMIE

Besides, no self-respecting bar wench lets herself get picked up by a customer on the first try.


DEAN

Well, I'm not a customer. I'm a federal agent.


JAMIE

Try again tomorrow, G-Man.


DEAN

I wish I could. I don't think we're staying on the case.


JAMIE

What? Is it too weird for you?


DEAN

Not weird enough.



ACT TWO
EXT. Car parked in secluded spot. The night of a full moon. It is foggy. Owl hoots. A couple is kissing in a car.


ANNA-MARIE

Rick. Did you hear that?


RICK

What?


ANNA-MARIE

It sounded like a wolf.


RICK

Come on, Marie, don't change the subject. I told you what could happen to a man if he doesn't --


ANNA-MARIE

Those stories aren't true.


RICK

They are. Baby, if a man doesn't get the stuff out of his system regularly, it can back up and cause all kinds of... medical type problems.


There is a shadow of hands, then a monster’s shadow on the car. ANNA-MARIE and RICH are kissing.


ANNA-MARIE

Shh, do you hear that?


RICK

Anna-Marie, there aren't any wolves in Pennsylvania.


A WEREWOLF breaks the window and pulls RICK out.


ANNA-MARIE screams.


EXT. The next day SAM and DEAN sit across from ANNA-MARIE at an outside table.


ANNA-MARIE is slurping loudly from a large cup. SAM and DEAN exchange a look.


ANNA-MARIE

And then it just -- it just tore Rick into little pieces.


DEAN

Ma'am, we understand how hard this is, but can you describe the creature?


ANNA-MARIE

Oh. It was a werewolf.


SAM

A werewolf?


ANNA-MARIE

Mhm.


SAM

You're sure?


ANNA-MARIE

Oh, yeah. With the furry face, and the black nose, and the claws and… and the the torn up pants and shirt. Like from the old movies.


SAM

Um...


DEAN

Well, okay, so... Thank you for your time.


SAM and DEAN get up and leave.


EXT. The morgue.


DEAN

First a Dracula and now a full on movie time Wolf Man? What the hell is going on in this town?


SAM opens one of the storage drawers and pulls out a body. He unzips the body bag. SAM and DEAN are disgusted at the smell.


DEAN

Damn!

SAM

All right. Whatever did this wasn't a psycho wannabe.


SAM pulls out some shredded flesh from the corpse with a pencil.


SAM

Look at those bite marks. Right down to the bone... and deeper.


DEAN

Strong enough to tear a healthy man apart limb from limb. Could be a werewolf.

SAM

Yeah, except, look. The heart's still there in one piece. They never leave the heart behind.

DEAN

Thus I reiterate -- what the hell is going on?


The SHERIFF enters the morgue.


SHERIFF

Well, I was hoping you boys could tell me. I just got a rush job back from the lab on those fibres we found on the body.


The SHERIFF pulls out a plastic bag from an envelope.


SHERIFF

Canine. Wolf hairs.


DEAN

I'm getting a headache.


EXT. The bar.


SAM and DEAN are sitting at a table eating.


DEAN

I don't know, man. Looks like we've stumbled onto a midnight showing of Dracula meets Wolf Man. Is that it?


SAM

I don't know. I mean, Wolf Man seems real enough. Makes Dracula seem a little less impossible, I guess.


DEAN

Yeah, but werewolves don't grow wolf hair. That's just a myth.


SAM

Yeah.


DEAN

So, what? We've got a vampire and a werewolf monster mashing this town?


JAMIE brings over another round of beer for SAM and DEAN.


JAMIE

Looks like you guys are staying a while. I heard about Rick Deacon.


DEAN

Yeah, this case just got weird enough for our department.


JAMIE

Well, beers are on me. And, just so you know, I get off at midnight tonight.


DEAN

Oh, it's not another, uh, girls' night out?


JAMIE

Doesn't have to be.


DEAN

Okay, then. I'll see you tonight.


JAMIE

Okay, then.


JAMIE leaves.


DEAN

Hey, you think this Dracula could turn into a bat? That would be cool.


ACT THREE
EXT. Museum at night time. Pan over sign that reads, “CANONSBURG MUSEUM OF AMERICAN HISTORY.” Inside, a guard is talking on a cell phone.


GUARD

Sorry to bother you. Yes, I do know what time it is… I was just wondering if you were expecting a delivery of some kind? I don’t know. Well, it looks old. That's right. Yeah, an Egyptian kind of deal. No, it was just sitting there on the loading dock. No, Doctor, there's no shipping invoice. There's no nothing.


The lid on the sarcophagus begins to move.


GUARD

I don't know when it was delivered, it was here when I clocked in tonight. I thought you’d know what to do. Think Helen has any record of it in her files?


The GUARD turns and see a mummy rising from the sarcophagus, he stumbles backward as the mummy leaves the sarcophagus and begins moving toward him.


GUARD

Holy mother of crap!


The GUARD shoots the mummy. It grabs his throat and lifts him up against the wall. The GUARD chokes as the mummy strangles him.


CUT to the museum later on. The police are moving around. The SHERIFF is seen talking to his men. SAM and DEAN investigate the sarcophagus.


SAM

This sarcophagus isn't ancient.


SAM holds up a tag that reads, “THE FX SHOP PROPHOUSE PHILDADELPHIA, PA.”


SAM

It's from a prop house in Philly.


DEAN

Well... it goes well with the bucket of dry ice he was keeping in it.


DEAN lifts up a small bucket of dry ice from inside the sarcophagus.


SAM

Is he making his own special effects?


DEAN

Yeah, a mummy with a good sense of showmanship.


SAM

This is stupid.


DEAN

Oh, damn it. Jamie. I'm late. You're good here with the mummy and the... crazy?


SAM

Yeah.


DEAN

Yeah.


DEAN leaves in a hurry.


JAMIE is standing outside the bar, looking at her watch.


JAMIE

Your loss, G-Man.


JAMIE starts walking away. She hears something behind her and turns around to see DRACULA.


DRACULA

Good evening.


JAMIE starts to run and DRACULA follows her.


DRACULA

I have watched you for many nights from afar. My passion knows no bounds, Mina!


JAMIE fumbles in her purse.


DRACULA

You are the reincarnation of my beloved, and I must have you.


JAMIE sprays DRACULA in the face with pepper spray and runs.


DRACULA

Mary, son of a...


DRACULA runs after JAMIE.


DEAN

Jamie!


JAMIE crashes into DEAN.


DEAN turns and sees DRACULA.


DEAN

Son of a bitch.


DRACULA

You should not use such language in the presence of my bride.


DEAN pauses.


DEAN

Okay.


DEAN punches DRACULA. They fight.


DEAN

Jamie, run!


DRACULA

You have no choice in the matter, Mr. Harker. Mina is mine.


DRACULA tries to bite DEAN. DEAN rips off DRACULA’s ear. He flees. DEAN pursues. DRACULA leaps over a gate and escapes on a moped.


INTERMISSION


ACT FOUR
EXT. Back at the bar. JAMIE and DEAN are sitting at a table. SAM walks over to them.


SAM

Hey. You guys all right?


DEAN

Yeah, I think so. And I think I know what's going on.


DEAN puts a folded towel on the table.


SAM

Yeah?


DEAN

Part of it, at least.


SAM opens the towel. DRACULA’s ear is inside.


SAM

Uh, the ear part?


DEAN

Ripped it off of Dracula's head. Touch it.


SAM touches the ear.


SAM

Ugh.


DEAN

Feel familiar to you?


SAM

Oh, man.


DEAN

Skin of a shapeshifter. Just like St. Louis and just like Milwaukee. Of course this one's all holding buckets of crazy. Oh, and, uh...


DEAN takes out a medallion from his pocket and gives it to SAM.


DEAN

This, I uh, pulled it off during the fight. Look at the label on the ribbon.


SAM looks at the label. It reads, “THE FX SHOP PROPHOUSE PHILADELPHIA, PA.”


SAM

It's a costume rental.


DEAN

All three monsters - the Dracula, Wolf Man, and the mummy -- all the same critter, which means we need to catch this freak before he Creature From the Black Lagoons somebody.


JAMIE

So, you guys are like Mulder and Scully or something, and The X-Files are real?


DEAN

No, The X-Files is a TV show. This is real.


JAMIE

Oh.


SAM

Okay, so, the stagecraft, the costuming… it's like he's trying to re-enact his favorite monster movie moments, right down to the bloody murders.


JAMIE

Wait a second. Who the hell is Mina?

SAM

Mina?


DEAN

Yeah. That's what he called Jamie. And he called me Mr. Harker.


SAM

Jonathan Harker? They're characters from the movies and the novels -- Mina, Dracula's intended bride, Harker the fiancé that stands in the way. Seems like he's fixating on you, like he sees you as his bride.


JAMIE

Wow. Lucky me.


SAM

But to fixate on you, my guess is that the shifter has to have seen you before or been around you.


DEAN

Jamie, has anybody strange come to town, somebody that has taken a specific notice of you?


JAMIE

I don't know, Dean. It's Oktoberfest. I'm a bartender. There's lots of people. I... wait a second. There is Ed.


SAM

"Ed Brewer" Ed?


JAMIE

Yeah. He moved here about a month ago. Lucy swears he has a crush on me. He comes in almost every night. But, you know, I don't think he's the type of guy –


DEAN

Where does Ed live?


JAMIE

I don't know. But he works at the old movie theater. I think he's the projectionist there.


SAM

Take care of Mina?


DEAN

Yep.


SAM leaves.


JAMIE is pacing in front of the booth Dean is sitting in.


JAMIE

So, monsters are real.


DEAN

Some of them, yeah.


JAMIE

And the shapeshifter, he can turn into different people.


DEAN

Yeah. Yeah, except this one's turning into the great monsters of screenland, which is a new one for me.


JAMIE

You're not really FBI, are you?


DEAN

Not so much.


JAMIE

So, this is what you do? You and your partner just tramp across the country on your own dime until you find some horrible nightmare to fight?


DEAN

Some people paint.


JAMIE

Wow.


DEAN

What?


JAMIE

That must suck. I mean, you're giving up your life for this terrible... I don't know, responsibility.


DEAN

Last few years, I started thinking that way, and, uh, it started sort of weighing on me. Of course, that was before... A little while ago, I had this – let’s call it a near-death experience. Very near.


JAMIE sits down next to DEAN.


DEAN

And, uh, when I came to... things were different. My life's been different. I realize that I help people. Not just help them, though. I save them. I guess it's -- it's awesome. It's kind of like a gift... like a mission. Kind of like a... a mission from God.


JAMIE

So, does that make you... some kind of monk or something? You know, celibate?


DEAN

Man, I hope not.


DEAN and JAMIE kiss.


LUCY turns the lights on and they break apart.


LUCY

Holy crap. Oh, my god. Jamie. Guys, I'm -- I'm sorry. I thought you guys were going out.


JAMIE

Lucy, it's -- it's okay. Uh, listen –


LUCY

You know what? I just -- I came to borrow a bottle. I kind of got something going back at my... Anyway, uh, you guys look really busy, so I'm just gonna get out of your hair.


JAMIE

No, seriously, Lucy, it's been a crazy night. Stay for a drink.


DEAN

Yeah. Stay for a drink.


EXT. The movie theatre. PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is showing. Organ music swells as SAM walks in. SAM checks the clip in his gun then walks towards a shadow of a man playing an organ. ED BREWER switches the music to something happy.


BREWER turns around in surprise.

Whoa!


SAM pushes him against the organ and holds him at gun point.


BREWER

You, FBI man -- What did I –


SAM

Shut up, okay, you know what you did.


BREWER

What?


SAM

I know what you are.


BREWER

I'm not anything. I just like to play the Casio.


SAM

Had time to grow the ear back, huh?


BREWER

What?!


SAM pulls on BREWER’S ear. BREWER screams in pain.


SAM

It's supposed to come off.


BREWER

No, it's not!


EXT. Back at the bar. DEAN, JAMIE and LUCY are all sitting around the table.


LUCY

Oh, that sounds awful. Jamie, honey, are you okay?


JAMIE

Oh, I am fine. He didn't even touch me. Dean, he just blew right in and fought him off.


DEAN

Well, I didn't actually fly, but I'm sure it seemed that way at the time.


LUCY blots her lipstick on a napkin.


JAMIE

It was really, really something.


DEAN

Jamie?


LUCY

So, Dean, are you like a black belt or what?


DEAN looks at his glass, it swims before his eyes.


LUCY

Well, I guess they train you to fight at the academy or whatever.


DEAN leans across and punches LUCY. He pushes JAMIE out of the way.


JAMIE

Dean, what are you doing?


JAMIE passes out, falling back down into the booth.


DEAN

It's you, isn't it?


LUCY pushes her jaw back into place. DEAN kicks her again.


DEAN

Oh, damn it! What did you put in our drinks?!


DEAN smashes a bottle on the edge of table.


DEAN

That's all right. I'll skin you myself.


DEAN passes out.


LUCY

And… scene.


ACT FIVE
EXT. A dungeon. DEAN is unconscious and strapped to an upright table wearing lederhosen.


DEAN wakes up.


DEAN

Oh, come on.


DEAN looks at a portrait of a woman’s face on the wall which resembles LUCY.


DRACULA

She is beautiful, no? Bride number three from the first film. She never got the acclaim that she deserved. Which is why I chose her shape, her form, to move among the mortals unnoticed. To listen to the cricket songs of the living. That is when I discovered my bride had been reborn in this century.


DEAN

I can't get over what a pumpkin-pie-eyed, crazy son of a bitch you really are. You're not Dracula! You get that, right? Or even if you think you are Dracula, what the hell's up with the mummy?!


DRACULA punches DEAN in the face.


DRACULA

I am all monsters!


DEAN

Life ain't a movie, you sorry sack of –


DRACULA punches DEAN again.


DEAN Aah.


DRACULA

Life is small. Meagre. Messy. The movies are grand, simple, elegant. I have chosen elegance.


DEAN

You think "elegance" is really the word for what you did to Marissa, or Rick Deacon, or any of the others?!


DRACULA

But of course. It is a monster movie, after all.


DEAN

You do realize what happens at the end of every monster movie?


DRACULA

Ah, but this movie is mine. And in it, the monster wins. The monster gets the girl. And the hero, he’s... electrocuted. And tonight, Jonathan Harker, you will be my hero.


DRACULA puts his hand on a large lever on the wall. DEAN chuckles nervously.


DEAN

W-w-wait, wait, wait.


DEAN struggles to escape.


The doorbell rings.


DRACULA

Please, excuse me.


DRACULA leaves. Cut to DRACULA walks through a modern looking hallway. The doorbell rings again. DRACULA opens the door and a pizza boy is standing outside.


DRACULA

Good evening.


DELIVERY BOY

Uh… pizza delivery.


DRACULA

Ah, you've brought a repast. Excellent. Continue to be of such service, and your life will be spared.


DELIVERY BOY

Uh huh.


The DELIVERY BOY pulls out pizza from his bag and holds it out.


DELIVERY BOY

That'll be $15.50.


DRACULA

Tell me...


DELIVERY BOY

Yeah?


DRACULA

...is there garlic on this pizza?


DELIVERY BOY

I don't know. Did you order garlic?


DRACULA

No!


DELIVERY BOY

Then no. Look, mister, I got four other deliveries to make. You want to just pay me the money so I can go?


DRACULA

Of course, yes, but I have a coupon.


EXT. Back at the bar. SAM enters and walks around. He takes out his cell phone and calls DEAN.


SAM

Dean, hey listen. Uh, Ed is not our guy. Um, I'm guessing you're at home with Jamie, so just give me a call, okay?


SAM hangs up. He looks down and sees the broken bottle on the floor, and the napkin with LUCY’S lipstick on it.


SAM

Lucy.


EXT. A bedroom in DRACULA’s house. JAMIE is lying on the bed. She wakes up.


DRACULA

You wake.


DRACULA gestures to a white satin dress hanging by the bed.


DRACULA

The gown. It suits your beauty. Please, put it on.


JAMIE

Where am I? What have you done with Dean?


DRACULA

Harker is resting elsewhere. Please, put on the gown and you may dine. We are having pizza.


JAMIE

What?! What is wrong with you? You made up Lucy, right? Pretended to be my friend.


DRACULA

I needed to know if you were the one.


JAMIE

You could try talking to people! But instead you become this?


DRACULA

The gown.


JAMIE

I don’t want to play your stupid game, okay?! I just -- I just want to go home.


DRACULA yells.

Put on the gown!


EXT. The front door of DRACULA’s house. SAM picks the lock and he enters, holding his gun at the ready.


EXT. The bedroom. JAMIE is now wearing the gown.


DRACULA

I-I scared you. You’re the only one I don’t want to scare. I used to love the movies.


JAMIE

They aren't real. You can’t make them real.


DRACULA

"Real" is being born this way. Different. "Real" is having your dad call you "monster" -- it's the first time you hear the word. And he tries to beat you to death with a shovel. Everywhere I ran, everywhere I tried to hide, people found me, dragged me out, attacked me. Called me "freak," called me "monster." Then I found them. The great monsters. In their movies, they were strong. They were feared. They were beautiful. And now I am like them. Commanding. Terrifying.


JAMIE

Lonely.


DRACULA

Was lonely. Now I -- I have you.


JAMIE

Ever think that maybe you're lonely because you kill people?


DRACULA

Or I kill people because I’m lonely.


There is the sound of something being knocked over in the next room.


DRACULA

Did you hear that?


JAMIE

What? Dean? Dean?!


DRACULA hits her, knocking her out.


EXT. The dungeon. DEAN is still trapped. SAM enters.


DEAN

Oh, thank God. Just in the nick of time. That guy was about to Frankenstein me.


SAM unties DEAN.


SAM

Hey there, Hansel.


DEAN

Shut up!


DEAN gestures for SAM to kick down the door. SAM puts his foot through the door, punching a hole in it. The entire door falls flat off its hinges.


SAM

Let's go.


EXT. The bedroom. SAM opens the door and crosses to JAMIE lying on the bed. DRACULA intercepts him from behind and throws him through the wall.


DRACULA

You will never be Van Helsing!


DEAN attacks him. They fight.


DRACULA

And you, Harker, now you die.


DEAN

How 'bout now you shut the hell up?


DEAN is thrown to the ground, DRACULA raises his arms, about to go in for the kill. He is shot in the chest.


DRACULA

Silver?


DRACULA turns to see JAMIE holding the gun.


DRACULA

It was beauty that killed the beast. No, Mina, do not weep.


DRACULA falls into a chair.


DRACULA

Perhaps this is how the movie should end.


DRACULA dies in the chair.


EXT. The town square. DEAN and JAMIE are kissing.


JAMIE

Well, thank you, G-Man. You have been a great service to your country.


DEAN

Oh, yes, I'm very, very patriotic.


SAM is standing behind DEAN. DEAN looks over his shoulder at him. SAM smiles tensely. DEAN turns back to JAMIE.


DEAN

Bye.


JAMIE

Bye.


DEAN and SAM begin to walk away.


JAMIE

You guys saved my life, you know? So, thanks.


JAMIE leaves.


SAM

I like her.


DEAN

Feels good to be back on the job, doesn't it?


SAM

Yeah, it does.


DEAN

The hero gets the girl, monster gets the gank. All in all, happy ending -- with a happy ending, no less.


SAM

Real classy, Dean.


DEAN

Hey, all I'm saying is the shifter man had a point, you know? It would be nice if life was movie simple. Although, if I was turning life into a movie, I wouldn't do this Abbott and Costello meet the monster crap.


SAM

Yeah, no. I know what you’d pick.


DEAN

No, you don't.


SAM

Yeah, I do.


DEAN

No. You don't. You don't!


SAM

Porky's II.


DEAN

What?
