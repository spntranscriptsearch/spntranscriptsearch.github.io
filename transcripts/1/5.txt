Toledo, Ohio

INT. SHOEMAKER LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Three GIRLS are laughing, gathered around a table with candles. The candlelight is the only light.

GIRL 1
Okay, your turn, truth or dare?

LILY
Truth.

GIRL 1
Do you want to make out with Benji Swartz?

GIRL 2 laughs.

LILY
Dare.

GIRL 1
Okay, lame. You have to...say "Bloody Mary" in the bathroom.

LILY
Is that the best you can come up with?

GIRL 2
Who's Bloody Mary?

GIRL 1
She's this witch.

LILY
I heard she was a lady killed in a car crash.

GIRL 1
It doesn't matter who she is. Point is, if you say her name three times in the bathroom mirror she appears...and scratches your eyes out!

LILY and GIRL 2 jump.

GIRL 2
So why would anyone say it?

LILY
Because it isn't real.

LILY gets up, and GIRL 1 hands her a candle.

GIRL 1
No turning on the lights, and remember...three times.

INT. BATHROOM – NIGHT

LILY opens the bathroom door. She looks at the shadows on the wall, then closes the door and puts the candle down in front of the mirror.

LILY
Bloody Mary. This is so stupid. Bloody Mary.

The candle flickers. LILY looks at it. A long pause.

LILY
Bloody Mary.

A pause. A loud noise. LILY shrieks. Pounding on the door.

EXT. HALLWAY – NIGHT

LILY opens the door to find GIRLS 1 and 2, laughing.

GIRL 1
Scared ya.

LILY
You guys are jerks.

STEVEN
Lily.

LILY looks up to the top of the stairs, where she sees her father, STEVEN SHOEMAKER.

STEVEN
Do you mind keeping it down?

LILY
Sorry, Daddy.

GIRLS 1 & 2
Sorry, Mr. Shoemaker.

STEVEN heads upstairs. He passes several mirrors; each has BLOODY MARY.

INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM – NIGHT

STEVEN takes some pills out of the bathroom medicine cabinet and closes the cabinet, revealing another mirror. He pops the pills in his mouth, then looks closer at the mirror, noticing some scratches under his eye.

INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

LILY and both GIRLS are giggling together.

GIRL 2
You so like him!

DONNA, LILY's older sister, comes in the front door.

DONNA
Hey, geek. You guys having fun?

LILY
You're out past curfew.

DONNA
Thanks, Dad.

DONNA goes upstairs.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY – NIGHT

A pool of blood coming out from under the bathroom door. DONNA rounds the corner and sees it, stops, then starts forward more slowly. She hesitantly pushes open the bathroom door, revealing a great deal more blood. DONNA screams.

ACT ONE
DREAM SEQUENCE
INT. STANFORD APARTMENT – NIGHT

The entire scene is tinted blue.

From 1.01 Pilot, SAM lies on the bed, eyes closed. JESS is on the ceiling. Blood drips on SAM's forehead. He opens his eyes and sees her.

JESS
Why, Sam? Why, Sam?

SAM
No!

JESS bursts into flame.

JESS
Why, Sam? Why, Sam?

IMPALA
INT. IMPALA – DAY

DEAN
Sam, wake up.

SAM wakes, confused. He sits up and looks around. He's sitting shotgun in the Impala, which is parked in front of a large building.

Yeah, another one.

SAM
Hey, at least I got some sleep.

DEAN
You know, sooner or later we're gonna have to talk about this.

SAM
Are we here?

DEAN
Yup. Welcome to Toledo, Ohio.

SAM picks up a newspaper with STEVEN SHOEMAKER's obituary circled.

SHOEMAKER, Steven
The Shoemaker family is sad to announce the sudden death of their beloved husband and father Steven Shoemaker. Steven was 46. A short service will be held on Wednesday, [...] 31 at 2:00 p.m. at the Toledo [...] and cherish you [...] Your [...]

DEAN looks at SAM.

MORGUE TECH
Uh, look, man...no.

DEAN laughs a little.

Directed by
PETER ELLIS

DEAN turns around and mumbles.

DEAN
I'm gonna hit him in his face I swear.

SAM hits DEAN on the arm. He steps in front of DEAN and opens his wallet and pulls out some twenties. He lays a few of them, at least five, down on the MORGUE TECH's desk. The MORGUE TECH picks up the money.

MORGUE TECH
Follow me.

The MORGUE TECH gets up and leaves. DEAN grabs SAM when SAM tries to follow.

DEAN
Dude, I earned that money.

SAM
You won it in a poker game.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM follows the MORGUE TECH.

INT. MORGUE – DAY

SAM
Now the newspaper said his daughter found him. She said his eyes were bleeding.

The MORGUE TECH pulls back the sheet over STEVEN's face.

MORGUE TECH
More than that. They practically liquefied.

DEAN
Any sign of a struggle? Maybe somebody did it to him?

MORGUE TECH
Nope. Besides the daughter, he was all alone.

SAM
What's the official cause of death.

MORGUE TECH
Ah, Doc's not sure. He's thinking massive stroke, maybe an aneurysm? Something burst up in there, that's for sure.

SAM
What do you mean?

MORGUE TECH
Intense cerebral bleeding. This guy had more blood in his skull than anyone I've ever seen.

SAM
The eyes&mash;what would cause something like that?

MORGUE TECH
Capillaries can burst. See a lot of bloodshot eyes with stroke victims.

DEAN
Yeah? You ever see exploding eyeballs?

MORGUE TECH
That's a first for me, but hey, I'm not the doctor.

DEAN
Hey, think we could take a look at that police report? You know for, uh...our paper.

MORGUE TECH
I'm not really supposed to show you that.

SAM, annoyed, pulls out his wallet.

INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

SAM and DEAN are walking down stairs.

SAM
Might not be one of ours. Might just be some freak medical thing.

DEAN
How many times in Dad's long and varied career has it actually been a freak medical thing and not some sign of an awful supernatural death?

SAM
Uh, almost never.

DEAN
Exactly.

SAM
All right, let's go talk to the daughter.

SHOEMAKER HOUSE
INT. SHOEMAKER HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and SAM walk into the funeral. There is a picture of STEVEN SHOEMAKER on the desk. The attendees are all men in black suits and women in black dresses, except DEAN and SAM.

DEAN
Feel like we're underdressed.

They keep walking through the house towards the back.

EXT. SHOEMAKER BACKYARD – DAY

A MAN points DEAN and SAM towards DONNA and LILY SHOEMAKER, who are with their friends JILL and CHARLIE.

DEAN
You must be Donna, right?

DONNA
Yeah.

SAM
Hi, uh—we're really sorry.

DONNA
Thank you.

SAM
I'm Sam, this is Dean. We worked with your dad.

DONNA looks at CHARLIE, then back at SAM and DEAN.

DONNA
You did?

DEAN
Yeah. This whole thing. I mean, a stroke.

CHARLIE
I don't think she really wants to talk about this right now

DONNA
It's okay. I'm okay.

DEAN
Were there any symptoms? Dizziness? Migraines?

DONNA
No.

LILY turns around.

LILY
That's because it wasn't a stroke.

DONNA
Lily, don't say that.

SAM
What?

DONNA
I'm sorry, she's just upset.

LILY
No, it happened because of me.

DONNA
Sweetie, it didn't.

SAM
Lily.

SAM gets down on eye level with LILY.

SAM
Why would you say something like that?

LILY
Right before he died, I said it.

SAM
You said what?

LILY
Bloody Mary, three times in the bathroom mirror.

A pause.

LILY
She took his eyes, that's what she does.

DONNA
That's not why Dad died. This isn't your fault.

DEAN
I think your sister's right, Lily. There's no way it could have been Bloody Mary. Your dad didn't say it, did he?

LILY
No, I don't think so.

INSIDE SHOEMAKER HOUSE
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY – DAY

Focus on one of the mirrors. SAM and DEAN are seen in the mirror approaching it, then rounding the corner.

INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM – DAY

SAM pushes the door open. There is still some dried blood on the floor.

SAM
The Bloody Mary legend...Dad ever find any evidence that it was a real thing?

DEAN
Not that I know of.

DEAN walks into the bathroom and. SAM stoops to the floor and touches the dried blood.

SAM
I mean, everywhere else all over the country, kids will play Bloody Mary, and as far as we know, nobody dies from it.

DEAN
Yeah, well, maybe everywhere it's just a story, but here it's actually happening.

SAM
The place where the legend began?

DEAN shrugs and opens the medicine cabinet.

SAM
But according to the legend, the person who says B—

SAM looks at the medicine cabinet mirror, which now faces him, and closes it.

SAM
The person who says you know what gets it. But here—

DEAN
Shoemaker gets it instead, yeah.

SAM
Right.

DEAN
Never heard anything like that before. Still, the guy did die right in front of the mirror, and the daughter's right. The way the legend goes, you know who scratches your eyes out.

SAM
It's worth checking in to.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY – DAY

A woman visible from knees down approaches.

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

SAM and DEAN leave the bathroom.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY – DAY

CHARLIE
What are you doing up here?

DEAN
We—we, had to go to the bathroom.

CHARLIE
Who are you?

DEAN
Like we said downstairs, we worked with Donna's dad.

CHARLIE
He was a day trader or something. He worked by himself.

DEAN
No, I know, I meant—

CHARLIE
And all those weird questions downstairs, what was that? So you tell me what's going on, or I start screaming.

SAM
All right, all right. We think something happened to Donna's dad.

CHARLIE
Yeah, a stroke.

SAM
That's not a sign of a typical stroke. We think it might be something else.

CHARLIE
Like what?

SAM
Honestly? We don't know yet. But we don't want it to happen to anyone else. That's the truth.

DEAN
So, if you're gonna scream, go right ahead.

CHARLIE
Who are you, cops?

SAM looks over his shoulder at DEAN.

DEAN
Something like that.

SAM
I'll tell you what. Here.

SAM reaches into his pocket, pulls out a paper and pen, and starts writing down his cell number.

SAM
If you think of anything, you or your friends notice anything strange, out of the ordinary...just give us a call.

SAM hands her the paper as he and DEAN walk down the hallway.

LIBRARY
INT. LIBRARY – DAY

SAM and DEAN walk into a library, rather dark for the time of day.

DEAN
All right, say Bloody Mary really is haunting this town. There's gonna be some sort of proof—Like a local woman who died nasty.

SAM
Yeah but a legend this widespread it's hard. I mean, there's like 50 versions of who she actually is. One story says she's a witch, another says she's a mutilated bride, there's a lot more. {They walk in to the actual library.}

DEAN
All right so what are we supposed to be looking for?

SAM
Every version's got a few things in common. It's always a woman named Mary, and she always dies right in front of a mirror. So we've gotta search local newspapers—public records as far back as they go. See if we can find a Mary who fits the bill.

DEAN
Well that sounds annoying.

SAM
No it won't be so bad, as long as we...{He looks at the computers which all say "Out of Order" on them.} *chuckles* I take it back. This will be very annoying.

{Cut scene to DONNA's friend driving in a car talking on her cell phone.}

Charlie
I'm not sure. They were cops or detectives or something.

{The phone conversation is between DONNA's friend and another girl who was at the funeral named Jill. Jill is in her room taking off her sweater.}

Jill
Whoever they were, they were cute.

Charlie
Jill

Jill
You didn't think so?

Charlie
Yeah okay they were cute. Still, do you think something happened to DONNA's dad?

Jill
Maybe LILY was right. Maybe Bloody Mary got him.

Charlie
Ha ha, very funny.

Jill
Wait, I'm sorry. Was that fear I hear in your voice?

Charlie
No.

Jill
Charlie, I'm walking to the bathroom mirror right now.

Charlie
Jill, quit it.

Jill
{She gets to her bathroom mirror.} Oh no, I can't help myself. I'm gonna say it. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

Charlie
{There is a silence on the phone.} Jill? {Jill screams.} Jill!?!

Jill
{Starts laughing} You're such a freak, I'll call you tomorrow. {They hang up the phone and Jill goes to her closet to finish getting changed. She opens the door, and on the inside there is a mirror, where we see Bloody Mary. She closes the closet door and goes to sit down at her vanity, where of course there is another mirror. We see Bloody Mary as she takes her earrings out, and then her reflection again when Jill walks in front of her TV screen. Jill goes back in the bathroom to wash her face, but as she bends down to wash, her reflection in the mirror stays standing. She looks up and sees her reflection looking at her as if it were another person. Jill starts panicking as the reflection in the mirror starts oozing blood out of its eyes. She reaches up and feels blood on her own face.}

Reflection
You did it. You killed that boy.

{Jill falls down after seemingly being strangled to death as her reflection in the mirror watches her.}

{COMMERCIAL}

{Cut to SAM's dream again. The flames sucked up into Jessica's body, we hear "Why SAM?" and SAM wakes up.}

SAM
Why'd you let me fall asleep?

DEAN
Cause I'm an awesome brother. So what did you dream about?

SAM
Lollipops and candy canes.

DEAN
Yeah, sure.

SAM
Did you find anything?

DEAN
Oh besides a whole new level of frustration? {SAM sits up.} No. I've looked at everything. A few local women, a Laura and a Catherine committed suicide in front of a mirror, and a giant mirror fell on a guy named Dave, but uh, no Mary.

SAM
{Falls back on the bed.} Maybe we just haven't found it yet.

DEAN
I've also been searching for strange deaths in the area, you know...eyeball bleeding, that sort of thing. There's nothing. Whatever's happening here, maybe it just ain't Mary.

{SAM's cell phone rings. He answers it.}

SAM
Hello? {We do not hear who is calling, but a look of concern comes across SAM's face.}

{Cut scene to a park bench. Charlie is sitting there and DEAN is sitting on the back of it, and SAM is standing there. Charlie is crying.}

Charlie
And they found her on the bathroom floor. And her—her eyes. They were gone.

SAM
I'm sorry.

Charlie
And she said it. {DEAN looks up at SAM.} I heard her say it. But it couldn't be because of that. I'm insane, right?

DEAN
No, you're not insane.

Charlie
Oh God, that makes me feel so much worse.

SAM
Look. We think something's happening here. Something that can't be explained.

DEAN
And we're gonna stop it but we could use your help.

{Cut scene to Jill's room. Charlie comes in and locks the door. She then goes over to the window and opens it, where SAM and DEAN are waiting to enter. SAM enters first and DEAN throws him a duffel bag. SAM sets it on the bed and starts going through it.}

SAM
What did you tell Jill's mom?

Charlie
Just that I needed some time alone with Jill's pictures and things. {SAM pulls something out of the bag and DEAN shuts the curtains.} I hate lying to her.

DEAN
Trust us, this is for the greater good. Hit the lights.

Charlie
{goes over to turn off the lights.} What are you guys looking for?

DEAN
We'll let you know as soon as we find it.

SAM
{has a digital camera ready, and hands it to DEAN.} Hey, night vision. {DEAN turns on the night vision for him.} Perfect.

{The digital camera is aimed at DEAN.}

DEAN
Do I look like Paris Hilton?

{SAM walks away with the camera. He opens Jill's closet door and begins filming around the mirror.}

SAM
So I don't get it. I mean...the first victim didn't summon Mary, and the second victim did. How's she choosing them?

DEAN
Beats me.

{SAM closes the closet door.}

DEAN
I want to know why Jill said it in the first place.

Charlie
It's just a joke.

DEAN
Yeah well somebody's gonna say it again, it's just a matter of time.

{SAM is in the bathroom filming around the mirror when he stops and sees trickles of something running out from behind the mirror.}

SAM
Hey. {DEAN and Charlie turn to look at him.} There's a black light in the trunk, right?

{SAM has carried the mirror out to Jill's bed and lays it on the bed upside down. DEAN throws him a black light. SAM peels off the brown paper that is on the back of the mirror. SAM shines the black light over the back of the mirror and we see a handprint, and the words "Gary Bryman."}

Charlie
Gary Bryman?

SAM
You know who that is?

Charlie
No.

{Cut scene to outside, again on a bench. DEAN and Charlie are sitting on it, and SAM comes up behind them.}

SAM
So, Gary Bryman was an 8-year-old boy. Two years ago he was killed in a hit and run. The car was described as a black Toyota Camry. But nobody got the plates or saw the driver.

Charlie
Oh my God.

SAM
What?

Charlie
Jill drove that car.

DEAN
We need to get back to your friend DONNA's house.

{Cut scene to the bathroom of DONNA's house. SAM and DEAN are hunched over the back of the mirror with a black light. There is a handprint on it, and the words "Linda Shoemaker".}

SAM
Linda Shoemaker.

{Cut scene to downstairs with DONNA.}

DONNA
Why are you asking me this?

SAM
Look, we're sorry, but it's important.

DONNA
Yeah. Linda's my mom okay? She overdosed on sleeping pills, it was an accident, and that's it. I think you should leave.

DEAN
Now DONNA, just listen.

DONNA
Get out of my house! {she runs upstairs.}

Charlie
Oh my God. Do you really think her dad could've killed her mom?

SAM
Maybe.

Charlie
I think I should stick around.

DEAN
All right. Whatever you do, don't—

Charlie
Believe me, I won't say it.

{Cut scene to DEAN at a computer and SAM looking at some things posted on a bulletin board.}

SAM
Wait, wait, wait, you're doing a nationwide search?

DEAN
Yep. The NCIC, the FBI database—at this point any Mary who died in front of a mirror is good enough for me.

SAM
But if she's haunting the town, she should have died in the town.

DEAN
I'm telling you there's nothing local, I've checked. So unless you got a better idea—

SAM
The way Mary's choosing her victims, it seems like there's a pattern.

DEAN
I know, I was thinking the SAMe thing.

SAM
With mister Shoemaker and Jill's hit and run.

DEAN
Both had secrets where people died.

SAM
Right. I mean there's a lot of folklore about mirrors-that they reveal all your lies, all your secrets, that they're a true reflection of your soul, which is why it's bad luck to break them.

DEAN
Right, right. So maybe if you've got a secret, I mean like a really nasty one where someone died, then Mary sees it, and punishes you for it.

SAM
Whether you're the one that summoned her or not.

DEAN
Take a look at this. {Cut to a picture of a woman lying by a mirror in a puddle of blood. DEAN prints out another picture and hands it to SAM. The picture is of a handprint and the letters "Tre"}

SAM
Looks like the SAMe handprint.

DEAN
Her name was Mary Worthington—an unsolved murder in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

{Cut to a police or detective agency, and the words "Fort Wayne, Indiana" come on the screen.}

Detective
I was on the job for 35 years-detective for most of that. Now everybody packs it in with a few loose ends, but the Mary Worthington murder—that one still gets me.

DEAN
What exactly happened?

Detective
You boys said you were reporters?

SAM
We know Mary was 19, lived by herself. We know she won a few local beauty contests, dreamt of getting out of Indiana, being an actress. And we know the night of March 29th someone broke into her apartment and murdered her, cut out her eyes with a knife.

Detective
That's right.

SAM
See sir, when we asked you what happened, we wanted to know what you think happened.

{Cut scene to the detective pulling some files out of a file cabinet.}

Detective
Technically I'm not supposed to have a copy of this. {He opens a file to the picture SAM and DEAN found on the computer.} Now see that there? T-R-E?

DEAN
Yeah.

Detective
I think Mary was trying to spell out the name of her killer.

SAM
You know who it was?

Detective
Not for sure. But there was a local man, a surgeon-Trevor SAMpson. {He pulls out a picture of a man.} And I think her cut her up good.

SAM
Now why would he do something like that?

Detective
Her diary mentioned a man that she was seeing. She called him by his initial, "T". Well, her last entry, she was gonna tell "T"'s wife about their affair.

DEAN
Yeah but how do you know it was SAMpson who killed her?

Detective
It's hard to say, but the way her eyes were cut out...it was almost professional.

DEAN
But you could never prove it?

Detective
No. No prints, no witnesses. He was meticulous.

DEAN
Is he still alive?

Detective
Nope. {sits down and sighs} If you ask me, Mary spent her last living moments trying to expose this guy's secret. But she never could.

SAM
Where's she buried?

Detective
She wasn't. She was cremated.

DEAN
What about that mirror {nods at the one in the picture}. It's not in some evidence lockup somewhere is it?

Detective
Ah, no. It was returned to Mary's family a long time ago.

SAM
You have the names of her family by any chance?

{Cut scene to the inside of a girl's bathroom at a school where DONNA and Charlie are walking in.}

DONNA
I mean, you bring these strangers into my house and they ask me things like that?

Charlie
They were only trying to help. Please, DONNA, you have to believe me.

DONNA
What? About Bloody Mary? {Of course they have now stopped in front of the mirror.}

Charlie
Please, I know it sounds crazy—

DONNA
Crazy doesn't even begin to cover it. I mean it's one thing for my sister to believe this crap, she's 12. But you?

Charlie
Think about the way your dad died, okay? And the way Jill died.

DONNA
Okay so {she turns to face the mirror} Bloody Mary.

Charlie
No!

DONNA
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. {She turns back to face Charlie} See? Nothing happened.

Charlie
Why would you do that?

DONNA
Oh my God. There really is something wrong with you.

{Cut scene to the school halls. Charlie is walking down past some windows into the classroom, and we see Bloody Mary in one of them.}

{COMMERCIAL}

{We come back to a physics/science class at Charlie's school.}

Teacher
Elements that loose electrons become positive ions, which are smaller than other atoms of the SAMe element. {Charlie opens up her compact.} Therefore the ionic radius is smaller than the atomic radius. {Charlie sees Bloody Mary in the corner and screams. The class freaks out as she starts running around the room.} Charlie! {She sees the reflection of Mary in the window of the door, picks up a stool, and throws it through the window.} Charlie!!! {The teacher catches Charlie.} Charlie stop it! What's wrong!? Just calm down.{Charlie sees Mary in the reflection of the teacher's glasses.}

Charlie
Aah! Let me go!

Teacher
Charlie! {Charlie runs out of the room.}

{Cut to SAM and DEAN driving down the road. SAM is on his cell phone.}

SAM
Oh really? Ah that's too bad Mr. Worthington. I would have paid a lot for that mirror. Okay, well maybe next time. All right, thanks. {SAM hangs up.}

DEAN
So?

SAM
So that was Mary's brother. The mirror was in the family for years, until he sold it one week ago to a store called Estate Antiques. A store in Toledo.

DEAN
So wherever the mirror goes, that's where Mary goes?

SAM
Her spirit's definitely tied up with it somehow.

DEAN
Isn't there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits?

SAM
Yeah there is. Yeah, when someone would die in a house people would cover up the mirrors so the ghost wouldn't get trapped.

DEAN
So Mary dies in front of a mirror, and it draws in her spirit.

SAM
Yeah but how could she move through like a hundred different mirrors?

DEAN
I don't know, but if the mirror is the source, I say we find it and smash it.

SAM
Yeah, I don't know, maybe. {SAM's cell phone rings.} Hello. {The look of concern comes across his face again} Charlie?

{Cut scene to wherever SAM and DEAN where staying. Charlie is sitting on the bed with her head on her knees and SAM and DEAN have all of the curtains drawn shut, and are throwing sheets over the mirrors, or facing them to the wall or floor.}

SAM
{Sits next to Charlie} Hey, hey it's ok. Hey, you can open up your eyes Charlie. It's okay, all right?

{Charlie looks up slowly.}

SAM
Now listen. You're gonna stay right here on this bed, and you're not gonna look at glass, or anything else that has a reflection, okay? And as long as you do that, she cannot get you.

Charlie
But I can't keep that up forever. I'm gonna die, aren't I?

SAM
No. No. Not anytime soon.

DEAN
{Sits on the bed too} All right Charlie. We need to know what happened.

Charlie
We were in the bathroom. DONNA said it.

DEAN
That's not what we're talking about. Something happened, didn't it? In your life...a secret...where someone got hurt. Can you tell us about it?

Charlie
I had this boyfriend. I loved him. But he kind of scared me too, you know? And one night, at his house, we got in this fight. Then I broke up with him, and he got upset, and he said he needed me and he loved me, and he said "Charlie, if you walk out that door right now, I'm gonna kill myself." And you know what I said? I said "Go ahead." And I left. How could I say that? How could I leave him like that? I just...I didn't believe him, you know? I should have. {She puts her face back on her knees and starts crying again.}

{Cut scene to SAM and DEAN driving in the rain.}

DEAN
You know her boyfriend killing himself, that's not really Charlie's fault.

SAM
You know as well as I do spirits don't exactly see shades of gray, DEAN. Charlie had a secret, someone died, that's good enough for Mary.

DEAN
I guess.

SAM
You know, I've been thinking. It might not be enough to just smash that mirror.

DEAN
Why, what do you mean?

SAM
Well Mary's hard to pin down, right? I mean she moves around from mirror to mirror so who's to say that she's not just gonna keep hiding in them forever? So maybe we should try to pin her down, you know, summon her to her mirror and then smash it.

DEAN
Well how do you know that's going to work?

SAM
I don't, not for sure.

DEAN
Well who's gonna summon her?

SAM
I will. She'll come after me.

DEAN
You know what, that's it. {He pulls the car over.} This is about Jessica, isn't it? You think that's your dirty little secret that you killed her somehow? SAM, this has got to stop, man. I mean, the nightmares and calling her name out in the middle of the night—it's gonna kill you. Now listen to me—It wasn't your fault. If you wanna blame something, then blame the thing that killed her. Or hell, why don't you take a swing at me? I mean I'm the one that dragged you away from her in the first place.

SAM
I don't blame you.

DEAN
Well you shouldn't blame yourself, because there's nothing you could've done.

SAM
I could've warned her.

DEAN
About what? You didn't know what was gonna happen! And besides, all of this isn't a secret, I mean I know all about it. It's not gonna work with Mary anyway.

SAM
No you don't.

DEAN
I don't what?

SAM
You don't know all about it. I haven't told you everything.

DEAN
What are you talking about?

SAM
Well it wouldn't really be a secret if I told you, would it?

DEAN
{looks surprised} No. I don't like it. It's not gonna happen, forget it.

SAM
DEAN that girl back there is going to die unless we do something about it. And you know what? Who knows how many more people are gonna die after that? Now we're doing this. You've got to let me do this.

{Cut scene to the shop. SAM is trying to pick the lock on the door. It opens and they see many mirrors are in this shop.}

DEAN
Well...that's just great. {He pulls out the picture of Mary's dead body to look at the mirror.} All right let's start looking.

{They split up and walk around the store and we see a flashing light that seems to be part of an alarm.}

DEAN
Maybe they've already sold it.

{SAM's flashlight stops on the mirror.}

SAM
I don't think so.

{DEAN walks over to him and pulls out the picture again to compare. It is the mirror.}

DEAN
That's it. {sighs} You sure about this? {SAM hands DEAN the flashlight.}

SAM
{sighs} Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. {he looks at DEAN who gives him an unsure look back. SAM picks up the crowbar} Bloody Mary.

{COMMERCIAL}

{DEAN turns to see a light coming through the store.}

DEAN
I'll go check that out. Stay here, be careful. {SAM readies the crowbar again} Smash anything that moves. {DEAN crawls away towards the front door. He sees a headlight.} Crap. {He puts the crowbar down and begins to walk to the door.}

{Meanwhile SAM hears a breath, so he turns to look at a different mirror, when the camera turns back to Mary's we see her in it.}

{Cut scene back to DEAN who is now outside facing police.}

Police
Hold it.

DEAN
Whoa guys, false alarm, I tripped the system.

Police
Who are you?

DEAN
I'm the boss's kid.

Police
You're Mister Yamashiro's kid?

{Cut scene back to SAM. We see Mary in a different mirror now. SAM sees her there out of the corner of his eye and smashes the mirror with the crowbar. She is in a different one now, and he sees her and smashes that mirror too. He is now back facing her mirror.}

SAM
Come on. Come into this one.

{SAM looks oddly at his reflection, which has now taken a mind of its own like Jill's. SAM starts having trouble breathing and has a trickle of blood coming out of his eye. He drops the crowbar and grabs his heart.}

Reflection
It's your fault. You killed her. You killed Jessica.

{Cut back to DEAN outside.}

DEAN
Like I said, I was adopted.

Police
Yeah.

DEAN
{Is being covered back and front by the two cops.} You know, I just—I really don't have time for this right now. {He punches one cop, backhands the other, then punches the cop in front of him again. They are now on the ground.

{Cut scene to SAM and his reflection.}

Reflection
You never told her the truth—who you really were. {SAM is now falling towards the ground.} But it's more than that, isn't it? Those nightmares you've been having of Jessica dying, screaming, burning—You had them for days before she died. Didn't you!?! You were so desperate to ignore them, to believe they were just dreams. How could you ignore them like that? How could you leave her alone to die!?! You dreamt it would happen!!!

{DEAN's crowbar goes through the mirror.}

DEAN
{bends down to the floor to SAM} SAM, SAMmy!

SAM
It's SAM.

DEAN
[in reference to the blood that had come out of his eyes] God, are you okay?

SAM
Uh, yeah.

DEAN
Come on, come on. {He pulls SAM up. He puts SAM's arm over his neck, and they begin to walk out, until Mary (again, much like SAMara coming out of the TV in The Ring) comes out of the frame of the mirror. They turn around to see her crawling over the broken glass. May walks towards them and they both fall to the ground. They both start bleeding from the face, but DEAN reaches up and pulls over a mirror so that Mary is forced to see her own reflection.}

Reflection
You killed them! All those people! You killed them!

{Mary starts choking to death and melts into a pile of blood. DEAN throws down the mirror he held and it shatters.}

DEAN
Hey SAM?

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
This has got to be like...what? 600 years of bad luck?

{SAM chuckles weakly.}

{COMMERCIAL}

{We come back to SAM and DEAN driving in the car with Charlie in the back. They pull up in front of a house.}

Charlie
So this is really over?

DEAN
{nods} Yeah, it's over.

Charlie
Thank you. {DEAN reaches back to shake her hand, and she gets out of the car.}

SAM
Charlie? {Charlie turns around} Your boyfriend's death...you really should try to forgive yourself. No matter what you did, you probably couldn't have stopped it. Sometimes bad things just happen.

{Charlie smiles faintly, then turns around to go into the house.}

DEAN
{Gently hits SAM} That's good advice. {They drive off} Hey SAM?

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
Now that this is all over, I want you to tell me what that secret is.

SAM
Look...you're my brother and I'd die for you, but there are some things I need to keep to myself. {SAM looks out the window and sees Jessica in a white dress on the street corner standing next to a light pole, as they turn the corner she disappears behind the pole, and we don't see her again.}
