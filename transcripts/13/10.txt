TEASER
IOWA
[INTERIOR – HOUSE – NIGHT]
[A man sits at a table, sharpening a knife looking at something, the camera pans around and a young girl AMANDA is seen with her hands tied cowering in the corner. Another man ED approaches the terrified girl. A post van is seen moving along a road. ED crouches in front of AMANDA]
ED
Wanna hear a joke?
MAN
Ed, don’t play with your damn food.
ED
Knock knock? Come on, girly, I said knock knock?
GIRL
Who’s there.
[ED’S face morphs into a werewolf’s and he snarls at AMANDA. She screams]
MAN
Hey!
ED
Haha!
[The sound of a vehicle can be heard outside the house, and headlights shine through the boarded up windows as the vehicle stops outside. The man at the table’s eyes constrict, showing he is a werewolf as well. ED glances at the other man and then walks towards the door. Footsteps are heard and then two distinct knocks.]
ED
Who’s there?
CLAIRE (from outside)
Delivery.
[ED opens the door.]
ED
I think you got the wrong house.
CLAIRE
Huh? Your name is right on the box.
[ED reaches for the parcel; it is addressed to Mr Werewolf.]
ED
You hunter bitch!
[CLAIRE shoots ED with the gun she’s holding behind the box and walks into the house. The other werewolf throws his knife at her and then takes cover behind an overturned table. CLAIRE dodges the knife and shoots at the table. He gets up and runs out of sight.]
CLAIRE
Amanda Fitzmartin? I’ll be right there.
[CLAIRE reloads her shotgun and looks for the other werewolf. A door creaks open and when she turns around he attacks her, knocking her to the ground. They struggle.]
MAN
Who the hell do you think you are?
[CLAIRE breaks his nose and gains the upper hand; she pulls out a knife from her boot and stabs him.]
CLAIRE
I kill monsters. That’s who the hell I am.
[CLAIRE walks over to AMANDA, her lip is cut and bleeding.]
CLAIRE
Your mother’s been looking for you. It’s going to be okay.
[As CLAIRE undoes AMANDA’S bonds, she suddenly looks terrified. There is a female werewolf standing over the dead body. CLAIRE turns around and shoots her through the heart.]
CLAIRE
Like I said, totally okay.
[EXTERIOR – AMANDA’S HOUSE – DAY]
[CLAIRE is sitting in her car, watching AMANDA reunite with her mother at the front of the house. The mother mouths a thank you to CLAIRE and she acknowledges. Her phone rings, showing caller id JODY MILLS and she answers.]
CLAIRE
Hi Jody.
JODY
Hi. Claire, it’s Sam and Dean, they’re missing.
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[SAM and DEAN are standing in a depression that appears to be a giant talon print.]
DEAN
Where the hell are we?
[INTERIOR – JODY’S HOUSE – DAY]
JODY (on the phone with CLAIRE)
They were on a hunting trip and I haven’t heard from them in a few days. It’s time to come home.
[TITLE CARD]
ACT ONE
[EXTERIOR – ROAD – DAY]
[CLAIRE is driving down to Sioux Falls. She pulls up at JODY’S house.]
[INTERIOR – JODY’S HOUSE – DAY]
[ALEX and JODY are at the dining table.]
ALEX
Tried Donna, Walt, nobody’s heard anything.
[The sound of a door opening. JODY and ALEX get up.]
CLAIRE
Surprise. Hi Jody. Alex, you miss me?
ALEX
Not really.
[ALEX smiles. JODY gestures to CLAIRE’S cut lip questioningly.]
CLAIRE
Oh it’s just a werewolf, no big deal.
[JODY hugs CLAIRE.]
CLAIRE
Wow, when did we become huggers?
[JODY releases CLAIRE. PATIENCE walks in to the room.]
JODY
I’m just glad you made it home safe. There’s somebody I want you to meet. This is uh, this is Patience.
CLAIRE
Hi.
PATIENCE
Hi.
JODY
Patience drove up from Atlanta; she’s been staying with us for a few days.
CLAIRE
Are you a hunter?
PATIENCE
Psychic.
CLAIRE
Cool. You’re wearing my sweatshirt.
PATIENCE
Uh, Jody…
CLAIRE
Is she sleeping in my room too?
JODY
Actually, the guest room is storage now. So…
CLAIRE
It’s fine; I’m the one who left.
[There are a few seconds of tense silence.]
CLAIRE
So, Sam and Dean, what do we know?
[JODY gives PATIENCE an exasperated look.]
[INTERIOR – JODY’S LIVING ROOM – DAY]
SAM (from a voicemail on the phone)
Hey Jody, thanks for your help earlier. So listen, we’re looking for someone, Kaia Nieves. She might be the key to saving Mom. So if you hear anything…
DEAN
Gotta go, call you later.
[ALEX is cleaning the cut on CLAIRE’S face. JODY and PATIENCE are seated opposite them. CLAIRE swats ALEX’S hand away.]
CLAIRE
Ow.
ALEX
Baby.
JODY
That was three days ago, I haven’t heard anything since.
CLAIRE
What about the girl? Kaia?
[EXTERIOR – ROADSIDE – NIGHT]
[KAIA NIEVES is passed out on the road. A car stops near her.]
[INTERIOR – JODY’S LIVING ROOM – NIGHT]
[CLAIRE looks at a rap sheet with KAIA’S details.]
JODY
Yeah I ran her name through the system, she was picked up for possession in Minnesota and then she escaped from court ordered drug rehab three days ago. Warrant out for arrest.
CLAIRE
Check the rehab centre and the local hospitals.
ALEX
Already did.
[EXTERIOR – ROADSIDE – NIGHT]
[The man in the car pulls out a phone.]
PHONE CALL
911, what is the nature of your emergency?
[INTERIOR – JODY’S LIVING ROOM – NIGHT]
ALEX
You going to be okay?
JODY
Yeah.
ALEX
Alright.
[ALEX gets up and walks towards the door.]
CLAIRE
Where are you going?
ALEX
Night shift.
CLAIRE
So Sam and Dean are missing and you’re bailing?
ALEX
I have a job, Claire.
CLAIRE
Huh. So do I, it’s called hunting.
[ALEX looks harried. She glances at JODY.]
ALEX (leaving)
Good luck.
CLAIRE
What is she talking about? Hmm?
JODY
Claire.
CLAIRE
If this is about me hunting alone, I know I should’ve called more, but I’m fine. I’m good! I’m safe.
JODY
No, you’re not! Patience had a vision, that’s why she’s here.
PATIENCE
I… I saw you die.
[We see a flashback of PATIENCE’S vision. It is set in THE BAD PLACE, we see forest, a gigantic claw, a spear piercing a body and an unconscious CLAIRE in JODY’S arms.]
JODY
Claire, she’s the real deal.
CLAIRE
So every vision you have, it always comes true?
PATIENCE
I don’t know. I’m still figuring all this out.
CLAIRE
So you might be wrong.
JODY
Claire this is serious, I’m trying to protect you!
CLAIRE
Jody, that’s always your excuse. Every time we’d go out on a hunt together you’d take care of the monster while I’d just wait in the car.
JODY
That happened one time!
CLAIRE
It happened every time, Jody! You, you’ve never even seen what I can do.
JODY
Claire, if I put the brakes on you it’s because you can’t go dive bombing into every fight…
CLAIRE
Yes I can! That’s how you save people. Sitting back and making the perfect plan, losing time, that’s how people end up dead.
JODY
And if you end up dead?
[Both of them are now standing. JODY is visibly upset.]
CLAIRE
I won’t.
JODY
Claire, you can’t just run away from this.
CLAIRE
Watch me.
[CLAIRE grabs her jacket and leaves the room. The mood in the room is sombre.]
[EXTERIOR – ROADSIDE – NIGHT]
[KAIA is being loaded into an ambulance. Something is watching her, making an ominous ticking noise.]
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL – NIGHT]
DOCTOR
The patient in Room Eleven’s been released; the room needs to be sanitised.
ALEX
Already done and I processed her discharge paperwork.
DOCTOR
Well done.
[The doctor hands over a form to ALEX and walks away. CLAIRE is waiting at the reception area.]
CLAIRE
Nice outfit.
ALEX
It’s a uniform, what’s your excuse?
CLAIRE
I look great.
ALEX
You look like Biker Barbie.
CLAIRE
Thank you.
[ALEX moves behind the counter still concentrating on the form she’s filling.]
CLAIRE
You knew? About the whole vision thing?
ALEX
Yup and I knew how you’d react.
CLARIE
So, you have a job but you still help Jody with cases, I thought you wanted out of the whole monster thing.
ALEX
If she needs my help with anything, the dishes, monsters, I’m there, for her.
CLAIRE
Unlike me. Alex, the way things were going, if I’d stuck around, she just would’ve worried all the time.
ALEX
Claire, she never stopped. Anyway, I’m guessing you didn’t crash my job for a heart to heart. What do you want?
CLAIRE
Two minutes in your system?
ALEX
Told you, I already checked.
CLAIRE (moving to behind ALEX and the computer)
Well did you run rock star aliases?
ALEX
From metal gods to obscure hair bands, nothing.
CLAIRE
Hey, how about the girl Kaia?
ALEX
Yes.
CLAIRE
Did you try Jane Does?
ALEX
I did. But, an identified woman was just brought in.
CLAIRE
Where?
ALEX
Here.
[INTERIOR – HOSPITAL CORRIDOR – NIGHT]
[CLAIRE is looking into room that has KAIA in it. She’s being attended by the DOCTOR]
DOCTOR
So your vital signs are stable and your concussion is minor but we’re going to need to keep you here under observation.
[KAIA notices CLAIRE through the blinds and they make eye contact. The DOCTOR leaves and KAIA immediately pulls out her IV drip and grabs her clothes.]
CLAIRE
Where you going? Hey I get it, if I had the cops on my ass I’d be racing out of Dodge too.
KAIA
Who are you?
CLAIRE
I’m a friend of Sam and Dean Winchester and I think you know them too.
KAIA
Leave me alone.
CLAIRE
Hey!
[KAIA runs out of the room, pulling a table behind her to block CLAIRE. She exits the back of the hospital and is stopped by a hideous monster, the same one that was watching when she was being loaded into the ambulance. Its ominous clicking can be heard. CLAIRE bursts out of the door and notices the monster. She pulls out her knife and stabs it in the shoulder; it retaliates and throws her against nearby garbage bins. The monster advances towards KAIA when JODY shoots it in the leg. CLAIRE jumps up and stabs it under its chin causing blue goo to erupt from its neck. CLAIRE retrieves her knife and looks at a terrified KAIA.]
CLAIRE
So let’s talk.
ACT TWO
[INTERIOR – JODY’S GARAGE – NIGHT]
[JODY and ALEX wheel the body of the monster into the garage. ALEX unzips the bag and the masked monster is revealed.]
PATIENCE
Ugh, dude.
JODY
What’s under the mask?
ALEX (snapping on a pair of gloves)
Let’s find out.
[EXTERIOR – JODY’S HOUSE – NIGHT]
[KAIA is sitting alone, lost in thought. CLAIRE comes up and sits next to her.]
CLAIRE
See one of those things before huh?
KAIA
In my dreams and not just one of them, those things they – they travel in packs. They pick up your scent and they don’t stop.
CLAIRE
So you fight them?
KAIA
Fight? No, I run, but sometimes they catch me.
CLAIRE
Is that how you got that?
[CLAIRE indicates the scars of KAIA’S wrist. She nods.]
KAIA
I’ve got others, all over.
CLAIRE
Me too. Look, ghoul bite. Bar fight with a vampire, he threw me through a window.
[CLAIRE unzips the bottom of her pant leg to show her the scar and then indicates her shoulder. KAIA looks reassured. She touches CLAIRE’S head.]
KAIA
And this one?
CLAIRE
Umm, heroic battle with the doorknob. I tripped.
[KAIA chuckles. CLAIRE smiles.]
CLAIRE
Kaia, what happened?
[INTERIOR – JODY’S GARAGE – NIGHT]
[ALEX removes the monster’s mask to reveal a disgusting slime-covered alien face.]
PATIENCE
Oh god.
ALEX
Don’t scream.
PATIENCE
Might puke.
[CLAIRE and KAIA enter the garage.]
PATIENCE
What is that?
JODY
I don’t know.
CLAIRE (looking at KAIA)
She does. It’s okay, you can tell.
KAIA
Umm I’m a dreamwalker. It means when I sleep I see another world, this other dimension.
PATIENCE
Seriously?
KAIA
The Bad Place, it’s where that came from. Your friends, Sam and Dean, they wanted me to help them open a door to another world and we did but something went wrong.
JODY
Okay so then how did this thing end up here?
CLAIRE
The door is still open. If we find it we find Sam and Dean.
KAIA
No. If they’re there, they’re already dead.
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[SAM and DEAN are sitting at a fire, roasting lizards. DEAN picks off a piece of flesh, appraises and eats it. He looks at SAM, who looks disgusted.]
SAM
No no no, don’t tell me it tastes like chicken.
DEAN
No, Sam it’s a lizard. It tastes like a lizard.
SAM
You know we really gotta get moving, keep looking for that door.
DEAN
Yeah, if there is a door.
SAM
Well last time we opened one, it stayed open.
DEAN
Yeah, for a few hours. We’ve been here for what, two days, in change? I mean look, man, I hope you’re right, I really do, but if you’re not and we’re stuck here in this freaking monster land? I mean, nobody back home even knows where to start looking for us.
SAM
So what are you saying?
DEAN
I’m saying, eat up.
[SAM makes a face. In the distance the sound of something growling and stomping is heard.]
DEAN
That sound closer to you?
SAM
Yeah. What do you think it is?
DEAN
Let’s not find out.
[DEAN sticks the skewer with meat into the ground and they both get up to leave. As SAM jogs away DEAN hurries back and retrieves the stick with the meat, eating it as he follows SAM. The sounds of footsteps is louder and a cloaked and hooded figure wielding a spear is seen watching SAM and DEAN walk away.]
[INTERIOR – JODY’S HOUSE – NIGHT]
[PATIENCE is packing her bags, ALEX walks into the room.]
ALEX
So, you’re leaving?
PATIENCE
If I go now, maybe my dad will take me back.
ALEX
Is that what you want? To go back home, pretend you’re little Miss Perfect and not a powerful psychic?
PATIENCE
This is just all way too freaky. I mean, your mom’s out burying a monster in the backyard.
ALEX
Well you gotta bury him somewhere.
PATIENCE
I came here to tell Jody about my vision and Claire just blew it off. And I am not a fighter, I couldn’t even imagine going up against one of those things.
ALEX
You don’t have to be a fighter; I’m not, not really. No, we help in other ways.
PATIENCE
I’m sorry, I can’t do this.
[PATIENCE zips up her bag and walks out. She is seen walking to her car and unlocking it. As she opens the trunk she is hit with a vision and she drops the bag in shock. In the vision she sees the monsters from The Bad Place breaking into JODY’S house. She returns to the house and barges into the living room, where KAIA and CLAIRE are sitting.]
PATIENCE
We have to go. Now.
CLAIRE
What?
PATIENCE
Those monsters? They’re coming, lots of them.
KAIA
They’re after me.
CLAIRE
Then we should stay and fight.
PATIENCE
There’s too many, they’ll kill us.
CLAIRE
Maybe, maybe not.
PATIENCE
Look, I gave up a lot to come here. To do what was right, to save you. You want to brush that off? You want to think I’m a fake, fine. But I’m telling you right now we’re all in danger.
KAIA
Claire…
[The monsters break into the house through the windows just as in PATIENCE’S vision, and wreak havoc on the house. A webcam has been set up through which CLAIRE and KAIA are watching the mayhem in shock. They are in PATIENCE’S car driving away from the house.]
PATIENCE
You believe me now?
ACT TWO
[EXTERIOR – LAKESIDE – DAY]
[The two cars pull up near a pier and all the girls disembark.]
KAIA
Why are we stopping?
JODY
We’re taking a breather. I called in some backup.
PATIENCE
Like what, the National Guard?
JODY
Oh, better.
[A car honks and drives into the clearing, bearing the license plate D-TRAIN. DONNA HANSCUM exits the car and smiles widely.]
DONNA
Hiya ladies.
ALEX
Hey Donna.
[ALEX has gone to hug DONNA and she indicates CLAIRE to join in.]
DONNA
Okay, you too Rainbow Bright, come on bring it in.
JODY
Patience, Kaia, this is Sheriff Donna Hanscum. She’s uh, she’s killed a lot of vampires.
DONNA
Well, you know, I do what I do. Anyhoo, brought the basics.
[DONNA opens the trunk of her car and pulls out a box filled with guns and knives.]
PATIENCE
Why do you have all this?
DONNA
I’m from Minnesota.
JODY
Kaia, where were you when this went down with Sam and Dean?
KAIA (we see the flashback)
I don’t know, we were heading west out of Mankato towards Sioux Falls.
DONNA
So Route 14?
KAIA
We got run off the road. We pulled into an abandoned boatyard, I didn’t see a sign.
ALEX
There’s a Larsen Brothers shipyard just off Route 14, shut down in ’08.
JODY (to DONNA)
We’ll check it out?
DONNA
Yeah.
JODY
Claire, come here.
[JODY and CLAIRE walk away.]
DONNA
So, who knows how to use a flamethrower?
JODY
Claire, I know you’re not going to like this but I need you to stay here to keep Kaia and the girls safe. Just until we’ve checked things out, okay?
CLAIRE
Okay Jody. Go.
[JODY looks surprised at CLAIRE’S agreement.]
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[SAM and DEAN are walking in the forest.]
SAM
Look Dean, I don’t think this is just a different world, I think it’s a different universe.
DEAN
Yeah well, this universe sucks.
SAM
Yeah.
[They stop for a minute as DEAN tries to remove something stuck to his boot. They both straighten up when they hear a noise.]
DEAN
What was that?
[The cloaked figure from before is seen behind the boys. It attacks them viciously with the spear, knocking them both out with remarkable marksmanship.]
[EXTERIOR – LARSEN BROTHERS SHIPYARD – DAY]
[DONNA and JODY look at the scene from their car. DONNA is looking through binoculars.]
JODY
You think this is the place?
DONNA
Oh yeah, you betcha.
[The two walk down the path into the abandoned ship. They see a melted angel blade stuck to the floor as they walk in with their guns extended. They notice a glowing room at a higher level.]
[EXTERIOR – LAKESIDE – DAY]
[CLAIRE is pensively sitting in the open truck of a car. KAIA walks over to her.]
KAIA
Room over there?
[KAIA sits in the trunk next to CLAIRE, both of them looking out at the view. KAIA turns to appraise CLAIRE.]
KAIA
You’re scared.
CLAIRE
Yeah. Jody always said I’d get myself killed, hunting, and I’d be like, good. If I’m going to go out then that’s how I want to do it, doing something great. But Patience’s vision… It’s one thing thinking that you’re going to die but actually knowing it? For once a part of me kinda just wants to sit back and let Jody handle it, you know? Stay safe. But Sam and Dean saved my life and I can’t sit this one out.
KAIA
Then don’t. If you go, I’ll go with you. Maybe together we can save them.
[INTERIOR – ABANDONED SHIP – DAY]
[DONNA and JODY have found the gate to the other dimension. It is a glowing rift hanging in space.]
DONNA
Oofta, there it is.
[JODY holsters her gun and reaches for the gate.]
DONNA
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we’re going to go back, right? Going to tell the girls?
JODY
I’m going in.
DONNA
What now?
JODY
If I don’t, she will. Donna, I cannot lose another child.
[As JODY approaches the rift, clicking noises from the monsters can be heard.]
DONNA
Jody.
[DONNA and JODY slowly case out the corridors and come across two of the monsters. They quickly take cover against a wall.]
DONNA
Jeez! Is that a umm?
JODY
Yup.
[The monsters run to another room. DONNA and JODY are making their way to the exit. They are spotted by two of the monsters and shoot at them before running for cover.]
JODY
Come on!
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[SAM and DEAN are tied to trees. SAM is unconscious.]
DEAN
Sam, Sammy! Hey.
SAM
What happened?
[SAM wakes and struggles. The cloaked figure appears in their line of sight, standing next to the giant skull from PATIENCE’S vision.]
DEAN
Hey yo! Darth Dickwad!
[The figure uses its spear to bang on the skull thrice and then walks away.]
DEAN
The hell?
SAM
What was that all about?
[The ominous growling can be heard again in the background. DEAN looks around and notices the skeletons of many animals scattered around them. Realization strikes him.]
DEAN
I think it just rang the dinner bell.
[EXTERIOR – LAKESIDE – DAY]
[ALEX and PATIENCE are standing near the lake, CLAIRE and KAIA walk up to them.]
CLAIRE
Patience, give me your keys. Jody’s not picking up her phone. Something’s wrong.
[INTERIOR – ABANDONED SHIP – DAY]
[DONNA and JODY are trapped in a car, the monsters circling them.]
DONNA
If we make a run for the truck, we’re dead.
JODY
If we stay here we’re dead.
DONNA
Alrighty then.
[Suddenly there is a loud noise and one of the monsters lands on the top of the car. DONNA shoots through the roof. Another monster charges the window of the car and before JODY can shoot it, it is engulfed in flames. JODY and DONNA get out of the car to see the four girls standing outside, CLAIRE holding a flamethrower. ]
CLAIRE
I called, you didn’t answer. We worried.
DONNA
Where’s the other one?
PATIENCE
There’s another one?
CLAIRE
It probably bolted.
[CLAIRE puts the flamethrower down. She notices the glowing light indicating the gate. She runs towards it.]
CLAIRE
Is that the door?
JODY
Claire. Claire! Claire, please wait! Oh hell.
[CLAIRE, KAIA and JODY have run up to the gate. It is visibly diminished.]
KAIA
What?
JODY
It’s getting smaller, it’s closing.
[CLAIRE reaches for the gate.]
JODY
No Claire wait!
CLAIRE
Jody, I know you’re trying to protect me, but I need to save Sam and Dean and you have to let me.
JODY
I know.
[Downstairs, DONNA and ALEX are loading bullets into gun.]
DONNA
You ever shot a gun before?
PATIENCE
No.
DONNA
Okey-doke, here you go. Aim in their general direction, relax and squeeze. Squeeze, don’t pull.
[The monster can be heard, clicking. DONNA takes aim in his direction.]
DONNA
Oh there he is. Hiya buddy.
[Before DONNA can shoot at least six more monsters appear, advancing in their direction.]
DONNA
Upstairs. Move.
[ALEX and PATIENCE run upstairs and DONNA starts to shoot.]
DONNA (from the stairwell)
Jody! A little help. Jody!
[CLAIRE and JODY are still staring at each other. DONNA, ALEX and PATIENCE are shooting at the monsters on the stairwell, Donna calling for help. JODY tilts her head at CLAIRE and gives in.]
JODY
Go.
[CLAIRE looks at KAIA who looks afraid.]
CLAIRE
I’ll protect you.
[She takes her hand and moves towards the gate.]
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[CLAIRE and KAIA have come through the gate.]
CLAIRE
Are you okay?
KAIA
Yeah. This way.
[The roaring and footsteps can be heard in the distance. KAIA grabs CLAIRE’S hand they run.]
[INTERIOR – ABANDONED SHIP – DAY]
[DONNA, ALEX and PATIENCE are still shooting the monsters on the stairs. ALEX and PATIENCE grab a cabinet of some sort and throw it down the stairs, blocking the monsters.]
PATIENCE
Come on!
[JODY joins the group and they all run to another room.]
DONNA
They’re gone?
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[DEAN is struggling against his bonds as the sound of roaring and footsteps gets nearer.]
DEAN
Ugh, damnit!
SAM
Dean, you hear that?
[CLAIRE cuts through DEAN’S bonds and appears in his line of sight. KAIA does the same for SAM.]
DEAN
Claire?
CLAIRE
Hey boys.
DEAN
My hero.
SAM
Hey, how did you get here?
CLAIRE
It’s the door, it’s still open.
KAIA
For now.
SAM
Where’s Jack?
KAIA
I think he’s in the other place with your mom.
[The noises are closer now.]
CLAIRE
It’s time to go.
SAM
Yeah we gotta go. Go go go.
[INTERIOR – ABANDONED SHIP – DAY]
[The women enter a room cautiously. After making sure it’s clear they prepare for another assault.]
JODY
Okay, anything gets in here we take it down.
DONNA (to PATIENCE, who is looking terrified)
Hey, you got this.
[The tell-tale clicking of the monsters is heard.]
JODY
Alright girls, let’s go to work.
[As the monsters come at them, all of them start shooting, picking off their targets.]
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[SAM, DEAN, CLAIRE and KAIA are running to the gate.]
KAIA
There!
[They come to a stop around it. KAIA turns at the snap of a branch and watches the cloaked figure hurl its spear at CLAIRE. She pushes CLAIRE out of the way and gets impaled by the spear herself. The spear entering her body is exactly as seen in PATIENCE’S vision. She falls to the ground as CLAIRE looks at her in despair. SAM and DEAN immediately pull out angel blades and prepare to fight the figure.]
CLAIRE
Kaia…
[KAIA has reached out and taken CLAIRE’S hand. As she dies her hand goes limp and falls out of CLAIRE’S. Suddenly the approaching footsteps stop and SAM and DEAN look up into a gigantic monster with glowing red eyes and a face made of rock. It stands behind the cloaked figure.]
[INTERIOR – ABANDONED SHIP – DAY]
[The four women are furiously fighting the incoming monsters. ALEX shoots one multiple times before it goes down.]
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[SAM and DEAN look awestruck as they take in the giant.]
[INTERIOR – ABANDONED SHIP – DAY]
[DONNA shoots at a monster that dives behind a table for cover. JODY vaults over the table and shoots it from above.]
[EXTERIOR – THE BAD PLACE – NIGHT]
[CLAIRE has just gotten up off the ground and she is furious. She charges the cloaked figure blindly, intending to kill it. DEAN wakes up from his stupor and restrains her.]
DEAN
No no no no, Claire! Come on we’ve gotta go!
SAM
Go go! Go go go!
[The giant roars showing huge teeth. The three of them pass through the gate which disappears behind them.]
[INTERIOR – ABANDONED SHIP – DAY]
[A monster runs at PATIENCE who shoots it down. She looks shocked as it falls dead. There is a loud noise and SAM, DEAN and CLAIRE reappear through the gate, CLAIRE falling down in despair. The gate disappears behind them.]
CLAIRE
No!
[JODY comes running into the room, holstering her gun and dropping down to cradle CLAIRE who is now crying. The other women come in as well. JODY gives SAM and DEAN a questioning glance, to which SAM shakes his head sadly. CLAIRE is crying wholeheartedly now and in THE BAD PLACE we see KAIA’S body with the spear still through her. PATIENCE recognizes the scene of JODY holding CLAIRE as the one from her vision, but now she understands that CLAIRE was not dead, simply sad.]
[EXTERIOR – JODY’S HOUSE –DAY]
[ALEX and PATIENCE are putting away supplies. SAM and DEAN are leaving, JODY walking with them.]
SAM (to ALEX and PATIENCE)
Bye guys.
DEAN
You know, I tried talking to her.
SAM
Yeah, she’s uh, she seems pretty shut down.
JODY
Claire’s going to need a lot of time.
SAM
Well, um, when she is ready to hear it…
DEAN
You tell her thank you from us.
SAM
Jody, that rift was open for a while; more of those things may have come through.
DEAN
Now we’ve seen some freaks, but over there it’s a whole new world of bad.
JODY
We will handle it. Come on, you guys take care of the world. We got Sioux Falls covered.
DEAN
Damn right you do.
[DEAN and SAM hug JODY and then get into the car. They drive off while waving bye to JODY.]
JODY
Bye!
[INTERIOR – CLAIRE’S ROOM – DAY]
JODY
Hey. Claire…
CLAIRE
You were right.
JODY
No, this isn’t on you, not all of it, I told you to go.
CLAIRE
No. I didn’t even think, I just raced in, no plan. I said I’d protect her. I get it now, why you are the way you are, with me. Because of the… this feeling…
JODY
You don’t have to do this alone. When you’re ready, if you want, we’re all here for you.
[INTERIOR – JODY’S LIVING ROOM – DAY]
[DONNA, ALEX and PATIENCE are clearing up, removing the glass and fixing broken furniture.]
PATIENCE
I killed a monster.
[DONNA and ALEX exchange a knowing smile and giggle.]
PATIENCE
What?
ALEX
Welcome to the family.
[JODY walks into the room, she gives them a reassuring nod. In Claire’s room, she takes out her diary and starts writing. We hear her monologue. Downstairs in the house, the four women are sitting at the dining table and eating dinner. CLAIRE joins them.]
CLAIRE
I came back to Sioux Falls to save Sam and Dean Winchester and I did. No, we did, we saved Sam and Dean. All of these amazing women, my family. They don’t know it yet, they think I’m staying because I’m broken but I’m staying because I need them, my family, my army. The thing that killed Kaia is still out there and I don’t care if I have to tear another hole in the universe, we’re going to find it. And I’m going to kill it.
[In a distant park, there is a sudden flash of light and another gate is opened. The cloaked figure from The Bad Place comes through it and takes off the hood to reveal itself to be none other than KAIA herself. She smiles.]
