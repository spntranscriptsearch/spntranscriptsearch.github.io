EXT. CARLTON HOUSE – DAY

INT. CARLTON HOUSE – DAY

WILL CARLTON sits on the kitchen counter eating cereal, BILL CARLTON at the table reading the newspaper. SOPHIE CARLTON comes through the room.

SOPHIE kisses her father on the cheek.

SOPHIE
Morning, Daddy.

BILL
Morning, sweetheart.

SOPHIE goes to get something out of the refrigerator.

WILL
All these workouts, Soph, I don't know. Guys don't like buff girls.

SOPHIE
Yeah, well, girls don't like guys who still live at home.

WILL drains the milk from his cereal bowl and slides off the counter.

WILL
Ha ha ha.

SOPHIE
Ha ha.

SOPHIE opens the door to leave.

BILL
Be careful.

SOPHIE
I will.

SOPHIE closes the door.

EXT. LAKE – DAY

SOPHIE stands on the dock, looking at the lake. WILL watches from a distance as she dives in. She swims and comes up for air, looking around; she sees no one. She keeps swimming. She comes up for air again and looks around some more; still no one. SOMEONE approaches her from underwater and pulls her under. Bubbles. Nothing.

ACT ONE
RESTAURANT
EXT. MOTEL – DAY

A truck goes past a neon sign that says HOTEL, behind a building that says THE Lynnwood INN. The Impala is parked in front.

INT. RESTAURANT – DAY

There is a mostly empty plate in front of DEAN, who is circling obituaries in a newspaper.

Starring
JARED PADALECKI

JENSEN ACKLES

DEAN circles an obituary that reads:

CARLTON, SOPHIE -The Carlton family is sad to announce the death of their beloved daughter in a tragic swimming accident. Sophie Carlton, 18, was having her [...] Lake Manitoc WI, an [...] suddenly [...]

An attractive WAITRESS, whose nametag says WENDY, approaches.

WENDY
Can I get you anything else?

DEAN looks up and grins around the pen he's chewing on.

SAM comes over and sits down.

SAM
Just the check, please.

WENDY
Okay.

WENDY walks away. DEAN drops his head, then looks at SAM.

DEAN
You know, Sam, we are allowed to have fun once in a while.

DEAN points to WENDY walking away; she's wearing short shorts.

DEAN
That's fun.

SAM looks at him. DEAN hands SAM the newspaper.

DEAN
Here, take a look at this, I think I got one. Lake Manitoc, Wisconsin. Last week Sophie Carlton, eighteen, walks into the lake, doesn't walk out. Authorities dragged the water; nothing. Sophie Carlton is the third Lake Manitoc drowning this year. None of the other bodies were found either. They had a funeral two days ago.

SAM
A funeral?

DEAN
Yeah, it's weird, they buried an empty coffin. For, uh, closure or whatever.

AMY ACKER

SAM
Closure? What closure? People don't just disappear, Dean. Other people just stop looking for them.

DANIEL HUGH KELLY

DEAN
Something you want to say to me?

SAM
The trail for Dad. It's getting colder every day.

DEAN
Exactly. So what are we supposed to do?

SAM
I don't know. Something. Anything.

DEAN
You know what? I'm sick of this attitude. You don't think I wanna find Dad as much as you do?

SAM
Yeah, I know you do, it's just—

DEAN
I'm the one that's been with him every single day for the past two years, while you've been off to college going to pep rallies. We will find Dad, but until then, we're gonna kill everything bad between here and there. Okay?

SAM rolls his eyes. WENDY walks by, distracting DEAN.

EXT. LAKE – DAY

BILL CARLTON is sitting on a bench on the dock. WILL brings SAM and DEAN around to see him.

Created by
ERIC KRIPKE

WILL
She was about a hundred yards out.

Written by
SERA GAMBLE
&
RAELLE TUCKER

WILL
That's where she got dragged down.

DEAN
And you're sure she didn't just drown?

WILL
Yeah. She was a varsity swimmer.

Directed by
KIM MANNERS

WILL
She practically grew up in that lake. She was as safe out there as in her own bathtub.

SAM
So no splashing? No signs of distress?

WILL
No, that's what I'm telling you.

SAM
Did you see any shadows in the water? Maybe some dark shape breach the surface?

WILL
No. Again, she was really far out there.

DEAN
You ever see any strange tracks by the shoreline?

WILL
No, never. Why? Why, what do you think's out there?

DEAN
We'll let you know as soon as we do.

DEAN heads back to the car.

SAM
What about your father?

DEAN stops and turns back.

SAM
Can we talk to him?

WILL turns to look at BILL, then turns back.

WILL
Look, if you don't mind, I mean...he didn't see anything and he's kind of been through a lot.

SAM
We understand.

SAM and DEAN go to the car.

POLICE STATION
INT. POLICE STATION – DAY

SHERIFF JAKE DEVINS talks to SAM and DEAN.

JAKE
Now, I'm sorry, but why does the Wildlife Service care about an accidental drowning?

SAM
You sure it's accidental? Will Carlton saw something grab his sister.

JAKE
Like what?

They walk into JAKE's office. JAKE motions to chairs in front of his desk.

JAKE
Here, sit, please. There are no indigenous carnivores in that lake.

SAM and DEAN sit.

JAKE
There's nothing even big enough to pull down a person, unless it was the Loch Ness Monster.

DEAN
Yeah.

He laughs.

DEAN
Right.

SAM glances at DEAN.

JAKE
Will Carlton was traumatized, and sometimes the mind plays tricks. Still—

JAKE sits down.

JAKE
We dragged that entire lake. We even ran a sonar sweep, just to be sure, and there was nothing down there.

DEAN
That's weird, though, I mean, that's, that's the third missing body this year.

JAKE
I know. These are people from my town. These are people I care about.

DEAN
I know.

JAKE
Anyway...

JAKE sighs.

JAKE
All this...it won't be a problem much longer.

DEAN
What do you mean?

JAKE
Well, the dam, of course.

DEAN
Of course, the dam. It's, uh, it sprung a leak.

JAKE
It's falling apart, and the feds won't give us the grant to repair it, so they've opened the spillway. In another six months, there won't be much of a lake. There won't be much of a town, either. But as Federal Wildlife, you already knew that.

DEAN
Exactly.

A YOUNG WOMAN, ANDREA BARR, taps on the door.

ANDREA
Sorry, am I interrupting?

SAM and DEAN stand up.

ANDREA
I can come back later.

JAKE
Gentlemen, this is my daughter.

DEAN
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dean.

DEAN shakes ANDREA's hand.

ANDREA
Andrea Barr. Hi.

DEAN
Hi.

JAKE
They're from the Wildlife Service. About the lake.

ANDREA
Oh.

A BOY, LUCAS BARR, walks in around ANDREA.

DEAN
Oh, hey there. What's your name?

LUCAS walks away without speaking. ANDREA follows.

JAKE
His name is Lucas.

LUCAS and ANDREA are in the main room. ANDREA gives him some crayons out of a box.

SAM
Is he okay?

JAKE
My grandson's been through a lot. We all have.

JAKE stands and goes to the office door.

JAKE
Well, if there's anything else I can do for you, please let me know.

DEAN, SAM, and JAKE leave the office.

DEAN
Thanks. You know, now that you mentioned it, could you point us in the direction of a reasonably priced motel?

ANDREA
Lakefront Motel. Go around the corner. It's about two blocks south.

DEAN
Two—would you mind showing us?

ANDREA laughs.

ANDREA
You want me to walk you two blocks?

DEAN
Not if it's any trouble.

ANDREA
I'm headed that way anyway.

ANDREA turns to JAKE.

ANDREA
I'll be back to pick up Lucas at three.

ANDREA turns to LUCAS.

ANDREA
We'll go to the park, okay, sweetie?

ANDREA kisses LUCAS on the head.

DEAN waves as they leave. JAKE nods.

SAM
Thanks again.

STREET
EXT. STREET – DAY

ANDREA leads DEAN and SAM along the street.

DEAN
So, cute kid.

ANDREA
Thanks.

They cross a street.

DEAN
Kids are the best, huh?

ANDREA glances at him and ignores him. They keep walking. They stop in front of a building that says LAKEFRONT MOTEL.

ANDREA
There it is. Like I said, two blocks.

SAM
Thanks.

ANDREA addresses DEAN.

ANDREA
Must be hard, with your sense of direction, never being able to find your way to a decent pickup line.

ANDREA leaves, calling back over her shoulder.

ANDREA
Enjoy your stay!

SAM
'Kids are the best'? You don't even like kids.

DEAN
I love kids.

SAM
Name three children that you even know.

DEAN thinks and comes up empty. SAM waves a hand and walks into the motel. DEAN scratches his head.

DEAN
I'm thinking!

MOTEL
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

SAM is working on his laptop. DEAN is going through his clothing.

SAM
So there's the three drowning victims this year.

DEAN
Any before that?

SAM
Uh, yeah.

SAM has a browser window open to The Lake Manitoc Tribune. DROWNING TAINTS ICE FISHING FESTIVAL. He clicks, and another browser window comes up, again the Tribune: 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL DROWNS IN LAKE, Second drowning in 6 months at Lake Manitoc

SAM
Six more spread out over the past thirty-five years. Those bodies were never recovered either. If there is something out there, it's picking up its pace.

DEAN tosses an item of clothing onto a bed.

DEAN
So, what, we got a lake monster on a binge?

SAM
This whole lake monster theory, it, it just bugs me.

DEAN comes over to read over SAM's shoulder.

DEAN
Why?

SAM
Loch Ness, uh, Lake Champlain, there are literally hundreds of eyewitness accounts, but here, almost nothing.

SAM looks at the Tribune homepage.

SAM
Whatever it is out there, no one's living to talk about it.

SAM scrolls to the comments section of an article. DEAN points at it.

DEAN
Wait, Barr, Christopher Barr. Where have I heard that name before?

SAM reads from the page.

SAM
Christopher Barr, the victim in May.

SAM clicks a link, opening a new page. LOCAL MAN IN TRAGIC ACCIDENT. The picture loads: it shows a police officer with LUCAS.

SAM
Oh. Christopher Barr was Andrea's husband, Lucas's father. Apparently he took Lucas out swimming. Lucas was on a floating wooden platform when Chris drowned. Two hours before the kid got rescued.

SAM clicks the picture for a better look, then scratches his head.

SAM
Maybe we have an eyewitness after all.

DEAN
No wonder that kid was so freaked out. Watching one of your parents die isn't something you just get over.

PARK
EXT. PARK – DAY

Kids are laughing and playing. ANDREA sits on a bench and watches LUCAS, who is at another bench coloring and playing with toy soldiers.

SAM (voiceover)
Can we join you?

ANDREA looks up. SAM and DEAN are there.

ANDREA
I'm here with my son.

DEAN looks over at LUCAS.

DEAN
Oh. Mind if I say hi?

DEAN goes over to LUCAS.

ANDREA
Tell your friend this whole Jerry Maguire thing is not gonna work on me.

SAM sits next to ANDREA.

SAM
I don't think that's what this is about.

DEAN approaches LUCAS.

DEAN
How's it going?

DEAN kneels down next to the bench where LUCAS is coloring; when LUCAS doesn't even look up, DEAN picks up one of the toy soldiers.

DEAN
Oh, I used to love these things.

DEAN imitates guns and explosions, then tosses the toy soldier down.

DEAN
So crayons is more your thing? That's cool. Chicks dig artists.

LUCAS has a pile of drawings on the bench. DEAN takes a look. The top one is of a big black swirl; the second one is of a red bicycle.

DEAN
Hey, these are pretty good. You mind if I sit and draw with you for a while?

DEAN picks up a crayon.

DEAN
I'm not so bad myself.

DEAN sits on the bench, picks up a pad of paper, and starts drawing.

DEAN
You know, I'm thinking you can hear me, you just don't want to talk. I don't know exactly what happened to your dad, but I know it was something real bad. I think I know how you feel. When I was your age, I saw something.

A pause.

DEAN
Anyway. Well, maybe you don't think anyone will listen to you, or, uh...or believe you. I want you to know that I will. You don't even have to say anything. You could draw me a picture about what you saw that day, with your dad, on the lake. Okay, no problem. This is for you.

DEAN holds out to LUCAS the picture he drew. It's stick figures.

DEAN
This is my family.

DEAN points at each person in turn.

DEAN
That's my dad. That's my mom. That's my geek brother, and that's me.

A pause.

DEAN
All right, so I'm a sucky artist. I'll see you around, Lucas.

DEAN heads back to SAM and ANDREA. LUCAS picks up the picture.

DEAN approaches ANDREA and SAM.

ANDREA
Lucas hasn't said a word, not even to me. Not since his dad's accident.

DEAN
Yeah, we heard. Sorry.

ANDREA nods.

SAM
What are the doctors saying?

ANDREA
That it's a kind of post-traumatic stress.

SAM
That can't be easy. For either of you.

ANDREA
We moved in with my dad. He helps out a lot. It's just...when I think about what Lucas went through, what he saw...

A pause.

DEAN
Kids are strong. You'd be surprised what they can deal with.

LUCAS leaves the bench, heading for the group.

ANDREA
You know, he used to have such life. He was hard to keep up with, to tell you the truth. Now he just sits there. Drawing those pictures, playing with those army men. I just wish—

LUCAS walks up, carrying a picture.

ANDREA
Hey sweetie.

LUCAS hands DEAN the picture.

DEAN
Thanks. Thanks, Lucas.

It's a picture of the Carlton house.

LUCAS heads back to the bench.

CARLTON HOUSE
INT. CARLTON HOUSE – DAY

BILL is sitting in a chair, doing nothing. WILL approaches.

WILL
Hey, Dad? You, you should probably eat something. I'm gonna make some dinner, okay?

BILL says nothing and turns his head away.

INT. KITCHEN – DAY

WILL washes a fish at the sink. He does not turn the water off when he begins cutting up the fish. The water turns brown. WILL notices and shuts off the water. Black water comes up through the drain and fills the sink. WILL rolls up his sleeve to pull the plug out of the drain. He comes up with the plug, but the water doesn't drain. He sticks his arm back in the water, and something grabs it, pulling him into the sink. He drowns. The water drains.

ACT TWO
MOTEL
INT. MOTEL – DAY

DEAN is inside the motel room sitting on a bed. SAM opens the door and comes in.

SAM
So, I think it's safe to say we can rule out Nessie.

DEAN
What do you mean?

SAM sits next to DEAN.

SAM
I just drove past the Carlton house. There was an ambulance there. Will Carlton is dead.

DEAN
He drowned?

SAM
Yep. In the sink.

DEAN
What the hell? So you're right, this isn't a creature. We're dealing with something else.

SAM
Yeah, but what?

DEAN
I don't know. Water wraith, maybe? Some kind of demon? I mean, something that controls water...water that comes from the same source.

SAM
The lake.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
Which would explain why it's upping the body count. The lake is draining. It'll be dry in a few months. Whatever this thing is, whatever it wants, it's running out of time.

DEAN
And if it can get through the pipes, it can get to anyone, almost anywhere.

DEAN stands up.

DEAN
This is gonna happen again soon.

DEAN sits down on a chair.

SAM
And we do know one other thing for sure. We know this has got something to do with Bill Carlton.

DEAN
Yeah, it took both his kids.

SAM
And I've been asking around. Lucas's dad, Chris—Bill Carlton's godson.

DEAN
Let's go pay Mr. Carlton a visit.

LAKE
EXT. LAKE – DAY

BILL CARLTON is sitting on the bench on the dock.

SAM (voiceover)
Mr. Carlton?

BILL looks up. SAM and DEAN approach.

SAM
We'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

DEAN
We're from the, the Department—

BILL
I don't care who you're with. I've answered enough questions today.

SAM
Your son said he saw something in that lake. What about you? You ever see anything out there? Mr. Carlton, Sophie's drowning and Will's death—we think there might be a connection to you or your family.

BILL
My children are gone. It's...it's worse than dying. Go away. Please.

SAM and DEAN head back to the car.

SAM
What do you think?

DEAN
Aw, I think the poor guy's been through hell. I also think he's not telling us something.

SAM leans on the Impala.

SAM
So now what?

DEAN goes still.

SAM
What is it?

DEAN
Huh.

DEAN is looking at the Carlton house.

DEAN
Maybe Bill's not the only one who knows something.

DEAN pulls out the picture LUCAS brought him, which is of the Carlton house. DEAN looks at SAM.

DEVINS/BARR HOUSE
ANDREA (voiceover)
I'm sorry, but I don't think it's a good idea.

DEAN (voiceover)
I just need to talk to him.

INT. HOUSE – DAY

SAM and DEAN are inside ANDREA's house, talking to her.

DEAN
Just for a few minutes.

ANDREA
He won't say anything. What good's it gonna do?

SAM
Andrea, we think more people might get hurt. We think something's happening out there.

ANDREA
My husband, the others, they just drowned. That's all.

DEAN
If that's what you really believe, then we'll go. But if you think there's even a possibility that something else could be going on here, please let me talk to your son.

INT. LUCAS'S BEDROOM – DAY

LUCAS is coloring, toy soldiers standing around him. DEAN, ANDREA, and SAM approach the doorway. DEAN enters and crouches down by LUCAS.

DEAN
Hey, Lucas. You remember me?

LUCAS has drawn two more pictures of a red bicycle.

DEAN
You know, I, uh, I wanted to thank you for that last drawing. But the thing is, I need your help again.

LUCAS is drawing a person in water. DEAN opens the house picture and puts it down in front of LUCAS.

DEAN
How did you know to draw this? Did you know something bad was gonna happen? Maybe you could nod yes or no for me.

LUCAS keeps coloring.

DEAN
You're scared. It's okay. I understand. See, when I was your age, I saw something real bad happen to my mom, and I was scared, too. I didn't feel like talking, just like you. But see, my mom—I know she wanted me to be brave. I think about that every day. And I do my best to be brave. And maybe, your dad wants you to be brave too.

LUCAS drops his crayon and looks up at DEAN. He hands DEAN a picture of a white church, a yellow house, and a boy with a blue baseball cap and red bicycle in front of a wooden fence.

DEAN
Thanks, Lucas.

Billy Squier's "Too Daze Gone" starts to play.

MUSIC
Walking through the streets just the other day

CAR
INT. IMPALA — DAY

DEAN and SAM are in the Impala, SAM holding the church picture.

MUSIC
Movin'

DEAN
Andrea said the kid never drew like that till his dad died.

SAM
There are cases—going through a traumatic experience could make people more sensitive to premonitions, psychic tendencies.

DEAN
Whatever's out there, what if Lucas is tapping into it somehow? I mean, it's only a matter of time before somebody else drowns, so if you got a better lead, please.

SAM
All right, we got another house to find.

DEAN
The only problem is there's about a thousand yellow two-stories in this county alone.

SAM looks at the picture.

SAM
See this church? I bet there's less than a thousand of those around here.

DEAN
Oh, College Boy thinks he's so smart.

MUSIC
Too daze gone
I'm broke down, insufferable
My mind is on the blink

SAM
You know, um...

MUSIC
It's later than you think

SAM
What you said about Mom...

MUSIC
And I'm too daze gone

SAM
You never told me that before.

DEAN
It's no big deal.

MUSIC
Went to see a friend just the other day

DEAN
Oh God, we're not gonna have to hug or anything, are we?

MUSIC
Movin'

SWEENEY HOUSE
EXT. CHURCH – DAY

SAM and DEAN approach a white church shaped like the one in LUCAS's picture. DEAN holds up the picture and looks at it, comparing it to the scene in front of him; there's a yellow house next to the church and a wooden fence near the house. SAM looks at DEAN. They both look up at the church and cross the street to the house.

DEAN (voiceover)
We're sorry to bother you, ma'am—

INT. SWEENEY HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and SAM are inside the house, speaking to an OLD WOMAN, MRS. SWEENEY.

DEAN
—but does a little boy live here, by chance? He might wear a blue ball cap, has a red bicycle.

SWEENEY
No sir. Not for a very long time. Peter's been gone for thirty-five years now.

There's a picture of PETER on the side table. SWEENEY sighs.

SWEENEY
The police never—I never had any idea what happened. He just disappeared.

SAM points out to DEAN a number of toy soldiers on a table.

SWEENEY
Losing him—you know, it's...it's worse than dying.

DEAN glances at SAM.

DEAN
Did he disappear from here? I mean, from this house?

SWEENEY
He was supposed to ride his bike straight home after school, and he never showed up.

DEAN picks a picture off the mirror. There are two boys in the picture, one PETER with a bicycle. DEAN reads from the back of the picture.

DEAN
Peter Sweeney and Billy Carlton, nineteen seventy.

LAKE
EXT. LAKE – DAY

BILL is sitting on the bench on the dock, talking to himself, or to the lake.

BILL
You've taken everything, everyone. I've got nothing left. I didn't understand. I didn't believe. Now I think I do. I think I finally know what you want.

IMPALA
INT. IMPALA – DAY

DEAN and SAM are driving.

SAM
Okay, this little boy Peter Sweeney vanishes, and this is all connected to Bill Carlton somehow.

DEAN
Yeah, Bill sure as hell seems to be hiding something, huh?

SAM
And Bill, the people he loves, they're all getting punished.

DEAN
So what if Bill did something to Peter?

SAM
What if Bill killed him?

DEAN
Peter's spirit would be furious. It'd want revenge. It's possible.

EXT. CARLTON HOUSE – DAY

The Impala pulls up in front of the Carlton house. SAM and DEAN approach the house.

SAM
Mr. Carlton?

An engine roars.

EXT. LAKE – DAY

SAM and DEAN go around the house to see BILL going out on the lake in his boat.

DEAN
Hey, check it out.

SAM and DEAN run to the end of the dock, yelling.

DEAN
Mr. Carlton! You need to come back! Come out of the water! Turn the boat around!

SAM
Mr. Carlton!

BILL ignores them and keeps going. The water rises up and flips BILL's boat over. It and he vanish.

ACT THREE
POLICE STATION
INT. POLICE STATION – DAY

LUCAS is sitting in a chair, rocking back and forth. ANDREA is sitting next to him, holding a paper bag and a plastic container.

ANDREA
Baby, what's wrong?

SAM, DEAN, and JAKE DEVINS walk in the door. ANDREA looks over.

ANDREA
Sam, Dean.

ANDREA stands up, putting the bag and container on her chair.

ANDREA
I didn't expect to see you here.

JAKE
So now you're on a first-name basis. What are you doing here?

ANDREA
I brought you dinner.

JAKE
I'm sorry, sweetheart, I don't really have the time.

ANDREA
I heard about Bill Carlton. Is it true? Is something going on with the lake?

JAKE
Right now we don't know what the truth is. But I think it might be better if you and Lucas went on home.

LUCAS looks up and whines, looking stricken; he jumps up and grabs DEAN's arm.

DEAN
Lucas, hey, what is it?

DEAN
Lucas.

ANDREA
Lucas.

DEAN
Lucas, it's okay. It's okay. Hey, Lucas, it's okay. It's okay.

ANDREA pulls LUCAS away from DEAN and leads him outside. LUCAS doesn't look away from DEAN.

JAKE throws down his jacket and goes into his office. SAM and DEAN follow.

JAKE
Okay, just so I'm clear, you see...something attack Bill's boat, sending Bill—who is a very good swimmer, by the way—into the drink, and you never see him again?

DEAN glances at SAM.

DEAN
Yeah, that about sums it up.

JAKE
And I'm supposed to believe this, even though I've already sonar-swept that entire lake? And what you're describing is impossible? And you're not really Wildlife Service?

DEAN looks surprised.

JAKE
That's right, I checked. Department's never heard of you two.

DEAN
See, now, we can explain that.

JAKE
Enough. Please. The only reason you're breathing free air is one of Bill's neighbors saw him steering out that boat just before you did. So, we have a couple of options here. I can arrest you for impersonating government officials and hold you as material witnesses to Bill Carlton's disappearance. Or, we can chalk this all up to a bad day, you get into your car, you put this town in your rearview mirror, and you don't ever darken my doorstep again.

SAM
Door number two sounds good.

JAKE
That's the one I'd pick.

DEVINS/BARR HOUSE
INT. LUCAS'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

LUCAS is in his room with the toy soldiers, drawing another black spiral. ANDREA walks by his door in a robe.

ANDREA
Baby, what are you doing up? Come on. Let's go to bed.

ANDREA picks LUCAS up.

IMPALA
INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are in the Impala, waiting at a traffic light. A sign says I-43 North to Milwaukee is to the left. The light turns green. The Impala doesn't move.

SAM
Green.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Light's green.

DEAN turns right.

SAM
Uh, the interstate's the other way.

DEAN
I know.

INT. BATHROOM – NIGHT

ANDREA is in the bathroom. She plugs the drain of her tub and turns the water on.

INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

SAM and DEAN are in the car.

SAM
But Dean, this job, I think it's over.

DEAN
I'm not so sure.

SAM
If Bill murdered Peter Sweeney and Peter's spirit got its revenge, case closed. The spirit should be at rest.

DEAN
All right, so what if we take off and this thing isn't done? You know, what if we've missed something? What if more people get hurt?

SAM
But why would you think that?

DEAN
Because Lucas was really scared.

SAM
That's what this is about?

DEAN
I just don't want to leave this town until I know the kid's okay.

SAM
Who are you? And what have you done with my brother?

DEAN glances at SAM.

DEAN
Shut up.

DEVINS/BARR HOUSE
INT. BATHROOM – NIGHT

The bathtub is mostly full and ANDREA tests the water with one hand. She takes off her robe and gets in the water. She leans back, grabs a washcloth, and closes her eyes. The water coming out of the faucet turns brown. ANDREA starts washing herself with the cloth, then opens her eyes. The water is entirely brown now. She screams and tries to get out of the tub, but something drags her down.

INT. HALLWAY – NIGHT

LUCAS pounds on the bathroom door.

INT. BATHROOM – NIGHT

ANDREA's head is pulled under the water. She pulls it out. She is pulled under again; lather, rinse, repeat. LUCAS keeps pounding. ANDREA is invisible under the water.

EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT

SAM and DEAN have arrived.

SAM
Are you sure about this? It's pretty late, man.

DEAN rings the doorbell. At that moment, LUCAS opens the door, desperately afraid.

DEAN
Lucas? Lucas!

LUCAS takes off. DEAN and SAM follow him to:

INT. HALLWAY – NIGHT

Water is pouring out from under the bathroom door and down the stairs. LUCAS starts pounding on the bathroom door again. DEAN pushes him over to SAM and kicks in the door. LUCAS grabs DEAN, so SAM runs into the bathroom and sticks his arms in the tub, trying to pull ANDREA out. She is pulled back under, but SAM keeps pulling until ANDREA is all the way out. She starts coughing up water.

ACT FOUR
DEVINS/BARR HOUSE
INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

Dawn is breaking. SAM and ANDREA sit in the living room. ANDREA is dry and wearing comfortable clothing.

SAM
Can you tell me?

ANDREA
No.

DEAN is looking through notebooks on bookshelves.

ANDREA
It doesn't make any sense.

ANDREA starts crying.

ANDREA
I'm going crazy.

She puts her face in her hands.

SAM
No, you're not. Tell me what happened. Everything.

ANDREA
I heard...I thought I heard...there was this voice.

SAM
What did it say?

ANDREA
It said...it said 'come play with me'.

ANDREA sobs.

ANDREA
What's happening?

DEAN pulls out a scrapbook that says "Jake – 12 years old" and opens it, flipping pages. He closes it again and goes to SAM and ANDREA; he puts the book down in front of ANDREA, open to a picture of Explorer Troop 37.

DEAN
Do you recognize the kids in these pictures?

ANDREA
What? Um, um, no. I mean, except that's my dad right there. He must have been about twelve in these pictures.

She moves her finger over to another picture of JAKE as a child; he is standing next to PETER. DEAN looks at SAM.

DEAN
Chris Barr's drowning. The connection wasn't to Bill Carlton. It must have been to the sheriff.

SAM
Bill and the sheriff—they were both involved with Peter.

ANDREA
What about Chris? My dad—what are you talking about?

DEAN looks sideways.

DEAN
Lucas?

LUCAS is staring out the window.

DEAN
Lucas, what is it?

LUCAS opens the door and walks outside. Everyone follows.

ANDREA
Lucas, honey?

LUCAS stops and looks at the ground, then at DEAN.

DEAN
You and Lucas get back to the house and stay there, okay?

ANDREA pulls LUCAS back to the house. DEAN and SAM presumably fetch shovels from the Impala, before they start digging. SAM's shovel clanks against something. They dig with their hands and pull out a red bicycle.

SAM
Peter's bike.

JAKE
Who are you?

SAM and DEAN turn around; JAKE is there, pointing a gun at them.

SAM
Put the gun down, Jake.

SAM and DEAN drop the shovels.

JAKE
How did you know that was there?

DEAN
What happened? You and Bill killed Peter, drowned him in the lake and then buried the bike? You can't bury the truth, Jake. Nothing stays buried.

ANDREA sees JAKE with the gun aimed at SAM and DEAN. She talks to LUCAS.

ANDREA
Go to your room, sweetie. Now. Lock the door and wait for me. Don't come out.

LUCAS runs off. ANDREA goes outside.

JAKE
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

DEAN
You and Bill killed Peter Sweeney thirty-five years ago. That's what the hell I'm talking about.

ANDREA runs up.

ANDREA
Dad!

DEAN
And now you got one seriously pissed-off spirit.

SAM
It's gonna take Andrea, Lucas, everyone you love. It's gonna drown them. And it's gonna drag their bodies God knows where, so you can feel the same pain Peter's mom felt. And then, after that, it's gonna take you, and it's not gonna stop until it does.

JAKE
Yeah, and how do you know that?

SAM
Because that's exactly what it did to Bill Carlton.

JAKE
Listen to yourselves, both of you. You're insane.

DEAN
I don't really give a rat's ass what you think of us. But if we're gonna bring down this spirit, we need to find the remains, salt them, and burn them into dust. Now tell me you buried Peter somewhere. Tell me you didn't just let him go in the lake.

LUCAS didn't go to his room; he's outside watching.

PETER
Come play with me.

LUCAS follows the voice.

ANDREA
Dad, is any of this true?

JAKE
No. Don't listen to them. They're liars and they're dangerous.

ANDREA
Something tried to drown me. Chris died on that lake. Dad, look at me.

JAKE does.

ANDREA
Tell me you—you didn't kill anyone.

JAKE looks away.

ANDREA
Oh my God.

JAKE
Billy and I were at the lake. Peter was the smallest one. We always bullied him, but this time, it got rough. We were holding his head under the water. We didn't mean to. But we held him under too long and he drowned. We let the body go, and it sank.

DEAN glances at SAM.

JAKE
Oh, Andrea, we were kids. We were so scared. It was a mistake. But, Andrea, to say that I have anything to do with these drownings, with Chris, because of some ghost? It's not rational.

DEAN
All right, listen to me, all of you. We need to get you away from this lake, as far as we can, right now.

ANDREA turns her head and spots LUCAS going down to the lake. She gasps.

JAKE
Lucas!

They all run up to the dock. LUCAS is leaning over the side, reaching for a toy soldier in the water.

PETER
Come play with me.

DEAN
Lucas!

ANDREA
Lucas! Baby, stay where you are!

A hand comes up and pulls LUCAS into the water. The adults have reached the edge of the lake. JAKE stops. PETER's head is visible; JAKE recognizes him. DEAN and SAM keep running to the end of the dock and dive in.

ANDREA
Oh my God!

She takes off her jacket to jump in.

SAM
Andrea, stay there!

ANDREA
No! Lucas!

SAM
We'll get him! Just stay on the dock!

SAM dives under again. DEAN comes up. A minute later, so does SAM.

DEAN
Sam?

SAM shakes his head.

ANDREA
Lucas, where are you?

JAKE takes off his jacket as SAM and DEAN dive back down. JAKE wades in. ANDREA looks over.

JAKE
Peter, if you can hear me...please, Peter, I'm sorry. I'm so—I'm so sorry.

ANDREA
Daddy, no!

JAKE
Peter. Lucas—he's, he's just a little boy. Please, it's not his fault, it's mine. Please take me.

DEAN and SAM come up for air.

DEAN
Jake, no!

PETER surfaces.

JAKE
Just let it be over!

JAKE is dragged down.

ANDREA
Daddy! Daddy! No!

DEAN and SAM dive down again.

ANDREA
No!

SAM comes up, shaking his head. ANDREA mouths 'no!'

DEAN comes up, holding LUCAS, who isn't moving.

EPILOGUE
EXT. STREET – DAY

DEAN and SAM walk out of the motel. DEAN opens the car door and SAM tosses a duffel in.

SAM
Look, we're not gonna save everybody.

DEAN
I know.

ANDREA
Sam, Dean.

ANDREA walks up with LUCAS.

DEAN
Hey.

ANDREA
We're glad we caught you. We just, um, we made you lunch for the road.

LUCAS is carrying a tray of sandwiches.

ANDREA
Lucas insisted on making the sandwiches himself.

LUCAS
Can I give it to them now?

ANDREA
Of course.

ANDREA smiles and kisses LUCAS's head.

DEAN
Come on, Lucas, let's load this into the car.

SAM
How you holding up?

ANDREA
It's just gonna take a long time to sort through everything, you know?

SAM sighs.

SAM
Andrea, I'm sorry.

ANDREA shakes her head.

ANDREA
You saved my son. I can't ask for more than that. Dad loved me. He loved Lucas. No matter what he did, I just have to hold on to that.

DEAN puts the sandwiches in the car.

DEAN
All right, if you're gonna be talking now, this is a very important phrase, so I want you to repeat it one more time.

LUCAS
Zeppelin rules!

DEAN
That's right. Up high.

DEAN holds his hand up for a high-five. LUCAS obliges, grinning.

DEAN
You take care of your mom, okay?

LUCAS
All right.

ANDREA comes up and kisses DEAN.

ANDREA
Thank you.

DEAN thinks a minute, then scratches his head and goes around the car.

DEAN
Sam, move your ass. We're gonna run out of daylight before we hit the road.

DEAN gets in the car, then SAM. Bad Company's "Movin' On" starts to play when DEAN starts the engine.

MUSIC
I got to move on and I never seem to slow down

SAM and DEAN smile at ANDREA and LUCAS waving goodbye.

MUSIC
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm moving on, moving on from town to town

SAM and DEAN drive away.

EXT. ROAD – DAY

MUSIC
Yeah yeah yeah, I never seem to slow down

The Impala drives on.
