TEASER
NAZI-OCCUPIED FRANCE, 1943 GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS

BEFEHLSLEITER GUMPRECHT

(on phone, speaking German)

It has arrived.

Yes, I have ordered a full military escort.

Naturally…

…I will bring the artifact to you.

Please… it is my great honor.

DELPHINE SEYDOUX

The bed is cold.

GUMPRECHT

Liebchen

DELPHINE

What does that mean, mon amour?

GUMPRECHT

(Taps on an very old wooden box) This is why I've come here.

DELPHINE

And I thought you occupied my country to meet me.

GUMPRECHT

Mmm hmm. You were a bonus, Delphine. A treasure. Ma petite collaboratrice. But this, this is what my country has been waiting for.

DELPHINE

Can I see it?

GUMPRECHT

(tsks) Naughty, Delphine.

[DELPHINE says a word in French.]

GUMPRECHT

One little peek?

[GUMPRECHT leads DELPHINE over to the table. He kisses her neck as she opens the box.]

DELPHINE

So, it's true.

[GUMPRECHT continues kissing her. She smiles as she takes the pin out of her hair and shakes it loose. As they are about to kiss, she suddenly stabs him in the neck.]

DELPHINE

I have lived a hard life. But these months, pretending to love a Nazi cochon like you has been the worst. But this moment - watching you die - it is the best.

[DELPHINE pulls GUMPRECHT's knife from its sheath and stabs him through the heart. He falls to the floor, dead. DELPHINE grabs the box.]

DELPHINE

The Men of Letters send their regards.

[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE
[Interior - The Bunker's kitchen - morning]

[DEAN comes in to find SAM already up, sitting at the table doing research. DEAN tries to pour himself a cup of coffee but finds the coffee pot empty.]

SAM

We're out.

DEAN

There was a half a bag yesterday!

SAM

I killed it. Hey, did you know the Nazis had a special branch devoted to archaeology?

DEAN

Little early for Nazi trivia, especially without caffeine.

SAM

It's called the "Ahnenerbe", there were sites all over Germany, and then as the Nazis increased their territory, they started popping in Poland, Finland, uh, North Africa…

DEAN

Yeah, how is this more important than our coffee situation?

SAM

'Cause I found something. I mean, we need something. Magic. A weapon strong enough to give us a shot against Amara. So, I've been looking outside the lore in history. And I found this, the Vichy Memorandems. They were Nazi communications that puzzle historians to this day. And they speak of a super weapon obtained by the Ahnenerbe, said to be strong enough to win the war.

DEAN

Yeah? What was it?

SAM

Well, these memos refer to it as "The Hand of God." I mean, that was sort of a catch all term for several objects he touched on Earth in Biblical times. But they're believed to contain traces of His power.

DEAN

Yeah, well the Nazis believed a lot of things.

SAM

Dean, Lucifer's caged. God's MIA, the only beings strong enough to battle Amara are gone. If we're gonna fight her, what better way to arm up than with an actual dose of His power?

DEAN

Okay, so you said the Nazis got their hand on one of these, uh, hands?

SAM

Right.

DEAN

Well if it was so powerful it could win them the war, why didn't it?

SAM

Because they lost it. En route to Berlin, it was stolen. The Nazis searched high and low for the thief, but they never found their prime suspect, uh, here - Delphine Seydoux. French mistress to a high-ranking Nazi. Thought to be a French traitor, 'til she killed her German lover, and made off with the weapon.

DEAN

Allied spy? French resistance?

SAM

That's what the Nazis thought. But their investigation led them to a different conclusion. That she was an "un femme de lettre."

[DEAN looks blankly at SAM.]

SAM

A Woman of Letters.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - HELL - DAY]

[LUCIFER sits on the throne that once to belong to CROWLEY, playing a game on an iPad. A number of demons stand before him in an awkward silence. One of the demons approaches.]

DEMON

Ah, sir. Would you like to hear the latest soul numbers?

LUCIFER

No, because I don't care.

DEMON

How about an update on Amara?

[LUCIFER looks up.]

DEMON

Well the update is… well that there is no update. We still haven't found -

SIMMONS

[interrupting the first demon] Sir, if I may - since you've claimed the throne, we could use some direction.

[LUCIFER rolls his eyes.]

SIMMONS

ANY direction. We could deploy a force. Real boots on the ground, shake the trees to find her! With you leading the charge, of course. We have had a coward, and a fool, at the helm for too long.

[A moaning noise is heard.]

SIMMONS

Perhaps, it's time to -

[LUCIFER holds his finger to his lips. The camera pans to show a cage door off to the side of the chamber.]

LUCIFER

Doggy wants to speak.

[One of the DEMONS opens the cage door, and CROWLEY is rolled out, in chains. The demons stare at him.]

CROWLEY

How dare you. The imputence. The lack of humility. It's no way to talk to your master. Lucifer.

LUCIFER

That's a good doggy.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM - DAY]

[SAM and DEAN are looking through drawers and books, researching.]

DEAN

Who knew the Men of Letters had European chapters?

SAM

Maybe it wasn't an entire chapter, just an asset, you know?

DEAN

Yeah, and letting women join way back in the forties? I just never got the impression that they were so big on gender equality, you know, it's right there in the name.

SAM

Well it was World War II. Kind of an all-hands-on-deck situation, you know?

DEAN

Yeah, Rosie the Riveter. Cool.

SAM

Here we go. This report was written by Clifford Henshaw, a bunker-based Men of Letters back in 1943. It's the right era. But it's in French.

[Cut to SAM scanning the French book with a translator. DEAN comes in, drinking a beer.]

DEAN

Well?

SAM

Hey. So it's definitely about Delphine. Her name's at the top of every page. Check this out. Transcriptions. From transatlantic cables between Clifford and Delphine.

DEAN

What'd they say?

SAM

Give me a second. Web translation's kind of buggy.

[DEAN takes a swig of beer.]

SAM

Seriously? Dude it's like noon.

DEAN

Uh, well you drank all the coffee, so what am I supposed to drink, water?

SAM

Look at this. They were making arrangements to get the artifact out of Europe to keep it safe. Henshaw pulled some strings with a Man of Letters in the OSS to requisition an active US submarine to transport Delphine and the weapon back to the States. Back to here.

DEAN

The Bunker?

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

So it's been here the whole time.

SAM

Uh…. (searches some more) No. It never arrived. The USS Bluefin came under German attack midway through its trip across the Atlantic, the sub was sunk, the ship and its contents haven't been recovered to this day. Great. It's lost.

DEAN

Or is it?

SAM

Yeah, I'd say so. I mean, tides took the wreckage, submersibles have been trying to locate it for years. I mean if James Cameron and his Avatar billions can't find it…

DEAN

Yeah, but - we have something James Cameron doesn't have.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - HELL - DAY]

[LUCIFER watches as several demons wheel in an assortment of medieval-looking weapons. He walks over and takes one, looking disappointed.]

LUCIFER

That's all of it?

DEMON

Yes sir. The requested weaponry from your crypt. Does it please you?

LUCIFER

Spare me.

[The demons leave. LUCIFER approaches CROWLEY and pokes him with a staff.]

LUCIFER

How are your wounds, doggy?

CROWLEY

They are…no less than I deserve.

[LUCIFER scratches CROWLEY's head.]

LUCIFER

(Croons) Aww, you're scared of your Master. That's a good doggy.

[LUCIFER grabs CROWLEY's ear and pulls his head up.]

LUCIFER

But it's an act. I broke you, but um… (smells him) Yep, I can still smell it, you've got that delectable little whiff of defiance, you're just playing, huh? Waiting for your moment to retake the throne? Am I right?

CROWLEY

Yes, sir.

LUCIFER

Well, then. Tell me, once and future king of Hell, you've been watching my role, what treasonous thoughts do you have brewing in that little head of yours, huh?

[CROWLEY is silent. LUCIFER hits him lightly over the head.]

LUCIFER

What are you really thinking? Hmm?

CROWLEY

The truth, sir?

LUCIFER

Yeah.

CROWLEY

You're not strong enough. You had your weapons delivered, you realize they won't be enough. If you thought you could beat Amara you'd be taking the fight to her! Right now.

LUCIFER

You're a clever little doggy. You're right, at the moment, I may be a bit under-equipped. Maybe defeating Amara was a bit more of a team effort than I led certain people to believe. All that said, I'm still your Master, did I let you out of that kennel too soon?

[LUCIFER'S phone rings.]

CROWLEY

(whispers) No.

LUCIFER

No barking. It's showtime.

[LUCIFER answers the phone, and grimaces as he imitates CASTIEL's voice.]

LUCIFER

Hello Dean.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE BUNKER, WAR ROOM - DAY]

LUCIFER

There were several God-touched objects, but it never occurred to me that any of them survived the flood, let alone the twentieth century.

SAM

Do you think we can use it against Amara?

LUCIFER

It's perfect. And I can get you back there.

SAM

Without wings? Cas, you can't even teleport.

LUCIFER

Time travel, is a, it's a whole different system.

DEAN

Told ya!

LUCIFER

So uh, these the last coordinates?

DEAN

That's the Bluefin's last transmission to shore, yeah.

LUCIFER

Alright.

SAM

Wait a second. Cas, aren't there still risks with time travel? I mean aren't there consequences?

DEAN

Sam, this is the ideal scenario.

SAM

What?

DEAN

That sub is a tin can floating in the middle of the ocean doomed to go down, you can't really mess with history at 20,000 leagues. So we get in, get the weapon, get out. It's a milk run.

SAM

Well that's not a very good plan.

DEAN

Well, if things get outta hand, then Cas will just, zap me right back.

SAM

You?

DEAN

You're not going.

SAM

I beg your pardon?

DEAN

You need to stay here.

SAM

Stay here?

DEAN

Just in case things go sideways, somebody needs to be left standing to take care of the Darkness. We can't risk us both! And at the moment, I'm the least valuable player! You both know that I can't kill Amara, so the least I could do is get the thing that we need so that you can!

SAM

So you expect me to sit here and ride pine while you can Cas go play Jules Verne?

DEAN

Yes! No. I - who?

LUCIFER

I won't let him out of my sight.

SAM

You'll stay by his side the entire time?

LUCIFER

I will.

DEAN

Sam, let me do this. Okay, I need to do this.

SAM

(Resigned) Be safe.

DEAN

When am I not?

(hits the table) Let's do this, Cas.

[DEAN walks over to LUCIFER.]

DEAN

Bon voyage.

[LUCIFER puts his hand on DEAN's shoulder.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR, USS BLUEFIN SUBMARINE, 1943]

[DEAN stands in the middle of a submarine, LUCIFER nowhere to be seen. He is surrounded by sleeping soldiers.]

DEAN

(whispering) Cas?

[DEAN backs up slowly, unsure of what to do, taking in his new surroundings.]

DEAN

(whispering) Cas?

ACT TWO
[Two soldiers enter.]

PETEY GIRALDI

See, I enlisted to sink German ships. Let's go, vacation's over. You know, we got zip running controls in the bay, now Captain's got us going in the wrong direction? To run some mystery mission for some broad? Tell me how that makes sense.

OTHER SOLDIER

I wouldn't worry about it. Get some rest.

PETEY

You know I can't rest.

[The camera tilts downward to reveal DEAN on the floor, hiding underneath the bunks. PETEY gets into his bunk and props himself up, with some reading material. Under the bunk, DEAN looks around and sees a mysterious sigil painted on the opposite wall.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE BUNKER, WAR ROOM - DAY]

[SAM is looking at a photograph of the USS Bluefin in a book when he hears the door of the Bunker open. He looks up to see a soaking wet LUCIFER trudge down the stairs, dripping water everywhere.]

SAM

Cas? Why're you - wait a second, where's Dean?

LUCIFER

We made the leap, he got on, I didn't.

SAM

What?

LUCIFER

I couldn't make it past the hull.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE USS BLUEFIN, 1943]

[PETEY hears a coin drop on the floor. He gets out of his bunk to investigate. He picks it up and looks at it more closely.]

PETEY

1996?

[DEAN jumps him, and wrestles him into a headlock.]

DEAN

Where's Delphine? Where's the broad?

PETEY

I don't - I don't know what you're talkin' about.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM]

LUCIFER

Someone must've warded the ship!

SAM

Delphine? It has to be, I mean she's protecting the weapon, right? Cas, just go back to their last port, before she boarded! Leave a message so Dean knows!

LUCIFER

Where? Where would Dean see it that the crew wouldn't? He's as likely to find the warding as he is any message I'd leave.

SAM

Then send me. You got Dean past the hull.

LUCIFER

Right. We'll double down on what screwed us the first time. You're really bringing your A ideas today. I can't believe I lost it. (sighs) Him. Can't believe I lost Dean. Well, it's up to him now to find and clear the warding.

SAM

No. We can help. There's gotta be something in magic or angel lore. Some way to clear the sigils from the outside. Cas, don't worry. We'll bring him back.

[SAM slams a large book on the table and opens it.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR - USS BLUEFIN, 1943]

[DEAN is now dressed in full sailor's uniform, complete with a white hat. He makes his way down a corridor lined with bunks filled with soldiers on either side, trying to remain unnoticed.]

SOLDIER

Look out, comin' through! Comin' through!

[The SOLDIER squeezes past DEAN as another one enters the corridor from the other end. DEAN looks down, trying to hide his face and remain incognito.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR - ANOTHER PART OF THE USS BLUEFIN]

[DELPHINE looks in a doorway off the corridor.]

DELPHINE

When can I smoke?

HARRIS THE COOK

When it's your turn, I'll let you know.

DELPHINE

Surely some of your boys take breaks in the engine room.

[DELPHINE goes into the galley area and sits down at a table.]

HARRIS

Captain wants you to stay put.

DELPHINE

Let me guess. He fears I will distract his men. Does not want the skirt roaming the decks, gimme the light.

HARRIS

Ma'am, you're wearing pants.

[HARRIS takes the cigarette out of DELPHINE'S mouth and leaves.]

[As HARRIS leaves, DEAN enters.]

HARRIS

Rich, ain't it? Frog's sitting pretty like Queen of Sheba getting room service in the war room. And I can't even gripe, cause - you seen that dame? The gams on her? (whistles)

DEAN

Yeah, yeah she's a hottie.

[HARRIS pauses and looks at DEAN strangely.]

DEAN

Yeah those gams, huh?

[DEAN walks away to where DELPHINE is still sitting at the table. He looks at her.]

DELPHINE

Who are you?

DEAN

Delphine.

[DELPHINE stares at DEAN.]

DEAN

You might find this hard to believe.

[Without warning, DELPHINE stands up and kicks, punches, and throws DEAN against the wall where she pins him.]

DELPHINE

Not a soul on this ship knows my name, so I repeat. Who are you?

[CUT TO INTERIOR - USS BLUEFIN'S CORRIDOR]

[HARRIS and PETEY, along with several other men make their way quickly toward the galley where DEAN and DELPHINE are.]

HARRIS

Comin' through!

[Cut to DEAN and DELPHINE]

DEAN

I'm a friend of Clifford Henshaw. I'm a Man of Letters.

[DELPHINE glares at him as HARRIS and PETEY barge in.]

PETEY

That's him! That's the guy! Captain!

[DELPHINE is pulled away, and she sits back down at the table as the CAPTAIN enters. DEAN is thrown down in another seat.]

PETEY

He took my clothes and hog-tied me in the head, this guy.

HARRIS

What should we do with him, Captain?

CAPTAIN

Search him.

[HARRIS pats him down.]

DEAN

Alright, alright.

[HARRIS finds DEAN's cell phone and holds it up.]

HARRIS

Petey. This yours?

PETEY

What the hell is this?

[Everyone in the room stares at DEAN.]

DEAN

(pauses) It's a phone.

HARRIS

Right. A phone, in your pocket.

PETEY

Next thing this guy's gonna tell us is that he's from space.

HARRIS

Yeah or the future.

DEAN I am.

DEAN looks at DELPHINE, and then at the CAPTAIN.

DEAN

Captain James Dearborn? My name is Dean Winchester and I am on a mission from the future. The details of which I am not at liberty to discuss. But know this, within the hour, a German destroyer will find and attack this submarine. And you will go down.

[The others look at each other with disbelief etched on their faces.]

ACT THREE
CAPTAIN

Okay, you've said your piece. Let me tell you what I think.

DELPHINE

Captain -

CAPTAIN

I think you're a soldier that's gone AWOL. You've hopped a ride home on this cock-eyed story, in some loony attempt to keep your cover as a civvie. That, or you're a spy. Deciding which, I'll leave that to the Court Marshal.

DELPHINE

I need to speak with this man. Alone!

CAPTAIN

Not a chance.

[CAPTAIN takes his revolver and hands it to PETEY.]

DELPHINE

Captain - there are things - things about this mission that you don't know.

CAPTAIN

Flash Gordon here will remain under guard until we reach the shore.

PETEY

Gladly.

DELPHINE

What if we don't reach shore, what if he's right?

CAPTAIN

The odds of a German attack from a surface ship? This far west? Hunting down a lone submarine?

[The CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT enters.]

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Captain.

[They go off to the side.]

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Sonar's picked up a surface ship on a steady bearing, closing.

CAPTAIN

(this news sinking in) Understood.

[CAPTAIN turns back to DEAN and the others.]

CAPTAIN

Harris, back to your station. Giraldi, watch our guest.

PETEY

Yes, sir.

DELPHINE

The Germans, they've come for it.

DEAN

Delphine, the warding on the hull, the sigil. That's not like any I've seen.

[CUT TO BLUEFIN'S CONTROL ROOM]

CAPTAIN

You're certain of the identification?

NAVIGATION OFFICER

Yes, sir. Uh, 36 B German Destroyer, 3000 yards and closing, bearing 0, 9 and 0.

CAPTAIN

Clear the bridge.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Clear the bridge!

[CUT BACK TO DELPHINE AND DEAN IN THE GALLEY]

DELPHINE

My mentor in the Men of Letters - he taught me the symbol before he died.

PETEY

World Series, 1944. Go.

[DEAN just looks at him.]

PETEY

You're from the future… tell me, who won?

DEAN

Um, the uh… the Rangers.

PETEY

The Rangers?

DELPHINE

He believed it would keep me and the artifact safe on our journey.

PETEY

Who are the Rangers?

DELPHINE

From supernatural interference.

DEAN

And angelic interference.

DELPHINE

Angels? They are not real.

PETEY

Who are the Rangers?

[DEAN turns to look at PETEY.]

DEAN

Look, kid, I don't follow baseball. (Turns back to DELPHINE) Okay, yeah, and angels are real, in fact one of them is my ride off this ship. Now look, the warding that you put up to block the magic must have blocked him too. I cleared the one, if there's any more, we gotta clear those too, otherwise I'm stuck here.

PETEY

Okay then, the next president.

DEAN

Delphine, you wanted the weapon to be in the Men of Letters safe house. Right? I'm from the Bunker. That's how I knew how to find you. From your communication with Henshaw. Now if you clear the way, I can get it there for you.

DELPHINE

And that's why you came? To protect the… object. The weapon?

PETEY

You gonna answer my question?

DEAN

Eisenhower. Okay - no - uh… Truman. Now would you please shut up? (To DELPHINE) No. This sub is going down. But the allies do win. But from Men of Letters to Men of Letters, I'm fighting a war in the future. It's not like your war, it's big. Biblical, end-is-nigh big. And I need your weapon to win. That is why I came.

PETEY

But we all die? Me, the girl… the rest of the crew… I'm just trying to get your story clear.

[DEAN is quiet but looks somber and uncomfortable.]

DEAN

Yes.

[There is a long silence.]

DEAN

Look, I know that's a lot to ask. Especially from a complete stranger.

DELPHINE

You're not a stranger. From Men of Letters to Men of Letters - I trust you.

[CUT TO CONTROL CENTER]

ONE OF THE CREW

Hatch secure!

CAPTAIN

(Looking through the periscope) Alt our course to 2-7-0, take us down to 60 feet.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Alt our course to 2-7-0!

OFFICER

Altering course to 2-7-0.

CAPTAIN

Dive! Dive! Dive!

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM]

LUCIFER is sitting a table, leafing through a book looking bored.

SAM

Wait a second. I think I have something. The spell of gathering, it's an incantation used to focus the power of celestial beings, angels, against all drawn forms of evasion. The spell is designed to clear all mystical or occult blockages. I mean this is highly theoretical magic, it's never been used before, but it sounds like it could work.

LUCIFER

And the ingredients?

SAM

Uh…

[SAM reads the list, and then sits back in his chair, disappointed.]

SAM

All but one. That's why it's never been used before, it requires the power of an archangel.

[SAM shuts the book. LUCIFER looks thoughtful.]

LUCIFER

Well Sam, we may as well try.

SAM

We don't have time for long shots, Cas. Even at full power you're not strong enough.

[SAM gets up and walks away, leaving LUCIFER alone at the table with the spell book. LUCIFER opens the book again and turns to the spell.]

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE USS BLUEFIN, GALLEY]

[DELPHINE opens the old wooden box that she had stolen from the GUMPRECHT. DEAN watches her with anticipation. She unwraps the contents to reveal a piece of wood that looks so ancient it appears to be petrified.]

DEAN

That's the Hand of God? Doesn't look like much.

DELPHINE

No, I suppose it doesn't. It must have been more impressive in its complete form - The Ark of the Covenant.

DEAN

Oh, so full-on Raiders. That's - okay.

[DEAN reaches out to touch it, but DELPHINE stops him.]

DELPHINE

Don't touch it or hand it. Its power is potent and unstable. (She shuts the box.) No mortal can survive long with direct contact. (She pushes the box into DEAN's hands.) I'll remove the warding. I'll be back. Promise.

[DEAN tries to stand up, but PETEY raises his gun.]

PETEY

Whoa whoa whoa! Definitely not you.

[DEAN sits down again, hands raised.]

DEAN

Okay.

[There is a long pause.]

PETEY

When?

DEAN

When what?

PETEY

When do we win? Months, years, decades? Got a lot of friends and family on other ships, and other branches, I wanna know what their chances are.

DEAN

Years. 1945.

[Another pause.]

DEAN

You believe me?

PETEY

(Nodding slightly) I read a lot of Flash Gordon.

[CUT TO THE CAPTAIN AND THE NAVIGATION OFFICERS]

NAVIGATION OFFICER

15 hundred yards! We are not shaking them!

CAPTAIN

Battle stations!

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Sir, respectfully, our orders were to go home. Not engage.

CAPTAIN

That so, do not make me repeat myself.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Battle stations!

[CUT TO DEAN IN THE GALLEY]

[The lights go dark, and the red emergency lights start flashing as the orders to man the battle stations come over the intercom.]

[CUT TO THE CORRIDOR]

[Someone's voice can be heard in the corridor yelling "Let's go! Let's go!" as the soldiers spill out of their quarters and ready themselves for action. As the soldiers run off, the camera tilts down to show DELPHINE undoing one of the sigils she had painted.]

[CUT TO CONTROL ROOM]

OFFICER

Stand by to load 2 number 8.

CAPTAIN

Load aft torpedo!

CONTROL OFFICER 2

Load aft torpedoes.

[HARRIS and other soldiers start loading the torpedoes.]

OFFICER

Ready to fire.

ANOTHER OFFICER

Ready to fire.

CONTROL OFFICER

800 yards and closing.

NAVIGATION OFFICER 2

Torpedoes loaded.

CAPTAIN

Line us up for a bow shot.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Line up for a bow shot!

OTHER SOLDIER

Lining up for bow shot.

SOLDIER

Locked.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

In position! Ready to fire.

[Things get quiet.]

NAVIGATION OFFICER

Captain! I've - I've lost its position.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

What?

NAVIGATION OFFICER

He's gone.

CAPTAIN

How is it possible to lose a 3,000 ton warship from 800 yards? Find him!

[A few moments later, a banging sound.]

NAVIGATION OFFICER

30 yards sir, he's right on top of us! How?

CAPTAIN

For negative, take us down to max depth and rig for silent running.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Silent running!

[The sub descends deeper into the ocean.]

[In the GALLEY, DEAN and PETEY can feel the sub descending and swaying. DEAN looks around, slightly unnerved.]

DEAN

What's happening?

PETEY

Ssshhh! (points upward)

[DEAN looks up nervously.]

[CUT back to the CONTROL ROOM]

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

(To CAPTAIN) Leveling on 300, sir.

[CUT back to GALLEY]

[DELPHINE enters. She starts to unbutton her shirt, and then pulls her collar away to reveal a sigil carved into her skin just below her collarbone. She pulls out a knife and hands it out to DEAN.]

DELPHINE

Kill me.

PETEY

Wait!

[PETEY looks at DEAN.]

PETEY

You can't do that.

[DELPHINE gives him a look, and hands the knife to DEAN, who takes it reluctantly.]

DELPHINE

(whispering) Kill me.

[Above the Bluefin, what looks like a bomb has been dropped into the water, and it is descending toward them.]

[CUT TO CONTROL ROOM]

NAVIGATION OFFICER

Splashes! Depth Charge!

[They all look upward with intense apprehension.]

[CUT TO GALLEY]

DEAN

I don't have to kill you. Okay, I can just cut it, it will work.

DELPHINE

Not with this. It's spell-bound to my blood, my heart. Its' power lives and dies with me. Do it!

[Another shot of the bomb as it sinks closer and closer to the Bluefin…]

[DEAN gently puts his hand on DELPHINE'S shoulder and holds the knife next to the sigil. He looks into her eyes. The knife touches her skin and draws a little blood, just as the bomb hits the Bluefin and explodes one end of the sub. They all fall over/stumble and look around wildly, terrified. Another bomb hits. In the corridor, HARRIS finds a fallen soldier in the corridor and yells, "WE NEED A MEDIC!"]

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM]

[LUCIFER cuts up ingredients for the spell, and puts them into a metal bowl in front of him. SAM enters.]

SAM

Hey. Cas, what is that?

LUCIFER

It's your spell of gathering.

SAM

You nuts? You're not strong enough Cas, you could get hurt!

LUCIFER

You find a better option?

SAM

Well, no, but… without a serious boost to your angel power, that spell won't even work!

LUCIFER

My strength may surprise you.

SAM

Wait a second. I remember Bobby told me when you needed strength to retrieve us from the past, you used him to power up, you touched his soul, right?

LUCIFER

That's right, I did that. But that procedure can be fatal.

SAM

Use my soul. That way maybe you'll have enough power to wield the spell.

LUCIFER

That isn't necessary.

SAM

It's worth the risk. Cas, Dean needs our help. I trust you.

[LUCIFER smiles, then starts laughing.]

SAM

(confused) What?

LUCIFER

Oh, it's just - I don't need you anymore. I mean, Dean's the one with the link to Amara, why have I been trying to spare you? I mean maybe it's because you're like the girl who kept turning me down at the prom.

[LUCIFER grabs SAM and slams him against one of the Bunker's support columns.]

LUCIFER

I will touch your soul. Just because you asked so nicely, and I'll use your spell to blast through the warding and retrieve Dean and the uh, Hand of God, and then when Dean comes back and he finds this place decorated with your guts, I will tell him the truth, Sam. I'll just say, 'Dean - '

[LUCIFER pauses and smiles, before putting on his CASTIEL voice.]

LUCIFER

- 'Dean… he knew the risks. He wouldn't take no for an answer.'

SAM

Lucifer.

LUCIFER

In the flesh.

[SAM looks horrified, as LUCIFER puts his hand in to touch SAM's soul. SAM yells agony. LUCIFER looks as though he is savoring the moment, until all of a sudden his expression changes, and he withdraws his hand and releases SAM, who falls to the ground unconscious. LUCIFER looks at his hand as an angelic ringing becomes audible.]

LUCIFER

(With a slightly strained expression) Hello Castiel.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - USS BLUEFIN, CONTROL ROOM]

[The Bluefin is now taking on water, and the situation looks dire.]

CAPTAIN

Situation report.

NAVIGATION OFFICER

Battery room is flooded. Hull's breached.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

We're dead in the water.

NAVIGATION OFFICER

Ship's locked in position above us.

OTHER NAVIGATION OFFICER

Captain. The Germans are sending a message. Sir. It's not for you.

[DEAN and DELPHINE are shown out of the galley and led to the CONTROL ROOM.]

CAPTAIN

Go ahead.

[The NAVIGATION OFFICER enables communication with the Germans. A familiar voice comes across the transmission.]

GUMPRECHT

Hello, my Liebchen.

DELPHINE

(In disbelief) It is not possible, I killed you.

GUMPRECHT

A little advice, Delphine. If you want a friend of the Thule to stay dead, burn the body. A word with the captain. You may have noticed you are up against a warship. And a crew possessing, let us say, extraordinary abilities. And you have taken damage that you cannot recover from. So, I offer you a choice. Surface now, relinquish the girl and her cargo, and I can assure you and your men the highest of POW treaties. Or, you can protect her and we will discharge you and your boat right into the seabed. And recover the cargo ourselves. You have three minutes to surrender.

[DEAN and the crew of the Bluefin look around at each other and DELPHINE, tense.]

DELPHINE

I don't expect you to understand. But this cargo, the Germans can't have it. You need to believe me.

CAPTAIN

Our orders were to protect you and your cargo. We wouldn't even consider a surrender.

DELPHINE

(To Dean) You had better consider. Killing me is your only way off this ship.

[DEAN looks at the box in his hands, as another idea comes to him.]

DEAN

Maybe not. Teach me how to use it. It's the power of God! Maybe I can use it to save you. Save the sub.

DELPHINE

And your war?

DEAN

I wanna help you now.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

Two minutes, Captain.

DELPHINE

You save this ship, get us to the surface, and then what? The power of God will consume you. And you'll have merely have brought the weapon closer to the Nazi's grasp. We're supposed to die. Let us do it with a purpose.

[DELPHINE opens the box.]

DELPHINE

How long can you keep the boat steady?

CAPTAIN

Not long. And once they resume their attack…

DELPHINE

Give me every second you can.

DEAN

Delphine what are you doing?

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

One minute!

DELPHINE

I'm going to get you home. And I'm going to get you and your men your first German ship.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM]

[SAM is still on the floor, regaining consciousness. He slowly sits up as CASTIEL falls onto the floor beside him. SAM tries to get away from him.]

SAM

No, no!

CASTIEL (Struggling to hold LUCIFER back) Sam, it's me.

SAM

Cas? Why?

CASTIEL

I wanted to be of service to the fight. And only Lucifer can beat her.

SAM

You chose this? You have to fight, Cas! Eject him now!

CASTIEL

I can't! It's taking all my strength to keep him from killing you. And besides, we need him!

SAM

No Cas, we don't. We'll find another way to stop Amara!

CASTIEL

(Shakes his head) We need him to save Dean.

SAM

You can't time travel.

CASTIEL

(Shakes his head again) Only Lucifer can.

[CUT TO INTERIOR - USS BLUEFIN, CONTROL CENTER]

DELPHINE

How fast is your ride back?

DEAN

Fast.

DELPHINE

Good.

CAPTAIN'S ASSISTANT

It's time!

[DELPHINE takes the Hand of God from the box, and holds it in her hands. She looks at Dean as more bombs explode in the water around them, the reverberations causing them to lose their balance. As she stands up again, the Hand of God begins to glow gold.]

CAPTAIN

God help us all.

[The power from the Hand of God travels through her, and her eyes and entire body begin to glow, light emanating from within her. DEAN stares at her as she drops the Hand of God, and things start to spark and explode around them. DEAN grabs the Hand of God with the cloth it was wrapped in. Parts of the sub are now on fire. As the power continues to surge through DELPHINE, LUCIFER appears behind DEAN, and he transports them off of the submarine just as another bomb goes off. Back in the Bunker's main room, DEAN sees SAM on the floor.]

SAM

Dean - THAT'S NOT CAS!

[DEAN stares at SAM, then looks at LUCIFER. A sheepish, gleeful look crosses LUCIFER'S face.]

LUCIFER

Cat's out!

[LUCIFER throws DEAN across the table, and DEAN lands on the floor on the other side of the table, against the wall.

LUCIFER

I feel a burden lifted. You know, this whole - deep cover thing - it just wasn't - it wasn't terribly well thought out. Donning this - this Cas mask? This grim face of angelic constipation? It just - ugh. And then, teaming up with you two. I mean, I thought you boys were insufferable as mortal enemies, but working with you. That's the soul crusher.

[Unbeknownst to LUCIFER, SAM manages to get out his knife, and cuts the palm of his hand. DEAN tries to stand up, but LUCIFER telekinetically pins him up against the wall.]

LUCIFER

Why the faces, boys? You should be cheering.

[SAM works on painting a sigil with his blood on the wall behind him while LUCIFER is distracted.]

LUCIFER

We have a common enemy. With this (holds up the Hand of God, still wrapped in cloth), she will be no problem. I mean, I will have killed you both by then, but still. Come on.

[LUCIFER unwraps the Hand of God. DEAN watches him, horror-struck.]

DEAN

No!

[LUCIFER touches the Hand of God, and holds it.]

DEAN

NO!

[LUCIFER closes his eyes as he waits for the effects of the power to come. He frowns when nothing happens. DEAN looks from him to SAM and back, worried and confused.]

LUCIFER

(Angrily) It's kicked!

[A look of slight relief comes over DEAN's face.]

DEAN

Well. Who'd've thought the Hand of God would turn out to be a one-hitter?

[LUCIFER tosses the Hand of God onto the table, and angrily advances toward DEAN, who is still pinned to the wall. At the last second, SAM places his hand on the angel-banishing sigil, and LUCIFER disappears with a yell. SAM and DEAN look at each other, relieved, but also devastated.]

ACT FOUR
[EXTERIOR - AN OLD DOCK - DAY]

[SAM walks over to DEAN who is sitting on an old concrete block, holding the Hand of God and looking miserable.]

SAM

So.

DEAN

So. Cas.

SAM

Yeah. What do we do?

DEAN

What else? We hunt Lucifer, trap the bastard, and save Cas.

SAM

Like I said. Lucifer may be in control now, but Cas may not come back willingly. I mean he chose it.

DEAN

No. No, not possible.

SAM

So how'd you get through today? I mean what did you do?

DEAN

Nothing. Sam, they…

[DEAN stares out over the water as he shakes his head. He looks close to tears.]

DEAN

I was just a witness.

SAM

Do you wanna talk about it?

DEAN

No. No, story for another day.

[SAM stands up.]

DEAN

Hey, the uh - the German ship that sank the Bluefin, what happened to it?

SAM

It went down. Unlike the sub, its wreckage was found. It was a giant hole. It ripped through the entire thing. Something must've hit the fuel tanks and exploded, but it burned. Sank.

[SAM walks off, clapping DEAN on the shoulder. A small, sad smile crosses DEAN's face for a moment, as he looks down at the Hand of God in his hand.]

[FADE TO BLACK]
