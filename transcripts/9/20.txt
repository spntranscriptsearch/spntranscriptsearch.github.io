TEASER

EXT. - NIGHT [A beautiful view of the Chicago skyline. ENNIS ROSS and TAMARA enter IL Secundo, an upscale restaurant.]

♪ Sometimes I'm so high that I just float ♪

INT. - RESTAURANT [Il Secundo, filled with diners.]

TAMARA

This place is beautiful.

ENNIS

Oh, it's all right.

♪ I can't even think about all the darkness ahead ♪

ENNIS

You're beautiful.

TAMARA

Look, Ross, if you think laying it on thick like that's gonna get you somewhere tonight...

ENNIS

I'm right?

TAMARA

...You're totally right. Okay, spill -- why are we here?


♪ But my problem, just the same ♪


ENNIS [getting up to talk to maitre d', MAURICE]

Hold that thought.

♪ As every man, woman and child ♪ ♪ but every good thing must come to an end, move on somehow ♪

MAURICE

Mr. Ross, I hear it's a big night.

ENNIS

Yeah. The biggest.

[He shows MAURICE an engagement ring.]

Can you put this in a glass of champagne? Something nice?

MAURICE [dryly]

How unique.

[MAURICE sees SAL LASSITER and his bodyguard MARV enter, and snubs ENNIS to greet SAL.]

MAURICE

Sal! Hey! Long time no see.

SAL

Too long, Maurice. How you been, man?

MAURICE

Good, how are you doing? Good. Good to see you.

ENNIS

Dude -- man, we were just talking.

MARV

You got a problem?

SAL

Oh, chill out, Marv.

[ENNIS sees MARV's monster face in mirror.]

SAL

It's all good, yeah?

ENNIS

Yeah.

MAURICE

This way, gentlemen. [He leads SAL and MARV towards a private room.]

SAL

How you been?

MAURICE

Good, Mr. Lassiter. Good.

♪ I can't even think about all the darkness ahead ♪

SAL

Sometimes you give, and sometimes you get, huh?

MAURICE

And sometimes you really get.

[MAURICE keys in a code to unlock a door.]

INT. - VIP ROOM

[The bar is filled with well-heeled people.]

SAL

Hey, Mindy. You miss me?

MINDY

Aww. I liked you as a blond.

[SAL runs his hands through his hair and it changes from brown to blond.]

SAL [crosses room filled with various supernatural beings to bartender MINDY]

Better? I hear they have more fun.

SAL [as JULIAN DUVAL approaches]

Hello, Julian. I'm not looking for trouble. I just want a drink.

JULIAN And I want to eat Taylor Swift's heart, but we can't always get what we want. Now get your shifter ass out of here.

[SAL stays at the bar.]

JULIAN

I wasn't asking.

SAL

You werewolves. You're so special, when really you're just sons of bitches.

[MARV chuckles, JULIAN slugs SAL, they tussle and JULIAN starts to turn into a werewolf. They are separated.]

SAL

That all you got?

JULIAN

Oh, trust me, slugger. I got more. So much more.

SAL

Where you goin', old yeller?

[We see a clawed metal hand rip open an electrical panel, and the lights go out. A HOODED FIGURE enters and begins punching people out. He slashes MARV and SAL and they fall.]

EXT. - NIGHT - FERRY LANDING

[TAMARA and ENNIS run down the stairs to the ferry landing, laughing.]

TAMARA

Ennis! Where are we going?

ENNIS

That place -- it wasn't us.

TAMARA

So, you dragged me to a ferry stop, why?

ENNIS

We met on a ferry. That field trip -- 5th grade -- you had your hair in braids, and... And I couldn't take my eyes off you. Tam, this is us. So...[ENNIS takes an engagement ring from his pocket.]

TAMARA

Oh, my God!

[SAL comes down the stairs, hand over his bleeding gut]

SAL

Call 911! Call 911!

[SAL falls and ENNIS goes to him.]

SAL

David... I'm sorry.

ENNIS

David? Who's David?

SAL

I didn't have a choice.

[TAMARA screams as the HOODED FIGURE slams her against a wall. Her head is cracked open and she falls, dead.]

ENNIS

Tamara! Tamara!

[The HOODED FIGURE slashes SAL again, kills him. ENNIS runs to TAMARA.]

ENNIS

No! Ahh! No! No! No... Please... Please... No!


ACT ONE

EXT.- NORTH CHICAGO UNIVERSITY CAMPUS, DAYTIME

[Students walking across campus.]

CUT TO INT. - OFFICE

[The door reads "Office of Professor W.L. GRAHAM, Mathematics Department Chair." PROF. GRAHAM enters his office, where he sees his ASSISTANT, a young woman, filing.]

ASSISTANT

Professor? What are you doing here?

GRAHAM

Uh, my office. Why aren't you at lunch?

ASSISTANT

Paperwork. I thought you and your wife had gone away for the weekend.

GRAHAM

We have -- we are. I just forgot something. Don't worry about it.

[GRAHAM enters his interior office, closes the door, starts to answer his buzzing phone, sees the caller ID "MARGO," and hits ignore. He inserts a USB into a desktop computer and begins copying a file labeled "SPRING FINALS." GRAHAM shifts into DAVID LASSITER and makes a call.]

DAVID

Matt? It's David Lassiter. Spread the word -- I've got answers to the math final. 50 bucks a pop.

EXT - CAMPUS - DAYTIME.

[DAVID is leaving the building. MARGO calls again, and he answers.]

DAVID

Teddy's House of Piñatas, Cinnamon speaking.

MARGO LASSITER's voice

Not funny, David. Where the hell are you?! You need to come home.

DAVID

Margo. Margo. Slow down.

MARGO's voice

David, listen to me. You have to come home now.

DAVID

What do you mean?

MARGO's voice

It's about Sal.

DAVID

What about Sal?

MARGO'S voice

Our brother's dead.

CUT TO INT. - POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM

[ENNIS is at the table. We don't yet see who he's talking to.]

ENNIS

I know what I saw.

DETECTIVE FREDDIE COSTA

And you're sure? I mean...sure? 'Cause, what you're tellin' me... About this faceless whatever-it-is?

ENNIS

That thing had claws.

FREDDIE

Look, maybe you got confused. You know, maybe -- maybe it was some banger with a knife.

ENNIS

I know what I saw.

FREDDIE

I am trying to help.

ENNIS

By calling me a liar?!

FREDDIE

Wow. You are just like your old man. Nate Ross was a great cop. He taught me everything I know. But his temper never did him any favors. Look, you had a tough break, losin' your dad as young as you did. And I have done all I can to help. But if you go off half-cocked, spouting this monster crap or doing something stupid, I can't help you anymore, Ennis.

ENNIS

I know what I saw.

[ENTER SAM and DEAN]

DEAN

Agents Bonham and Peart, FBI. We will take it from here.

FREDDIE

Like hell you will. Since when did the Feeb start working stabbings?

DEAN

Listen, uh, Detective... Your, uh, perp fits a certain profile. Now, I could go into detail, but I'm -- I'm not going to.

[DEAN has led FREDDIE out of the room. DEAN closes the door.]

SAM (to ENNIS)

All right. Let's talk about last night.

ENNIS

Why? So you can call me crazy, too?

DEAN

Try us.

ENNIS [has apparently told most of the story]

And when I got to her... She...She --

SAM

There is nothing you could've done.

ENNIS

That supposed to make me feel better? Look, this thing wasn't human. So what are you gonna do about it?

DEAN

I don't know what to tell you, kid. There's no such thing as monsters.

[SAM and Dean leave.]

CUT TO EXT. - LASSITER RESIDENCE - DAYTIME

FREDDIE o.s.

Margo, calm down.

MARGO o.s.

Don't tell me to calm down, Detective. Just tell me -- the ghouls, are they with us?

CUT TO INT. - LASSITER RESIDENCE

FREDDIE

Maybe.

MARGO

Maybe? We don't pay you for "maybe", Freddie. Cut to the chase.

FREDDIE

All right. Well, with your pop the way he is and now that Sal's gone... The families have concerns.

MARGO

Tell the ghouls, the Djinn, and whoever I run this family now. So they can either back us, or I'll bend 'em over, jam a .45 elbow deep, and empty the damn clip.

DAVID [coming downstairs]

Margo.

MARGO

You actually came.

FREDDIE

Welcome home, David. Hey, I'm sorry about Sal. He was a -- he was a good one.

DAVID

What happened to him?

MARGO

Julian Duval happened. He and Sal had words in the backroom of Il Secundo, then the wolf circled around and tore that place apart. He clawed out Sal's heart, and he will bleed for that.

[They all walk into another room. where a couple of big guys are handling a bunch of weapons.]

FREDDIE (to David)

Maybe you can talk some sense into her. 'cause I sure as hell can't.

DAVID

Margo? What's with the N.R.A. Christmas in here? What are you doing?

MARGO

We're going to war. You don't like it, talk to dad.

[CUT to yet another room, where we see a hospital vitals monitor, a nurse, and a man unconscious in bed wearing a cannula.]


DAVID

I didn't know Pop was this bad.

MARGO

You've been gone three years. Things change.

DAVID [as they leave sickroom]

Margo, are you sure it was Julian?!

MARGO

Costa's got a witness.

DAVID

That saw Julian?

MARGO

He hated Sal. You knew it, I knew it --the whole damn city knew it. The dick saw his shot, and he took it.

DAVID

That's a "no."

MARGO

The mutt gutted our brother!

DAVID

You don't know that! And if the werewolves did this --

MARGO

If?! Look at you -- falling all over yourself to defend the family that's had their foot on our neck for years. Oh, it's just like old times. Oh, by the way... Your ex is getting married. You know that, right? Violet? Her father pimped her out to the New York wolves to seal some deal.

DAVID

I'm not saying don't fight. I'm saying be smart. Find out what happened. And if Julian did this --

MARGO

Yeah, you'll what? David, come on. You don't want this. You ran away to be a human. You always had a soft spot for 'em. Look, you're out. Stay out.

EXT. - DUVAL ESTATE - DAYTIME

CUT TO INT. - DUVAL ESTATE

[JULIAN is pouring drink. A male DJINN sits in a chair.]

JULIAN

You're sure I can't get you anything? Bourbon? Blood?

DJINN

I'm fine. Do you really think the shifters will make a move? Margo is not stupid.

[ENTER VIOLET]

VIOLET

Julian.

JULIAN

Not now, Violet.

VIOLET

We need to talk. Please.

[They go into hallway]

VIOLET

I just heard --Sal Lassiter's dead.

JULIAN

Oh, dear. Whatever shall I do?

VIOLET

Did you kill him?

JULIAN

No. From the look of his body, Sal died quick.

VIOLET

Wait, you saw his body?

JULIAN

I'm thorough, aren't I?

VIOLET

Then who killed him?

JULIAN

Like I care.

VIOLET

Why are you meeting with the Djinn?

JULIAN

Because that whore Margo Lassiter wants me dead. She thinks I sliced up her brother, and I'm not gonna tell her any different. After what those shifters have done -- chipping away at our territory, insulting us... There's a war coming. And I need Tattoos in there on my side.

VIOLET

Wait, Julian, stop --

JULIAN [handling her roughly]

What do you think you're doing?! You're the bitch in this pack, princess. Your job is to be pretty and silent. So war, no war -- you don't get a vote.

CROSSFADE to EXT. - EL PLATFORM - DAYTIME

[ENNIS exits the train, walks to his somewhat rundown house]

♪ Little black submarines, operator, please ♪ ♪ put me back on the line ♪ told my girl I'd be back, operator, please ♪ ♪ this is wreckin' my mind ♪

[ENNIS enters a run down house, looks in closet, opens a trunk labeled N. ROSS. There is a photo of his dad in cop dress uniform inside. along with revolver and, hidden in box, silver bullets with something carved in them.]

♪ oh, can it be the voices calling me ♪ ♪ they get lost and out of time ♪ ♪ I should've seen it glow, but everybody knows ♪ ♪ that a broken heart is blind ♪ ♪ that a broken heart is blind ♪

CUT to EXT. FERRY LANDING - DAYTIME

[A crime scene is being investigated as ENNIS looks down. HE flashes back to memory of Tamara being killed.]

ENNIS (flashback)

No! No! Tamara!

[Back in the present, ENNIS breaks into the back room of Il Secundo. He sees broken glass, claw marks, blood. ENNIS hides when he hears someone enter. It is MAURICE, pushing a janitor's bucket and mop. MAURICE sniffs out ENNIS. ENNIS gets up, points his gun at MAURICE.]

ENNIS

Chicago P.D.! Stay right where you are!

MAURICE

I don't think so.

[MAURICE bares vamp teeth]

ENNIS

What the...?

[AS MAURICE is about to attack ENNIS, something cuts MAURICE's head off. We see it is DEAN, holding a bloody machete. SAM is with him.]


ACT TWO [Continues previous scene]

DEAN

He looks better with a little off the top, don't you think? You wan to run, now's the time.

ENNIS

I'm not going anywhere until someone tells me what the hell's going on.

DEAN

You should go.

ENNIS

No.

DEAN

All right, Sammy, give him the talk.

SAM

All right, look, my name is Sam Winchester. That's my brother Dean. We, uh... ...we kill vampires. And werewolves, and demons, and -- basically, we chase down evil... And we cut its head off.

ENNIS

So you're, what, monster cops?

DEAN

Hunters.

ENNIS

Then what killed my girlfriend?

DEAN

We're working on it, okay? And from what you told us, uh, this thing sounds new... or Freddy Krueger.

ENNIS

W-what about that guy I saw in the mirror? With -- with the messed-up face?

SAM

It's probably a wraith. Look, a lot of these things, they can look human until you catch them in a mirror or sometimes a camera.

ENNIS

So -- so you find this -- this whatever, a-and you're -- you're gonna chop its head off?

SAM

Yeah, or sometimes, when in doubt, try a silver bullet.

DEAN

Hey, Sammy.

SAM

Yep?

DEAN [looking inside of cabinet]

This is full of -- of blood and meat. A lot of meat. Actually, this one, uh... This one's labeled "Susan."

SAM

What is this, some kind of backroom...

ENNIS

Monster V.I.P.

DEAN

Yeah, well, if it is and Sal Lassiter was here...

SAM

Then he's not human.

DEAN

So, what, we got monsters killing monsters now?

SAM

Maybe. We got to see the body.

ENNIS

I'm coming with you.

DEAN

No. You're gonna stay.

ENNIS

Or what? Huh? You gonna hurt me? Kill the girl I love? Ruin my damn life?! Yeah, you're too late.

SAM

Ennis, listen. I get it. Believe me, I've been there. But what we do? It's messed up. So do yourself a favor and stay out. You can get hurt, too.

DEAN

Okay.

[SAM and DEAN exit.]

CUT to quick shot of El train, then INT. - ENNIS' HOUSE

[Ennis looks at a picture of TAMARA, then to some information he pulled up about SAL LASSITER on computer. SAL was a vice president of a blood management business. ENNIS looks at his silver bullet. There's a knock on the door. It's FREDDIE COSTA.]

FREDDIE

Hey. Can we talk?

ENNIS

About what?

FREDDIE

Last night. This thing you think killed Tamara, what'd it look like?

ENNIS

Thing? You said it was "some banger with a knife."

FREDDIE [entering house]

Chasing down every lead, kid.

ENNIS

Like I told you, it didn't have much of a face.

FREDDIE

He -- it -- whatever -- say anything?

ENNIS

I told you that, too.

FREDDIE

Then tell me again.

ENNIS

Hey, if you got the time, why don't you hang around? Dad's working the graveyard, but he'll be home soon. And he'd love to see you.

FREDDIE

Sure. Be good to see him, too.

ENNIS

Sorry. Text.

[ENNIS activates phone camera, sees FREDDIE's weird eyes.]

FREDDIE

No worries. Look, Ennis. I, uh... I know this is hard.

ENNIS

See, uh, that thing slashed up my jacket pretty good. Forensics went over it, but -- well, you want to see?

FREDDIE

That'd be great.

[They go into dad's room. ENNIS grabs the gun.]

FREDDIE

I appreciate this, kid. Really.

[ENNIS tosses the jacket to distract FREDDIE and aims the gun at him.]

ENNIS

Hey. Look, there's a silver bullet in this gun!

FREDDIE

Ennis. Ennis, don't --

ENNIS

you're not Freddie Costa, so who are you?!

FREDDIE (DAVID) [shifting]

My name is David Lassiter. I'm a shapeshifter.

ENNIS

You're a what?!

DAVID

We shift...our shape. Um, it's kinda all there in the name. Sal Lassiter was my brother. I'm just trying to find out who killed him.

ENNIS

So you slap on somebody else's face, huh?!

DAVID

It's kind of my go-to. Look, I read the police report. I know you lost someone, too.

ENNIS

Oh, shut up! See, you don't talk about her!

DAVID

You know what's going on out there? Do you have any idea?

ENNIS

Freaks. Hunters. Yeah, I got the basics.

DAVID

Wow. You are so in over your head. Let me give you the short version. Chicago is divided up between five monster families.

ENNIS

What? Is that a joke?

DAVID

Do you hear a laugh track?

ENNIS

What about the police?

DAVID

We own the police. Look, I'm talking shakedowns, organ trafficking. The werewolves running the Gold Coast, the Djinn owning the South Side. But we want to keep a low profile, so...We keep the peace. And human casualties to a minimum.

ENNIS

A minimum?

DAVID

Look, I don't like it either, okay? But you know what's behind door #2? War. That's blood -- human and monster -- in the street. And right now? There's exactly one guy trying to stop it.

ENNIS

Wow. You know, good for you. I'd slow clap, but, well, my hands are a little full.

DAVID

Just stay out of it, okay? These cuts are flecked with silver.

ENNIS

How do you know?

DAVID

Because it burns.

ENNIS

So?

DAVID

Julian Duval hasn't got silver claws. He's a werewolf.

[DAVID tosses jacket over ENNIS' head to distract him, runs away.]

ENNIS

Hey! Hey!

[ENNIS chases DAVID out of the house, but can't find him]


ACT THREE

INT. - ENNIS' HOUSE.

[ENNIS looks up JULIAN DUVAL online.]

CUT TO EXT. - DUVAL ESTATE - NIGHT.

[ENNIS is approaching the Duval estate. SAM and DEAN don't see him yet.]

SAM

So, get this. The, uh, coroner says this guy, this, uh, Julian Duval, shows up, drops 3 grand to see Sal's corpse.

[ENNIS overhears them]

DEAN

And he lives in a friggin' castle. Who is this guy?

SAM

Well, if we're lucky, someone who knows what happened to that monster boy.

CUT TO VIOLET leaving DUVAL MANSION.

BUTLER

Madame.

VIOLET

You can cut the act, David.

DAVID [shifts]

How did you --

VIOLET

I know you.

DAVID

Yeah, well, ditto.

VIOLET

Is the real butler okay?

DAVID

He's resting. Locked in a closet.

VIOLET

You shouldn't be here.

DAVID

You think I want to be here? It's about Sal.

VIOLET

I heard. I'm so sorry. Julian didn't do it.

DAVID

Yeah, I know. That's why I need you to talk your brother, get him to a have a sit-down with Margo, so they can just work this crap out.

VIOLET

There's no way that's happening.

DAVID

We can stop a war, Violet.

VIOLET

One, Julian doesn't want to stop this, and second, how? You're a runaway and I'm... I'm a bitch. We don't matter.

DAVID

What's wrong with you? Since when do you play their game? And since when do you let your dad sell you to some dick from New York?

VIOLET

You think I had a choice?!

DAVID

You did! Union Station. Midnight. You had a choice. You -- you're the one who said we should go away, live a normal life. You set the time, the place... And I was there. Where were you?

[HOODED FIGURE jumps DAVID from the roof.]

DAVID

Run!

[DAVID and HOODED FIGURE wrestle. HOODED FIGURE has just started burning DAVID with silver claws when HOODED FIGURE is shot, by ENNIS. DAVID runs, hears VIOLET scream. DAVID runs, ENNIS follows.]

DAVID

Violet! Violet!

[DEAN and SAM arrive. DEAN has his gun drawn.]

DEAN

What the hell's going on?!

DAVID

It took her.

SAM

Wait, who are you?

ENNIS

His name's David Lassiter. He's a shapeshifter.

[An alarm goes off and guards have come out of the Duval house.]

DEAN

Hey, we got to go. Now! Let's go!

CUT TO IMPALA - NIGHT - RAIN.

[ENNIS and DAVID are in the back.]

DEAN

All right, everybody out. [They all get out of the car.] So you're tellin' me there are five monster families that run Chicago? What is this, "The Godfather" with fangs?

ENNIS

Well, if it is, I'm gonna need all the help I can get.

DEAN

Well, he doesn't quit. I'll give him that.

DAVID

Violet's not picking up.

SAM

Wait, so this girl, she a shifter, too?

DAVID

Werewolf.

DEAN and ENNIS, together

Awesome. Awesome.

ENNIS

If she has her cell, we could trace the signal.

SAM

Yeah, you might be right. All right. What's her number?

DAVID

Take me with you, and it's all yours.

ENNIS

No! Oh, hell no! Dude, he's a freakin' transformer.

DEAN

And sometimes you got to work with the bad guys to get to the worse guys.

DAVID

Dude, I'm right here.

DEAN

Yeah, I see you.

[They all get back in the car and drive off.]

CUT TO INT., A ROOM. Creepy wall of photos and clippings. [VIOLET is chained to a pole. She comes to.]

HOODED GUY (IRV SOKOLOWSKI)

You think I'm some freak... Like you. But I'm not. I'm just a man... With some fun little toys.

[He removes his mask, etc., and extends his silver "claws."]


ACT FOUR

EXT. - NIGHT - CHICAGO. Skyline in background. [The Impala pulls up to a creepy building and SAM, DEAN, DAVID, and ENNIS get out.]

SAM

Signal's coming from in there.

DAVID

Hey. Thanks for...You know. And about your girlfriend, I'm --

ENNIS

Look, I don't need no apology from you.

DAVID

I lost someone, too, okay?! But I'm trying here.

ENNIS

I'm sorry about your brother. He spoke about you at the end. He said, "David, I'm sorry. I didn't have a choice."

DEAN

All right, you guys can kiss and make up later. We got work to do. Come on.

CUT TO IRV's ROOM

IRV

Silver. It burns if you're evil. If you're a monster.

[He burns VIOLET and she flinches. She tries to turn away from the photos and clippings but he turns her face back.]

IRV

No! No! You look at him! He was my son. And your brother and the shifter, Lassiter... They ripped him apart. The police told me that it was a wild animal. And I believed them for years. But now I know the truth.

VIOLET

Please, Sal and Julian hated each other, and neither of them would hurt a kid.

IRV

Why should I believe you? You're dead. Tomorrow, they will find pieces of you all over town. Oh, won't the doggies be mad?

VIOLET

That's what you want. You're trying to start a war.

IRV

When freaks start killin' freaks we win.

VIOLET

No. Once this starts, do you have any idea how many people -- how many children will die?

[A noise. CUT TO DAVID, ENNIS, SAM and DEAN in some kind of tunnel.]

DEAN (to DAVID)

All right, you're with me, Romeo.

DAVID

Sounds good, Buffy.

[SAM and ENNIS go one way, DEAN and DAVID go the other. Something catches DAVID in a trap.]

DEAN

Kid? David?!

CUT TO IRV's ROOM. [Now DAVID is chained up, too.]

DAVID

I'm so sorry, Violet.

IRV

Guess I'm gonna have to make an example of you, too.

VIOLET

No!

DAVID

Don't hurt her!

IRV

Why?! Hmm?! 'Cause she's your girlfriend? Hmm? Yeah, I heard you talking. Real sweet. Hell, it was almost human. Almost.

[IRV cuts DAVID with claw while VIOLET transforms into her wolf.]

IRV

Here's the thing -- you can look human and act human... But deep down? You're just a monster.

[VIOLET breaks free, attacks IRV. DAVID breaks free.]

DAVID

Violet, no! Please! Please! Violet. Please.

[VIOLET stops, turns back to her human form. DAVID holds her.]

DAVID

It's all right. It's all right.

[SAM, DEAN, and ENNIS show up, weapons drawn, as IRV starts to get up.]

DEAN

What'd we miss?

IRV (to ENNIS)

I know you. I'm sorry about your girl. But she was in the way. You understand. I know you do. They're monsters!

ENNIS

I only see one monster here.

[ENNIS shoots, kills IRV.]


ACT FIVE

EXT. - DUVAL ESTATE - DAY [DAVID and VIOLET are walking.]

DAVID

You all right?

VIOLET

I will be. Are you?

DAVID

I'll get back to you on that. Sal -- he said he was sorry. Those were his last words -- "David, I'm sorry. I didn't have a choice." But Sal never did anything to me. Why would he say that?

[FLASHBACK to VIOLET in Union Station, presumably to meet with DAVID. She sees SAL.]

VIOLET

Sal, what are you do-- He's not coming, is he?

SAL

David'll be here in a few minutes. You won't be.

VIOLET

Why are you doing this?

SAL

'Cause he's my little brother, Violet. It's my job to protect him. It's my job to keep our blood pure.

VIOLET

You believe that bloodline crap?

SAL

We all do. Bloodlines -- everyone knowing our place. It's the one thing we all agree on. If your people find out you ran off with a shifter, they'll be lookin' for payback. And they'll come after my family. And then it's nothin' but bad times and dead bodies on both sides. David wants to go straight, that's his call. But he does it alone. So you have a choice, Violet -- you could either walk out of here alive... ...or I'll take you out and dump what's left of you in the lake.

VIOLET

Sal? I love him.

SAL

I wish that mattered.

[FLASH FORWARD TO THE PRESENT]

DAVID

Even after I left the family, I knew if things got bad that Sal would always have my back. So... What did he mean?

VIOLET

I don't know. I should go.

DAVID

Sure, right. That's what you do best.

VIOLET

David...

[They kiss passionately and VIOLET runs to the house]

CUT TO LASSITER HOUSE - SICKROOM

DAVID

Pop? What?

LASSITER

Your sister -- she wants war. You have to stop her.

CUT TO ANOTHER ROOM IN THE LASSITER HOUSE [DAVID lays IRV's silver claw on a table in front of MARGO.]

DAVID

All this was some... Messed-up guy. The Duvals are clean.

MARGO

Fine. We done?

DAVID

And I'm coming back to the family.

MARGO

I thought you were out.

DAVID

Well, now I'm back in.

MARGO

I've waited a long time to hear you say that. Welcome home, David.

CUT TO ENNIS' HOUSE, DAY [The Impala is pulling up in front of the house.]

SAM (to ENNIS)

You live here alone?

ENNIS

My sister's on the other side of town, my mom's out of the picture, and my dad... Well, he died. Line of duty. A long time ago.

DEAN

I'm sorry to hear that.

[DEAN's phone rings, he answers.]

DEAN on phone

Yeah?

ENNIS (to SAM)

So, what's next?

SAM

Nothing, you're done.

DEAN (on phone)

Okay. We're on our way. Yeah.

SAM (to ENNIS)

Just give me a second.

SAM (to DEAN)

- Yeah?

DEAN

- We've got a gig.

SAM

You want to leave? Dean, this city is crawling with monsters.

DEAN
