NOW
[Polk City, IA. Night, outside a public restroom facility in Big Creek State Park, inside the only car parked in the isolated lot in the woods, two teens are making out and hear a strange whistling noise]

BARBARA: What was that?

TOM: It was nothing. Just the wind.

[the whistling song continues]

BARBARA: Okay, that -- that wasn't the wind.

TOM: I'll check it out.

[as Tom is about to get out of the car, the sheriff opens the door for him]

SHERIFF ROMERO: What are you guys doing?

TOM: Dad?

SHERIFF ROMERO: Barbara.

BARBARA: Hi, Sheriff.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Do your parents know where you are right now?

TOM: Why do you care?

SHERIFF ROMERO: You're supposed to be studying.

TOM: At Mom's. This is not your weekend. Besides, she's --

SHERIFF ROMERO: Out of town. With Todd. I know. She called you. You weren't home. She called me. She's worried.

TOM: Well, you found me. Good for you.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Hey. Watch it.

TOM: Or what?

[Barbara makes herself presentable and gets out of the car, heading toward the restrooms]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Hey, where you going?

BARBARA: Um...bathroom. You guys need some space.

[she turns on the light in the abandoned-looking bathroom and the lights flicker, and she reacts with disgust to what she discovers in the stalls]

BARBARA: Ugh. Oh, God.

[outside, at Tom's car]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Tom, you shouldn't be out here. But I didn't mean to embarrass you.

TOM: Yeah, you never do.

[inside the bathroom, Barbara finds a stall that isn't completely objectionable and resigns herself to using it. The lights begin to flicker and the whistling noise is coming from inside the bathroom, along with heavy footsteps and a growling noise. A monstrous hand reaches over the stall door and she screams. Tom and Sheriff Romero hear her from outside and rush to her aid]

TOM: Barbara?!

SHERIFF ROMERO: Stay here.

[Sheriff Romero barges into the bathroom, gun drawn, and finds her purse on the floor of the stall, but Barbara is gone. He runs out of the bathroom and into the woods, and Tom follows after him]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Barbara! Barbara! Barbara?

[The sheriff sees a figure moving through the shadows in the woods, but trips in the dark and loses sight of it]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Hey!

[when he gets up again, he hears Thomas yelling in the distance and runs toward the sound]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Thomas! Thomas!

[Tom drops to his knees, sobbing over Barbara's body.]

TOM: No! No! No...

TITLE CARD
ACT 1
[in the Bunker kitchen, Sam sits at the table with his computer when Dean comes in to get coffee]

DEAN: Morning, sunshine.

SAM: Hey.

DEAN: What you looking at? Porn? Sex tapes? Nip slips?

SAM: The Internet is more than just naked people. You do know that, right?

DEAN: Not my Internet.

SAM: All right. Check this out. So, this girl -- her body was found just outside Big Creek State Park in Iowa. Uh, covered in bite marks. The police are saying it's an animal attack.

DEAN: But...?

SAM: But I did some digging, and I found that there weren't a lot of bodies, but a lot of people do go missing in that park. Look at this. Park ranger back in '06. A poacher in '98. And on and on and on. I mean, I've only gone back to 1943, and I've already found 54 missing people.

DEAN: Wow.

SAM: Yeah.

DEAN: Yeah. Sounds like our kind of thing. You sure you're up for it? I mean, I know you wanted to take some time.

SAM: No, I-I'm -- I'm good. Honestly, I-I'm good.

DEAN: All right. Well, let's hit it.

SAM: You got it. I'll grab Cas.

DEAN: Mm. He actually left.

SAM: What?

DEAN: Early this morning.

SAM: Why?

DEAN: I don't know. Something about being cooped up in the bunker for a few weeks. We all need to stretch our legs. I get it.

SAM: All right. Uh, then, Jack.

DEAN: Uh... I don't want Jack on this.

SAM: I thought you said Donatello gave him the all clear?

DEAN: Yeah, he did. And I'm -- I'm sure he's good. But... Jack's got his mojo back. His powers have gotten us in trouble in the past -- the security guard. So I just want to make sure that, you know, he's right before we put him back out there.

SAM: Yeah. Yeah.


[In the bunker library, Jack is reading a book when Sam and Dean come to tell him they're going out on a hunt]

DEAN: Hey, uh...good reading?

JACK: Yes. Did you know Article 246 of the Haitian criminal code officially makes it against the law to turn a human into a zombie?

DEAN: Good.

SAM: Jack, listen. Dean and I are heading out on a case.

JACK: And...you don't want me to come?

SAM: Look, truth is --

DEAN: We don't want to leave the bunker empty. In case, uh, Mom or... some of the other Hunters call and need help, so... And this place is long overdue for a restock. So, uh, your mission, should you choose to accept -- made you a list.

[Dean hands Jack a handwritten grocery list]

JACK: My mission is shopping? [Jack reads from the list] Beer, TP, eggs... beer again.

SAM: Twice?

DEAN: Yeah.

JACK: I'll do it.

DEAN: Great! We'll be in touch.


[In Sheriff Romero's office, he pours himself coffee while Sam and Dean talk to him]

SHERIFF ROMERO: I'm sorry. I just don't really see how this is an FBI thing.

DEAN: Wildlife preserve is government property. We're the government.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Yeah, well, it is a large piece of land -- coyotes, rough terrain. We try to limit hikers to the trails, but some of them don't listen.

SAM: Okay, but the girl who died, she wasn't a hiker.

DEAN: Do you know what happened to her?

SHERIFF ROMERO: Like I said, coyotes.

SAM: You know, do you mind if we take a look at the body?

SHERIFF ROMERO: Do I have a choice?

DEAN: Not really.


[Sam and Dean go to the morgue to inspect Barbara's body. As they pull the drawer out, her arm rolls free and flops off the table, hitting Dean. He jumps back in surprise.]

DEAN: Whoa! Mo--

SAM: Seriously? How long you been doing this?

DEAN: Well, got catlike reflexes, okay? What can I say?

[They examine the wounds on her neck and arm, which are long, deep scratches]

DEAN: Said a coyote did this?

SAM: Not even close.

DEAN: Mnh-mnh.

SAM: Look at the skin around the bite. It looks...burnt.

DEAN: So, what the hell can do that?


[in Lebanon, Jack walks up to the store and discovers it's closed, with an Out To Lunch sign taped to the door. He checks his phone, looks around, and begins pacing on the sidewalk. A car pulls up with Stacy driving, Max in the passenger seat, and Eliot in back. Eliot is playing an episode of Ghostfacers on his phone]

♪ We face them all, ghost! Ghostfacers! ♪ ♪ We face the faceless, we face the dead! ♪

STACY: Eliot, stop.

ELIOT: What? The Ghostfacers are cool.

STACY: No. They're really not.

Pure power at hand...

[they spot Jack standing in front of the store]

MAX: Uh... Is that what's his name? Bambi?

STACY: Hey!

JACK: Hello.

STACY: Are you lost?

JACK: Um... no.

Shoot that ghost right in the face! Boo-yah! Winchesters still suck ass, though. Affirmative.

ELIOT: You live with Sam and Dean, right? They're not here right now. Are they fighting ghosts?!

JACK: What's a ghost? I should go.

MAX: Hey, it's...cool. We know. About their whole Hunter thing.

JACK: Oh. Good. I don't like to lie. It makes my stomach hurt. Like when you have to burp, but you can't burp. Yeah.

STACY: So, you need something?

JACK: I do, but the store's closed.

STACY: Not anymore.

[She pulls out the keys to the store]


[At the Sheriff's office in Polk City, Tom enters his father's office]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Hey! Come in. You okay?

[flashback to Barbara's body in the woods]

TOM: No. I think I should talk to them.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Who?

TOM: Barbara's parents.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Tom, that's not a good idea. I've already spoken to them. They're grieving.

TOM: Dad. This was my fault.

SHERIFF ROMERO: That's not true.

TOM: Yes, it is.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Tom, they just need a little time. We all do.


[inside the store in Lebanon, Jack shops while Stacy and Max talk by the register]

STACY: I feel... bad for him.

MAX: Same. I mean, living with a bunch of dudes. Their whole place must smell like beer, Kleenex, and Old Spice.

[Eliot stands in the aisle, and approaches Jack as he finishes shopping and they walk to the register]

ELIOT: I've been watching these guys called the Ghostfacers. You heard of 'em?

JACK: No.

ELIOT: They're awesome! They know all about ghosts, and I'm reading books.

JACK: Oh, I like books, too. I'm reading about zombies.

ELIOT: Zombies are real?

JACK: Well, no. Not really. It's kind of disappointing. But there are other monsters.

ELIOT: Like what?

JACK: Oh, vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters -- I've seen one of those -- djinn, rugaru -- That's a funny name. Yeah. Wraiths, sirens, demons, ghouls. All sorts of things.

ELIOT: And you know about all of them?

JACK: Well...yes.

ELIOT: Jack, will you be my best friend?

STACY: Dude, stop stalking him. Sorry. Ever since he found out about this stuff, he's been obsessed.

JACK: It's fine.

MAX: Do you ever, like, hang out?

JACK: Well, we have movie nights on Tuesdays. Dean usually picks. I've seen "Lost Boys" like 36 times.

MAX: I mean with kids your own age.

JACK: Well, I'm two. ...enty. I'm twenty. Two. I'm twenty two.

STACY: Okay. Well, we're going to the Stoke place tomorrow, if you wanna chill.

MAX: It's this old farmhouse outside of town. No one goes there.

ELIOT: So we can talk about monsters.

STACY: And other non-freak things.

JACK: I... I think I'd like that.

STACY: It's $37.08. But for the beer, I need to see some ID.

JACK: ID?


[night, inside the Sheriff's Office, Sam sits at a desk in the squad room researching online, and Dean sits in an office behind him looking through files]

SAM: Kohonta.

DEAN: Gesundheit.

SAM: No, not -- Kohonta. It's a -- It's a local Native American legend. I can't find much about it, but they're sort of... twisted monsters that roam the woods "driven to consume sweet mortal flesh."

DEAN: You think this is our Hot Lips?

SAM: Could be. I mean, according to the lore, Kohonta get so starving, they spit up stomach acid.

DEAN: Mm. Gross.

SAM: Yeah. If that is our monster, it's old... and... hungry.


[in the woods, in the dark, a couple -- Fitz and Sara -- hikes, carrying flashlights]

FITZ: How much longer?

SARA: Keep up, old man.

[they hear whistling in the distance]

FITZ: What was that?

SARA: Nothing. It's just the wind.

[the melodic whistling continues]

FITZ: We should head back.

[he turns back the way they came and he sees a shadowy figure lurking nearby, watching them]

FITZ: Sara?

[She turns around and joins him, shining her flashlight toward the figure]

SARA: Hey! Who the hell are you?! I'm talking to you, freak! I --

[the figure moves, and they see its monstrous, vine-covered face. Sara screams as the monster growls, and they try to flee. Fitz trips and falls]

FITZ: Sara, run!

[Sara runs, but the monster catches Fitz and drools on his face, burning him, before killing him]

ACT 2
[at the Sheriff's office the next morning, the sheriff flips through Barbara's file and crime scene photos]

TOM: Hey, did you know when some animals get a taste of people, that's all they'll want to hunt? I mean, I'm reading on here that tigers, even bears --

SHERIFF ROMERO: Tom, you've got to stop.

TOM: You won't let me talk to Barbara's parents. I have to do something. You said it was a coyote, right?

[the sheriff flashes back to what he saw that night, the same monster we just saw kill Fitz]

SHERIFF ROMERO [in his flashback]: Barbara!

[back in his office with Tom]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Yeah. It was.

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY: Sheriff, there's a... situation at Big Creek.

[Sheriff Romero starts to leave with the deputy, but Tom stops him before he can leave]

TOM: It got somebody else, didn't it?

[the sheriff gives Tom a grim look, but says nothing]


[at the crime scene in the woods, Sam and Dean interview Sara in the back of an ambulance]

SARA: But did -- did they find him?

DEAN: No, not yet.

SAM: Sara, what did you see out there?

SARA: There was this guy. I think...it was a guy. He looked like he was covered in something. And... he was whistling. I ran, but Fitz, he...

SAM: Can you tell us exactly where you were when this thing attacked you?

SARA: I think... a few miles past the old Parker cabin.

DEAN: Parker?

[Sheriff Romero pulls up, tooting the siren of his police car]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Okay, wrap it up!

DEPUTY: Sheriff, we've got a search party out there.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Not anymore. You're bringing everybody in. Now.

DEAN: What's going on?

SHERIFF ROMERO: What does it look like? We're done here. I'm not wasting time and money hunting for a rabid coyote.

SAM: Okay, Sheriff, this wasn't an animal attack.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Then what was it?

DEAN: Look, if you want to pull your men out of there, that's fine. But we still need to get in there.

SHERIFF ROMERO: It's not happening. Look, I don't care if you guys are the FBI. Nobody goes in those woods without my say-so. Understood?

DEAN: Mm-hmm.

SAM: Hm.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Good.

DEPUTY [talking into his phone in the background as the sheriff walks away]: He wants us to call off...

DEAN: Well, we should probably do what he says.

SAM: Oh, yeah. Definitely.

MAN ON RADIO: We're done.


[At the farmhouse, Stacy studies for the SAT and Max looks at her phone on the sofa, listening to music]

♪ It was love ♪ ♪ It was real ♪

STACY: I'm gonna fail. I'm gonna fail the SATs.

MAX: No way. I mean, you get 400 points just for spelling your name right.

STACY: Mmm.

MAX: So, I mean... you'll at least get that. Probably. Maybe.

STACY: Shut up!

MAX: It's not my fault you're so cute when you're angry.

[they lean into each other, about to kiss]

♪ It was love ♪ ♪ It was real ♪

[Eliot interrupts from the table in the next room, reading a book called Monsters Myth & Magik]

ELIOT: If you two are going to kiss, can you go to the other room?

[Stacy and Max make faces at him, Max sticks out her tongue]

MAX: Myeh!

STACY: Hmm...

ELIOT: I'm trying to work here.

STACY: Okay. Chill.

[there's a knock on the door]

STACY: Come in.

[Jack enters carrying a stack of books from the bunker and sets them down next to Eliot's books]

ELIOT: Jack. You came.

JACK: Yeah. You invited me.

STACY: Yeah. We know.

ELIOT: Are these --

JACK: Books. On monsters.

ELIOT: Awesome.

[Eliot sorts through the books while Jack looks around. Stacy is back to studying while Max rests against her shoulder. Jack listens to the song that's playing]

♪ ...again. Can you teach me how to love again? ♪

JACK: What's that?

MAX: Music?

JACK: I like The Who.

STACY: Who?

MAX: Oh, my aunt listens to them. They're... old.

JACK: Well, Dean says any music made after 1979 "sucks ass."

MAX: That's because Dean is also old.

STACY: Sit down.

♪ But it was love ♪ ♪ It was real ♪

[Jack joins them, and notices the book Stacy is studying from]

JACK: What's the sat?

STACY: The...SAT's?

MAX: You were homeschooled, huh?

JACK: Uh...yes.

ELIOT: Whoa. Do demons really look like this?

[Eliot holds up the page he's looking at for Jack to see the drawing of a demon inside]

JACK: Uh... No. They don't have horns. They actually look like smoke, unless they've possessed a human. Then, they can look like me or you... or anybody.

STACY: Really?

ELIOT: And you've seen one before?

JACK: I've killed one.

MAX: Yeah? [she chuckles, skeptical] How?

[they move outside to the back yard]

JACK: This is an angel blade.

MAX: So...it's made out of angels?

JACK: Uh, no, it kills angels and demons.

ELIOT: Cool.

STACY: Hey! Unh-unh! You're not going to go swinging some giant knife around.

ELIOT: I was just gonna --

STACY: Remember that time you almost killed yourself with a Slinky?

ELIOT: I didn't.

STACY: He tried to eat it.

ELIOT: I was 3.

MAX: So, how do you use it?

JACK: Well, there are standard hand-to-hand combat moves. Like a lightsaber. Or you can throw it, like... this.

[Jack throws the blade at a tree and it bounces off and lands in the weeds]

MAX: Nice.


[night, in the woods, Sam and Dean defy the sheriff's order to stay out of the woods, and hunt for the Kohonta]

DEAN: That sheriff was definitely hiding something.

SAM: Yeah, either that or he's scared. Oh, by the way, uh, "Kohonta" means "whistler."

DEAN: All right. How do we kill it?

SAM: Well, here's the thing. The lore doesn't really specify.

DEAN: Great. Well, my vote? Shotgun, head, done.

[they hear rustling nearby and stop walking, there's distant whistling among other creepy sounds, including a coyote]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Drop your weapons!

[Sam and Dean do as they're told, at gunpoint]

SHERIFF ROMERO: You boys don't listen, do you? Told you. Stay out of these woods! I don't care if you're FBI.

SAM: All right. Sheriff. We're not FBI.

DEAN: Does the word "Kohonta" mean anything to you?

SHERIFF ROMERO: No.

DEAN: You're lyin'.

SHERIFF ROMERO: I'm not. You're coming in with me. Move. Now!

[the sheriff tries to force them to comply, rifle barrel to Dean's back, but Dean ducks, spins, and disarms him while Sam picks up his gun again, holding the sheriff at gunpoint now]

DEAN: Sorry, Sheriff.


[night, in the yard, Stacy, Max, and Eliot are still watching Jack throw the angel blade at the tree, and he still hasn't succeeded]

MAX: Getting closer.

JACK: I-I'm just a little rusty.

MAX: Mm-hmm.

ELIOT: It's cool if you can't do it, dude.

JACK: I can do it, okay?

JACK: Just... watch.

[Jack uses his powers to summon the angel blade to his hand]

ELIOT: What...

STACY: The...

MAX: Hell?

[Jack uses his power to throw the blade, embedding it in the tree]

Dude! Are you like... a Jedi or something?

JACK: Kinda.

JACK: Watch this.

[Jack pulls the blade from the tree with his power, leaving it to float in front of him, then sends it flying around the yard]

MAX: Holy...

ELIOT: This is so cool.

[Eliot and Max watch mesmerized, but Stacy is clearly afraid, walks over to Max and stands behind her]

STACY: Max?

Max (noticing Stacy's discomfort): Uh... Okay, Jack. Cut it out.

JACK: Don't worry. You're safe. Look.

[Jack sends the blade flying around near the three teens, and they all seem distressed now, but Jack continues anyway]

ELIOT: Whoa. Jack.

JACK: I can control it.

MAX: I don't care! Just stop!

ELIOT: Jack?

JACK: What?

MAX: Seriously, Jack! Stop!

[Jack is entirely focused on the floating blade, but Stacy has had enough and takes a few steps toward Jack in hopes of stopping him, but Jack doesn't notice and the blade stabs through her stomach]

MAX: Stacy!

JACK: No, no, no, no, no, no.

[Stacy collapses, and Max and Eliot run to her side

MAX: Stacy!

ELIOT: Oh, God! Oh, God!

MAX: (to Stacy) It's okay, it's okay. (to Eliot) E-Eliot, go call 911. (to Stacy again) It's okay. You stay with me, okay? Please.

JACK: I was in control. E-Everything was fine. She moved.

MAX: Get away from her!

911 Operator over Eliot's phone: 911. What's your emergency?

MAX: Stacy. It's okay. I'm here. Okay? Okay? Stacy. Please.

JACK: I can fix this.

[Jack kneels beside Stacy, pulls out the angel blade]

MAX: What are you doing?!

JACK: Trust me. Okay.

[Jack uses his power to heal Stacy's wound]

911 Operator: Sir? Sir? Hello? Are you still there?

ELIOT: Stace?

[she lifts her shirt and shows she's been healed]

STACY: How?

JACK: I-I fixed you.

[Max hugs Stacy, and Jack bends as if he's going to hug her too, but Eliot stops him]

ELIOT: Don't.

JACK: But she's okay. Everything's fine. Right?

MAX: No! Okay? Just...get away.

[Max takes Stacy into the house, leaving Eliot glaring at Jack]

JACK: Eliot?

ELIOT: I don't know... what you are. But stay away.


ACT 3
[night, in the woods, Sam and Dean hold the Sheriff at gunpoint]

DEAN: We hunt things. Fight things and kill things people don't understand. So... Kohonta. Talk.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Uh... I-I... I didn't think it was real. The Kohonta was a tribal legend, an old story. I haven't heard about it since I was a kid. But then I s-saw it the night Barbara was killed.

SAM: Wait a second. So that's why you've been trying to keep people out of the woods?

DEAN: So what the hell is this thing?

SHERIFF ROMERO: It's not what. Who. The Parker family, they were some of the first white settlers around here. They set a homestead up in these woods -- the cabin.

SAM: And then?

SHERIFF ROMERO: Things went bad. There was a hard winter. Their oldest son, Henry, survived... but he did things.

DEAN: What kind of things? Like Donner Party?

SHERIFF ROMERO: Pretty much. They say that boy not only ate his family, they said he went... mad with hunger. He went after my people, and then when my tribe caught him, they... Killing him would have been too easy. They wanted that boy to suffer. For his crimes against our people, crimes against nature. They cursed him. He's doomed to roam the woods... always starving. And if he didn't feed... his body would eat itself. The Kohonta aren't born. They're made.

[flashbacks of Henry Parker going mad, being trapped and cursed, being turned into the Kohonta]

DEAN: So they just let some flesh-eating freak loose?

SHERIFF ROMERO: They bound him to this forest. They marked the trees to keep folks away. But that was a long time ago.

SAM: Yeah, people forget.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Even me.

DEAN: Well, it's a good thing. Like I said, we hunt these things.

SHERIFF ROMERO: What do you mean?

SAM: Kohonta, werewolves, demons.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Those are real?

DEAN: Oh, yeah. Yeah. And we kill 'em.

SHERIFF ROMERO: You -- Just the two of you?

SAM: We know what we're doing.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Do you? Look, if those monsters are out there, why don't you tell people? Give them -- well, us -- a chance to fight back?

DEAN: Because telling people about this stuff -- they don't always believe. Your people tried to warn you about this whistling freak. Nobody bought it. Not even you.

SHERIFF ROMERO: So? Just record them, put it on YouTube.

DEAN: Knowing about monsters and fighting 'em are two different things.

SHERIFF ROMERO: So you make that choice for everybody? Imagine telling them. Imagine the lives you could save.

SAM: No. No. It doesn't work like that. People die. Even when they know how to fight, people still die.

[the sheriff's phone rings and he pulls it out of his pocket and answers. It's his son, sitting in a car near the woods]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Tom.

TOM: I can't do this anymore.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Where are you?

TOM: Just listen. Whatever's out there... I just want you to know I'm going to find it... and kill it.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Tom! No! To--

[Tom disconnects the call and heads into the woods to the ominous whistling]

SHERIFF ROMERO: He's alone out there. We gotta find him.

DEAN: Okay, slow down.

SHERIFF ROMERO: Look, I-I lied to him. I told him it was a coyote.

DEAN: Listen. We're gonna help you protect your son, okay?

Sam: We're not entirely sure how to kill this thing.

SHERIFF ROMERO: I am. Look. The story says a silver blade through the heart.

Sam (pulling a silver blade from his pocket): Silver blade. Can do.

[they set off in search of Tom, who's laying down meat as bait when he hears the whistling again. Tom eventually finds a cabin, presumably the Parker house. As Tom approaches the building, the shadows in the woods behind him shift where the Kohonta lies in wait for him.]


ACT 4
[night, at the Parker cabin, Tom slowly climbs the stairs and peeks in the window. He hears something move in the woods and it growls as he shines his flashlight around. Meanwhile, the sheriff, Sam, and Dean, race through the woods trying to find him in time.]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Thomas! Thomas!

[Tom, at the door of the cabin, is tackled through the door by the Kohonta, knocking him unconscious. The monster crawls over him and opens its mouth to feed when the Sheriff arrives, drawing the monster's attention]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Hey!

[the Kohonta attacks the sheriff, but the sheriff pins the monter to the wall, holding him in place with a stick.]

SHERIFF ROMERO: Aaah!

[Dean comes running in while the sheriff continues to fight the monster, and picks up Tom and carries him outside to safety. Sam comes in through the back door as the Kohonta bites the sheriff's shoulder, and fires several rounds into the monster's back. The monster leaves the sheriff to attack Sam, who shoots it again and then fights it. Sam drops his silver knife during the fight, but the Sheriff picks it up and hands it to Dean, who tells him to go outside with his son]

DEAN: Go! Go! (to the Kohonta, as he shines his flashlight on it and it squirms) Whoa. You don't like that, huh? Come on!

[Dean goads the Kohonta to attack him, and slowly it approaches him, snarling, as Dean lures it out into the open, away from Sam]

DEAN: Yeah. Come on, come on.

DEAN: Aaah!

[Dean stabs the monster with the silver blade, and then backs away to stand by Sheriff Romero as they watch it roar and melt into a puddle of green goo]

DEAN: Whoa. That was like full-on "Raiders."

SHERIFF ROMERO: Tom. He's alive.


ACT 5
[in the woods, Tom is strapped to a gurney and wheeled to an ambulance while Sam and Dean wait in the background]

Paramedic: Easy.

TOM: D-Dad?

SHERIFF ROMERO: Thomas.

TOM: Did we get it? The coyote?

[The Sheriff gives a grim nod and pats Tom's leg as he's being put in the ambulance, but doesn't give him an answer]

Paramedic: Okay...ready?

TOM: Yeah.

[The sheriff walks over to Sam and Dean, waiting by the Impala, and winces at his injured shoulder]

DEAN: You want an ambulance for you?

SHERIFF ROMERO: I didn't know what to tell him.

SAM: How about the truth? He's your son. He deserves the truth.

[Sam and Dean get in the car as the ambulance drives away, siren blaring. Later as they're driving home, they talk]

DEAN: So, telling the kid -- you think that's the best idea?

SAM: What? You don't?

DEAN: It doesn't make his life any better, you know? Do what we always do. When in doubt, lie.

SAM: Yeah, right. Like we did with Jack?

DEAN: I took care of it, okay? We took care of it.

SAM: No, no, Dean. We did not take care of it. You did. And do you think you really took care of it the right way?

DEAN: Jack said he was fine.

SAM: Yeah. He's a kid. And when we were kids, how many times did we tell Dad that we were fine just to make him happy?


[back at the bunker, Jack's in the library doing research]

DEAN: Hey, kid. We're back. You still at it?

JACK: Almost there. How was the Hunt?

DEAN: Oh. Uh...disgusting.

JACK: Oh. Well, I got the supplies. Except for the beer. I didn't have ID.

DEAN: You have tons of IDs.

JACK: They're fake.

SAM: Jack... listen. Dean and I, we -- we want to talk to you about your powers.

JACK: W-What about them?

DEAN: This Hunt, we, uh... we didn't want you coming along because we didn't want you using them.

SAM: Not yet. Not for now. You know, you just got 'em back, Jack. We want to make sure you're comfortable with them again before you...

DEAN: Before you go all X-Men. It was crappy of us not to tell you. You know, we were trying to be nice. 'Cause we care about you. But because we care about you, you deserve the truth.

SAM: You understand that? Jack?

JACK: I understand. I won't use my powers without permission. Promise.

DEAN: Great. And I guess I'll go get some beer.

SAM: What about everything else? You good? I mean, anything happen while we were gone?

JACK: No. Nothin'.

SAM: Good.
