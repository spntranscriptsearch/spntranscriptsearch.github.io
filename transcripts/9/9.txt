TEASER
A white bus drives in the distance of a foggy day in CARIBOU, WYOMING. In close-up, the bus has multiple Christian logos and writings on it: “MELODY MINISTRY GLEE CLUB” “Let us sing to the Lord!” “Honk if you (heart) Jesus” “Jesus saves!”

A women’s chorus is singing a popular Protestant hymn.
♪ This little light of mine ♪
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪
♪ this little light of mine ♪
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪
♪ this little light of mine ♪
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪
♪ let it shine, let it shine, let it shine ♪

The bus pulls up to a roadhouse with a lot of motorcycles parked in front. The door opens, and a bunch of tough-looking male bikers (leather, chains, tattoos, piercings, shaved heads) look in disbelief at what walks in. In the bar, "Bad Luck" by Social Distortion is playing:

♪ you got a nasty disposition ♪
♪ no one really knows the reason why ♪
♪ you got a bad, bad reputation ♪
♪ gonna hang your head down and cry ♪
♪ you got bad, bad luck ♪
♪ bad, bad luck ♪
♪ you got bad, bad luck ♪

The bikers line up against one wall, and about a dozen women in matching white dresses and orange cardigans line up along the other wall.

BIKER You shouldn't be here.

BLONDE GLEE CLUBBER We have just as much right to be here as you do, brother.

Angel-blades snic into hands. The scene from outside the bar shows brilliant white light flashing, while screams and yells are heard and the window glass is shattered. The door is opened and the sisters walk out of the roadhouse, back to their bus; their outfits are spattered with blood.

♪ 13 is my lucky number ♪
♪ to you, it means stay inside ♪
♪ No one really knows the reason why ♪
♪ your enemies are gettin' nearer ♪
♪ gonna hang down your head and cry ♪
♪ you got bad, bad luck ♪
♪ bad, bad luck ♪

Inside the roadhouse bikers’ bodies are everywhere. Social Distortion plays in the background.
Outside by the bus:

BLONDE GLEE CLUBBER
All right, girls, everybody.

The women’s voices sing as the bus drives off.
♪ This little light of mine ♪
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪


SUPERNATURAL
ACT ONE
Supernatural 9x09 “Holy Terror”


SCENE
NIGHTTIME. DEAN is driving; SAM is in the passenger seat.

DEAN
So, he's better?

EZEKIEL-IN-SAM
Yes. Sam is much improved. It shouldn't be much longer now.

DEAN
Okay, you know you said the same thing to me last week, right?

EZEKIEL-IN-SAM
As I told you when we met – this will take time.

DEAN (impatiently, frustrated)
(exhales in frustration)
Okay, well, go then. Heal. I'd like my brother back, please.

EZEKIEL-IN-SAM (stiffly)
I must say, Dean, I'm very uncomfortable with this whole trip. Investigating crimes involving angels – or anything involving angels – puts me, and therefore, Sam, at risk.

DEAN
Well, family business, Zeke. Okay? If we ignore this, Sam's gonna think that something fishy's going on.

EZEKIEL-IN-SAM
(pause) Then I trust you will be discreet.

DEAN
(pause) Wait, if you know where we're going, that means you've been listening in. Are you – are you hearing everything between me and Sam?

EZEKIEL-IN-SAM
No. Just a word here and there. I have better things to do with my time than eavesdrop, like heal your brother. (pointedly)

DEAN
Okay, 'cause here's the thing—

SAM’s eyes flash blue as EZEKIEL recedes and SAM resumes.

SAM (picking up, midway through a sentence)
— you know, I was gonna say, it seems like it's getting really quiet out there, you know? Not a peep from the angels, even Buddy Boyle goes off the air and stops recruiting for them.

DEAN (adjusting to a sudden change in conversational partners)
Obviously calm before the storm.

SAM (unconvinced)
Yeah, maybe.

SAM notices something outside and stares in startlement.

DEAN
What?

SAM
That sign said "Fort Collins, 50 miles."

DEAN
So?

SAM
So, last time I looked, like, 12 seconds ago, uh, Fort Collins was a hundred miles.

DEAN (searching for something to say)
Well, hey, man, ever since that goddess got her hooks into you, you know—

SAM (getting agitated)
No, it's more than Vesta! I mean, this kind of thing's been happening to me. Like, like, there are chunks of time just … missing. Like there are times when I'm... not here.

DEAN
Well, like I've said—

SAM
Yes, the trials. I know. I heard you. I heard you when you said it the last week and the week before that and the week before that.

DEAN
Yeah, because ... damn straight the trials. They whacked you, man. You're not up to warp speed yet, okay? But you will be.
(Smiles at SAM.)
Would I lie?

SAM looks back at DEAN, in the dark.



SCENE
DAYLIGHT, at the ROADHOUSE.

Crime-scene investigation is on.

SAM and DEAN pull up in the IMPALA, get out in suits, and flash their FBI “badges” at a uniformed cop.

COP
Ah, one of your guys is here already.

SAM and DEAN look at each other, put their ID back in their pockets, and head into the roadhouse.



SCENE
INSIDE THE ROADHOUSE

SAM clears his throat. SAM and DEAN look around, spot CASTIEL, and head his way.

CASTIEL (to a cop, excusing himself)
Ah, my colleagues.

DEAN looks pointedly at CASTIEL. SAM smiles in unabashed and barely concealed pleasure, and slaps CASTIEL on the arm.

SAM (in faux FBI-colleague voice, smiling)
“Agent.”

CASTIEL (pleased to be in on the game with the lads)
Agent.

DEAN (cutting in, no fun at all)
Cas. What the hell are you doing?

CASTIEL
Um, (sotto voce) I still have that badge you gave me.

DEAN Yeah. Uh, what the hell are you doing?

CASTIEL
The murders were all over the news. I, I thought I might be of help.

SAM
Yeah, but Cas, you know that this is an angel situation, right? I mean, you left that night because angels were on your ass.

DEAN (uncomfortable, interjects)
Yeah, and you were living the life, you know? Early retirement, working your way up the Gas-n-Sip ladder.

CASTIEL
If angels are slaughtering one another, I have to do what I can to help. It is a risk we should be willing to take, don't you think? (SAM shrugs in agreement, seeing the point.) Hey. Cas is back in town.

DEAN
Seriously, did you – (to SAM) did he just say that?

CASTIEL (showing photos)
These angels, uh, they were butchered. Much more violence than was required.

SAM
Definitely took more than one or two killers to pull this off.

DEAN
Hit squad? Bartholomew's people?

SAM
Well, Bartholomew has a faction we know about, but this could be somebody else entirely we don't know.

CASTIEL (patting both boys on their shoulders)
Well, whoever it is... We'll find them.

DEAN
"We'll" find them. That's great.

SAM or EZEKIEL-IN-SAM looks disapproving. DEAN sees his disapproving look, and slinks off.



SCENE
NIGHTTIME. Two cars pull up in a deserted industrial location for a rendezvous. The drivers get out and open the doors for each car.

Out of one car, steps the blonde GLEE CLUBBER, and a weedy-haired man in a leather jacket and goatee. The weedy-haired man, MALACHI, is flanked by BLONDE GLEE CLUBBER ANGEL and a very tall, butch, male angel.

Out of the other car steps BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT, a woman, flanked by two more men; all are in corporate-style suits.

BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT
Good evening, Malachi.

MALACHI
Where is he?

BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT
Bartholomew is quite busy tonight. With such a large following, well, the responsibilities are enormous.

MALACHI
I called for a top-level summit. I don't deal with hand maidens.

BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT
(smiles) I'll convey your thoughts to Bartholomew.

MALACHI
He'll regret the disrespect.

BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT
YOU speak of disrespect, Malachi? After the bloodbath two nights ago?

MALACHI
Bartholomew's naked grab for power was nothing but disrespect! (voice raises angrily) He and I ultimately want the same thing. The only way we can take Heaven back from Metatron is to unite. And if Bartholomew wants to avoid all-out warfare on Earth, he'll meet personally with me to negotiate terms.

BARTHOLOMEW’S ASSISTANT
I'm sorry. I should've mentioned earlier, Bartholomew said to tell you he doesn't negotiate with street thugs. (pause; smiles snottily) Are we done here?

MALACHI
Yes, we are.

MALACHI’s hench-angels throw angel-knives at BARTHOLOMEW’s two people; they die, white light streaming out of their corpses. BA screams as MALACHI rushes at her and stabs her himself.

Her body drops to the ground. MALACHI wipes his blade.

MALACHI
And so it begins.

MALACHI drops the blood-stained kerchief on BA’s corpse.



SCENE
Interior of a bar. SAM, CASTIEL, and DEAN, are at a bar table, having a beer.


CASTIEL
It is so good being together again. You know, this is my first beer as a human. I hope it's okay, me joining you?

SAM
Why wouldn't it be okay?

DEAN (looks alarmed at this turn of the conversation)
You know, Cas, are you sure you're ready to jump back into all this? I mean, it seemed to me like you'd actually found some peace.

CASTIEL
Hey, you once told me that you don't choose what you do. It chooses you.

DEAN
Huh?

CASTIEL
I'm a part of this. (clinks beer bottles with DEAN) Like it or not.

SAM
All right, well, then, in that case, we have to figure out, uh, who are we up against, what do they want, and how do we stop them.

CASTIEL
Well, Bartholomew wants to reverse Metatron's spell. Presumably to – to retake Heaven once his following is large enough. That's according to April.

DEAN
The reaper you banged.

CASTIEL
Yeah, and you stabbed.

DEAN
Yeah.
(awkward pause)
She was hot.

CASTIEL
So hot. And very nice.

DEAN (appreciatively)
Mm.

CASTIEL
Up to the point she started torturing me.

DEAN
Yeah. Well, not every hookup's perfect. (DEAN pats CASTIEL’s arm companionably.)

SAM (smiling at the exchange)
All right. I'm gonna get us another round.

CASTIEL
Nah. I'll get it.
CASTIEL hops off his bar stool, then returns.
Mm. (swigging the last of his old beer, and setting the bottle on the table.)
You know, I've never done this before.

DEAN
(sighs)
One beer, he's hammered.

Blue light flashes in SAM’s eyes; EZEKIEL-IN-SAM is back.

DEAN (knowing he's about to get more grief from EZEKIEL-IN-SAM)
Oh, boy.

EZEKIEL-in-SAM
Well? What are you going to do about this?

DEAN
About Cas?

EZEKIAL-in-SAM
He is a beacon, Dean, pulling every angel for miles down on our heads.

DEAN
All right, you know what, Zeke? Level with me. What is it that you're so afraid of?

EZEKIEL-IN-SAM
I told you. When I chose to answer your prayers and heal Sam, I chose sides. That means I'm not in good standing with certain angels.

DEAN
Okay, well, you know what? Cas isn't in good standing with any angel, all right? But here he is, ass on the line, fighting the fight. So tell me, what makes you so special?

CASTIEL (returning)
Here we go. Three brewskies.

EZEKIEL-IN-SAM (pissily)
I'm going to get something out of the car.



SCENE
Outside. EZEKIEL-IN-SAM is walking. He hears something and slows ...

METATRON
Well, I'm really looking forward to this.

EZEKIEL-IN-SAM
Excuse me?

METATRON
Oh, please. I know who you really are. And it isn't Ezekiel.

NOT-EZEKIEL-IN-SAM looks constipated.

ACT TWO
DEAN and CASTIEL at the bar.


CASTIEL
(clears throat) I, um, I noticed you look... kind of uncomfortable whenever Sam mentions my leaving. Doesn't he know that you told me to leave?

DEAN
Here's the deal. When Sam was doing the trials to seal up Hell, it messed him up. Okay? The third one nearly killed him. If I'd let him finish, it would have. He's still messed up, bad.

CASTIEL
You said the angel, Ezekiel, helped heal him.

DEAN (looks down, avoiding the question)
Look, I got to do anything I can to get him back. Now, if that means that we keep our distance from you for a little while, then... Then I don't have a choice. I don't feel good about it, but I don't have a choice. It's great to have your help, Cas. Okay, but we just can't work together.

CAS looks sad.




SCENE
Outside the bar.

METATRON
Relax. I'm not here to out you. But I am curious, why Ezekiel?

NOT-EZEKIEL-IN-SAM
They say he is a good, and ... honorable angel.

METATRON
Ahhhh. Everything they say you are not. I see your point... Gadreel.

NOT-EZEKIEL-IN-SAM (henceforth to be known as GADREEL-IN-SAM)
The stories about me – they are not true!

METATRON
And yet you spent countless thousands of years locked in Heaven's darkest dungeon. And now you're hiding in this human, posing as Ezekiel. (shakes his head) Tragic.
It broke His heart to lock you away, you know? You were God's most trusted. That's why He chose you to protect the garden. Your one task was to keep evil from entering... from befouling His cherished creation, mankind, and you failed Him!

GADREEL-IN-SAM
Not my doing.

METATRON
Well, for whatever reason, the serpent entered. The Earth is cursed with evil. Someone had to be blamed.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
What is it you want of me, Metatron?

METATRON
(sighs) Just to be your friend. You and I go back a long way. I was actually the one who freed you.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
You?

METATRON
I was the one who caused all the angels to fall. Including the imprisoned ones. You're welcome.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
No angels are in Heaven? None at all?

METATRON
No, and you know, at first, I thought I would love it. But it's a big place. My solitude is getting tedious.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
And so?

METATRON
And so ... Plan "B." Rebuild Heaven as the place God envisioned it, only with a handpicked few. No more anemic functionaries like Bartholomew. And no more stupid angels. (consideringly) Maybe some funny ones. You were His most trusted, Gadreel. You want to take back your reputation? You want to reclaim the Heaven that was? We could do this together.

GADREEL-IN-SAM looks tortured.



SCENE
BUNKER. SAM is sitting on a table with a light table map, at his laptop. DEAN comes jogging in.

SAM
Any word from Cas?

DEAN
Nothing yet.

SAM
And we're not ... worried about him, that he just took off like that again? I mean, it's not like he does this kind of stuff alone.

DEAN
It's the way he wanted it, honestly. (looking at SAM, who looks unconvinced) Hey, look, man, he's been all over the map since he got his wings clipped. (changing the subject) What do you got? (rolls his chair over to SAM to look at his laptop) Obituaries. That one of the bikers?

SAM
Yeah. His name was Red Dawg.

DEAN
Heh. Of course it was.

SAM
It's not what you think. Look, he's a family guy. Big in the PTA, he played Santa at Christmas parties.

DEAN
So, what? Just one day, he up and joined a biker gang?

SAM
No, he did that years ago. Get this. This is weird. Look. (pulling up news clippings and photos) These are all the victims, right? They were all baptized together.

DEAN
Baptized?

SAM
Yeah. They were a born-again biker gang.

DEAN
Well, that is not something you hear every day.

SAM
No, it's not.

DEAN (sees something on the screen)
Wait, make that bigger. (SAM obligingly does so, and they look at a biker logo on a jacket.) "Boyle's Boys"? Boyle, as in reverend Buddy Boyle?

SAM learns forward and does some fancy fingerwork on the keyboard for a second.

SAM
Listen to this. Red Dawg's widow said he was always religious, but a week before he died, he came home from a prayer meeting and was a changed man filled with divine glory.

DEAN
So, Boyle's at it again. Selling folks on being meat suits for angels.

SAM
Just what – talking to smaller groups now?

DEAN
I don't know. Maybe, uh, softening up thousands at a time, he wasn't able to control what angels got let in. This way, Bartholomew's followers can jump in just as soon as Boyle does his thing.

SAM
So, Red Dawg and his guys were Bartholomew people?

DEAN
Yeah, and they got slaughtered. Which means that this new group is even worse. (pause) Haven't I always said that angels are dicks?



SCENE
NIGHT TIME, campfire with a bunch of adults sitting around a circle holding books (presumably Bibles). BLONDE GLEE CLUBBER ANGEL is giving an inspirational speech.
BLONDE GLEE CLUBBER ANGEL
And I so appreciate the opportunity to address your Bible-study group.
I admire your passion, your energy, your devotion.
You are exactly what God and His angels have in mind for the crusade.
Now, rise.
(A bunch of white lights are streaming and swirling around above the campfire.)

BLONDE GLEE CLUBBER ANGEL (continuing)
Join hands, all of you.
Feel the Heavenly host reach out to embrace you.
Embrace them back!
The angels want nothing more than to feel your love.

(The white lights start heading toward their waiting vessels down below as the campers look up with open-mouthed delight and wonder.)

BLONDE GLEE CLUBBER ANGEL (continuing)
Welcome them into your hearts.
Let them in!
In the name of Malachi, let them in!

As she is reaching a sort of ecstatic climax of excitement, she is suddenly stabbed by someone coming from behind – her angelic white light floods from a stab wound in her chest.

Lots of screams. (No! No! Aaaggghh! Etc.)

Angels are running around, placing their hands on the humans’ foreheads; the humans fall down, their eyes burnt out as last seen in season four. BLONDE GLEE CLUBBER ANGEL lies dead, a red stain on her chest.

Crickets chirping.

ACT THREE
METATRON
Frankly, I never got used to them. I lived among them for centuries. I had to isolate myself to keep sane.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
Humans do seem chaotic, Metatron.

METATRON
Which makes them fascinating, but... All that emotion. Geez. And the wasted energy. It's just... exhausting.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
I know. Sam Winchester... It is a mess in here. And the brother – I do not know where to start.

METATRON
I can free you from them. From all of them.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
You intend to be the ruler of this new Heaven, am I correct?

METATRON
Uh... It is a burden I feel I must accept.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
Then Metatron, does that not make you God?

METATRON
Oh-ho-ho. Semantics. I don't know that I'd take on THAT name...necessarily. No. When the time comes, we'll call me... "X."

GADREEL-IN-SAM
"X"?

METATRON
You and I ... We could have paradise again, Gadreel.



SCENE
Interior hotel room; daylight outside. CASTIEL is kneeling.

CASTIEL
(exhales)

Okay.

(CASTIEL, kneels beside the bed, closes his eyes, and folds his hands in prayer.) I'm... unfamiliar with this end of the process. Of course, no one may be listening, um, but I – I do need assistance.

(CASTIEL sits on the bed in lotus position, legs folded, arms extended, thumb and forefinger touching.)

I have questions, and there seem to be no answers.

(kneeling prostrate on the floor) I... I wouldn't presume to ask for help if I weren't desperate, but I need help.

(standing upright, eyes closed, arms extended, palms upward) I'm lost.

(lying on the bed, legs bent, feet down, hands over his eyes)

I need your guidance.

(kneeling, hands folded, eyes closed) Please hear my prayer.

(Pause.)

I don't know how humans do it.

Giving up for now, CASTIEL walks over to the TV, and tries to turn it on. It seems unresponsive.

WOMAN'S VOICE (muffled, from outside the room)
Try plugging it in.

CASTIEL looks to the door, and opens it up.

WOMAN (in park ranger uniform)
Surely that wasn't the answer you were seeking.

CASTIEL
You're an angel!

MURIEL
Muriel (she introduces herself). I didn't pick the outfit. (She stares in sudden recognition) Castiel? (and turns away to leave)

CASTIEL
No, wait – please, just hear me out!

MURIEL
It can't be known that I even spoke to you.

CASTIEL
I just need a moment.

MURIEL
No.

CASTIEL
Please. I just need information.



SCENE
BUNKER. KEVIN and DEAN are researching at tables. DEAN is at a laptop; KEVIN is looking at a tablet.

KEVIN
Dean, there may be nothing in here. Crowley said the spell that cast down the angels was irreversible.

DEAN
Yeah, well, screw Crowley. Why would you think that anything he says is true?

KEVIN
This part is nearly indecipherable. Almost like, when Metatron wrote it down, he wanted to keep the words hidden, even from Prophets.

SAM (enters)
Hey.

DEAN
Hey. Check this out. Another angel attack.

SAM
What? Where?

DEAN
Utah. A, uh, college, uh, Bible-study group and their, uh, their guest speaker – some top-shelf church lady. Insides scorched out, kids' eyes were missing, but, not the church lady's.

SAM
So, she was an angel, too?

DEAN
Sounds like. Uh, and she sang soprano for the, uh, Melody Ministry Glee Club?

SAM
Okay?

DEAN
The club goes to its gigs on a bus, so when I checked with the Wyoming cops, they said that a witness saw the same bus leaving the biker bar not long before the bodies were found.

SAM
So, church-lady angel was at both killings?

DEAN
I'm guessing that she and whoever she's running with killed Bartholomew's bikers at the bar and then Bart's boys hit her back.

SAM
When she was recruiting those students to be vessels. (sighs) Wow. It's a bunch of kids.

DEAN
Kevin. Clock's ticking.



SCENE
Hotel room.

MURIEL
Let's say you're telling the truth and Metatron tricked you. I should still turn you in.

CASTIEL
But you won't.

MURIEL
Don't be so sure.

CASTIEL
I... I think you instinctively trust me. We're similar. We both want no part of the fanatics.

MURIEL
And when you prayed. How did you know you wouldn't get one of them?

CASTIEL
I'm warded, and my Grace is gone, and I was hoping that I would seem like just another desperate human that the... the militants couldn't care less about.

MURIEL
And you think I care?

CASTIEL
You're here. You may know the situation. Bartholomew, he's in a blood feud with another faction.

MURIEL
It's madness.

CASTIEL
Who leads the opposition?

MURIEL
Malachi.

CASTIEL
Malachi? The anarchist.

MURIEL
He's become equals with Bartholomew. In some ways, worse.

CASTIEL
But there's still those like you who want to stay out of it.

MURIEL
Fewer and fewer. Each side is rounding up those who try and stay neutral. Angels are being tortured and killed if they don't pledge loyalty.

CASTIEL
(sighs) It's worse than I thought.

MURIEL
Each side wants to crush the other, overthrow Metatron, and rule Heaven, and... Heaven under either of them would be...

CASTIEL
Hell.

Suddenly the door is kicked in, and MALACHI's thug (THEO) and another shorter person behind him burst in. CASTIEL and MURIEL stare in horror.



SCENE
A long hallway, dark with sporadic lamps. Lashing sounds and screams in the distance.

MALACHI
This is a bonus, Castiel. We were tracking Muriel, cowardly holdout that she is, (MURIEL is shown: She is bound, and bloody and bruised about the face.) and wonder of wonders, she led us to you. (CASTIEL is also bloody and beaten.)

MURIEL
Not knowingly.

MALACHI
I stand corrected. Not knowingly. Stupidly.

CASTIEL
I've explained in detail. I don't know how Metatron's spell worked. Therefore, I can't assist in reversing it. I was an unwitting accomplice.

MALACHI
Ohhh. A dupe. The great Castiel. Valued and trusted Castiel. (MALACHI walks over to a tray of metal devices, medical or dental, with clear torture value.) Top-of-the-Christmas-tree Castiel. No more than a dupe. (pause)
Dupe or mastermind, you were inside the circle. You know where Metatron's weakness lies.

CASTIEL
No. I don't.

MALACHI
(sighs) Theo.

THEO (the tall scarred thug) advances.

CASTIEL
No! (THEO pulls his head back, and slides a silver angel knife down CASTIEL's chest) Ahhh, ahhh! (he groans in pain).

MALACHI
You'd suffer, even die for your beliefs. I get it.
But is Metatron, (turning to THEO) whose poll numbers have totally tanked (THEO laughs), ...worth your life? More importantly, is Metatron worth her life?

CASTIEL
No. No, she's innocent. You leave her alone.

MALACHI
Hm. I have no intention of touching her.

MALACHI looks at THEO, who nods. MURIEL pants in fear.

MALACHI
Virtue is its own punishment.

CASTIEL
Please, no!

MURIEL
Nooooo!

THEO stabs MURIEL in the chest with a silver angel-knife.

ACT FOUR
MURIEL's body lies on the ground. CASTIEL is in cuffs.

CASTIEL
Angels butchering angels. Is this what we've become?

MALACHI
Just following your example, Castiel.
How many did you kill in Heaven? How many in the Fall? (off CASTIEL's look)
Oh, you didn't know? A host of angels died when they fell – Azrael, Sophia, Ezekiel (At this last name, CASTIEL turns very thoughtful) ...
"Died" doesn't even describe it.
Devastation. Wings shredded, unspeakable agony at your hands.
So, I think you would want to provide any information you have, considering...

(pause; no response from CASTIEL)

All right.
I leave you in the hands of an artist.

(to THEO)
I don't care what's left.

THEO
Don't ask for mercy. There is none.

THEO walks and shuts the door, then returns to CASTIEL, and picks up a drill.

THEO
I'll give you one last chance for this to end.

CASTIEL
Give me a quick death.

CASTIEL closes his eyes and holds up his face in anticipation of the blow(s).

THEO
I need you to speak to Metatron. Everyone knows you have influence.

CASTIEL now opens his eyes and looks in astonishment at THEO.

THEO (continuing)
He'll listen to you. Ask him to raise me to Heaven. You can do this, Castiel. I'll be a soldier for Metatron, do anything he wants.

CASTIEL
You – you serve Malachi.

THEO
I thought he was the answer, but he's crazy.

CASTIEL
You're... noticing this now? You were more than willing to do his dirty work.

THEO
I did what I had to.

CASTIEL
When you were sure he would defeat Bartholomew.

THEO
But no one will survive this war.

CASTIEL
So, you prefer to sit it out in Heaven.

THEO
I can talk to him about restoring your grace.

CASTIEL (calculating)
Well, it's, um, it's true. Metatron and I do have a working relationship.

THEO (smiles)
I knew it!

CASTIEL
You're clever, Theo.

THEO
You're allies.

CASTIEL
And he could use a skilled soldier like yourself. (CASTIEL pretends to reconsider.) Oh, but I don't know.

THEO
I-I'm a team player, Castiel.

CASTIEL
All right. Well? (gestures at his manacles; THEO opens them up)

CASTIEL
I'll – I'll need a moment to make contact. (THEO waits.) And you have something that I'll need.

THEO
Anything.

CASTIEL grabs one of the medical implements and slices THEO in the throat, letting his white grace slip out; CASTIEL opens his mouth and swallows it.

Mm. (CASTIEL groans; the grace fills him up; his eyes turn blue; THEO stares in dazed recrimination, blood dripping from his neck. CASTIEL looks at him, then puts a hand to his forehead; THEO screams, his angelic white light bursts out of him, and he falls to the ground his eyes burned out.



MALACHI, whistling, comes back downstairs. He sees bodies everywhere. Rushes back into the cell and sees THEO's body on the ground.

MALACHI
No.
Oh, no.



SCENE
BUNKER

DEAN is heading into kitchen, as KEVIN is walking out with a sandwich.

DEAN
Hey. You seen Sam?

KEVIN
He went out.

DEAN
Where?

KEVIN
I don't know. You notice he's doing that a lot?

DEAN (thoughtful)
Yeah.

DEAN's phone rings. KEVIN walks out as DEAN is answering.

DEAN (on a payphone)
Yeah.

CASTIEL (on the phone)
Dean, I don't have a lot of time, so listen. The leader of the opposition is an angel named Malachi.

DEAN
How do you know that?

CASTIEL
He had me. I, uh, I was tortured. But I got away.

DEAN
How?

CASTIEL
I... I did what I had to. I became what they've become. A barbarian.

DEAN
What are you – Cas, where are you?

CASTIEL
It's better I stay away. They're gonna want me even more now. But I'm gonna be all right. I... I got my Grace back. Well, not mine per se, but it'll do.

DEAN
Wait, you're – you're back? You got your mojo?

CASTIEL
I'm not sure. But I am an angel.

DEAN
And you're okay with that?

CASTIEL
If we're going to war, I need to be ready.

DEAN
(pause)
Cas.

CASTIEL
Dean. There's more.

DEAN
What?

CASTIEL
Didn't you say Sam was healed by an angel named Ezekiel?

DEAN
Uh... Yeah, why?

CASTIEL
Ezekiel is dead.

DEAN
What?

CASTIEL
He died when the angels fell.

DEAN's face has a very concentrated "oh this is bad" expression.



SCENE
KEVIN is dozing over a book. DEAN approaches.

DEAN (urgently)
I need a spell. ASAP.

KEVIN (waking up, exhaustedly)
Everyone always needs a spell, and it's always ASAP.

DEAN
All right, listen to me. An angel can't be expelled by another human. Okay, only by the host, right? But, what if there was a way to power down the angel, so that it wasn't in charge for a few seconds?

KEVIN
What?

DEAN
For instance, if – if hypothetically, I wanted to speak with the vessel but not have the squatter listen in.

KEVIN
Why?

DEAN
Why? Kevin, we've got tons of possessed humans out there. You with me? And when the angels kill each other off, the humans are taking it in the teeth. So what if I wanted to clue the human in so that he, or she, could spit the angel out? That would be a good thing, right?

KEVIN
Uh ... yeah?

DEAN
Okay. So, hit the tablet. Let's go! (DEAN turns to walk out.)

KEVIN
Now?

DEAN
Yesterday, Cinderella!



SCENE
Outside, daylight, under a large overpass.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
I've been thinking this over, Metatron. I will join you as second in command.

METATRON
(with an expression of great relief and pleasure)
Bravo, Gadreel! This move will erase the mark that has hounded you through the centuries. Heaven will be restored, as will your reputation as one of Its greatest heroes.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
I thank you for this opportunity.

METATRON
There is just one more thing.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
Yes.

METATRON
I need to be sure of your fidelity.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
You have it.

METATRON
No, I mean REALLY sure. We have enemies who pose an imminent threat to our effort. They must be neutralized.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
Slain?

METATRON
In a word.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
That... That is not who I am.

METATRON
(pulls a yellow card out of his pocket) Yeah. (sarcastically)

Here's the first name on your to-do list.

METATRON hands the yellow card to GADREEL-IN-SAM, who reads the name, and sighs.

METATRON
Decide.

ACT FIVE
SCENE
BUNKER

DEAN
All right, so this masterpiece we just painted – it's gonna work, right?

KEVIN
The sigils are supposed to briefly hobble the possessing angel. If the info's correct.

DEAN
Wait, what?

KEVIN
I only had time to get a little from the tablet. The rest came from an old Men of Letters book. As soon as your blood touches the ignition sigil, the spell kicks in.
(pause)
Dean, what's going on?

DEAN
I told you.

KEVIN
You told me theoretically.
Dean, we just painted sigils in the storeroom. What the hell?

DEAN
You're gonna have to trust me, okay, trust that I told you everything that I can for now. Can you do that?

KEVIN
I always trust you.
(DEAN nods.)
And I always end up screwed.

DEAN
Oh, come on. Always? Not always.



SCENE
BUNKER - SAM is shelving beers. DEAN walks in.

DEAN
Hey, where you been?

SAM
Hey. Beer run.

DEAN
Long beer run.
(SAM chuckles.)
Can we talk?

SAM
Yeah. Uh... Sure.

DEAN ushers SAM into the storeroom.

SAM
This sounds serious.

While SAM is walking in, before he turns around, DEAN shuts the door and pulls out a knife to slash his palm. DEAN slaps his hand against the door; a flare of light emits from the sigil, and SAM turns around, startled.

SAM
What's going on? What are you doing?

DEAN
I got to tell you some stuff fast. It's gonna piss you off.

SAM
Okay.

DEAN
Those trials really messed you up.

SAM
Yes, I know that, Dea—

DEAN (hurriedly)
No, you don't. I mean messed you up like almost dead. No more birthdays, dust to dust. Well, that messed me up, so I made a move, okay, a tough move about you without talking it over because you were in a coma.

SAM
Wait, what? When?

DEAN
You were in the hospital, okay, and they said you were gonna die.

SAM
What did you do?

DEAN
(pauses, mouth working speechlessly for a moment)
I let an angel in.

SAM
In what?

DEAN
In you. He said he could heal you and he is.

SAM
He's still in me? Wait. (laughs) That's impossible, Dean. That couldn't happen. I never invited him in.

DEAN
I tricked you into saying yes. It seemed like the only way.

SAM
(sighs) So... Again. You thought I couldn't handle something, so you took over!

DEAN
No, I did what I had to do! You would've never agreed to it, and you would've died.

SAM
Well, maybe I would've liked the choice, at least.

DEAN
We can do this – later. You can – you can kick my ass all you want. Right now, we got bigger problems.

SAM
Bigger?

DEAN
The angel lied to me. Okay? He – he's not who he said he was. He said his name was Ezekiel. Cool guy, according to Cas, but it's not Ezekiel.

SAM
Who is he?

DEAN
I don't know. Apparently, Ezekiel is dead. Whoever this guy is can end you in a heartbeat if he wants to, so you have got to dump him.
(pause)
Are you hearing what I'm saying? I think you're well enough now, but you got to expel him.
Sam? Sam—
(SAM walks past DEAN)
Hey!
SAM turns around and swings a punch at DEAN. DEAN goes down. SAM walks out, furious.



KEVIN looks up as SAM walks towards him.

KEVIN (looks up)
Hey, Sam.

SAM stops, then continues in, slowly, calmly, and with deliberation.

KEVIN
Hey, do you notice anything a little bit off about Dean lately? Between you and me, I'm a little bit worried about him.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
Don't worry about Dean. Dean will be fine.

GADREEL-IN-SAM looks at KEVIN for a moment then reaches out and grabs his head.

DEAN is rounding the corner into the room, as KEVIN screams. DEAN sees a white light flooding out of KEVIN through his eyes.

DEAN
No!
No! No! No! Kevin?!

DEAN runs forward, as KEVIN's body drops to the floor.

GADREEL-IN-SAM extends a hand and holds DEAN off.

DEAN
Sam?

GADREEL-IN-SAM
There is no more Sam.

DEAN
(gasps in pain)

GADREEL-IN-SAM
But, I played him convincingly, I thought.

DEAN
How did you...

GADREEL-IN-SAM
I heard you talk with Kevin Tran tonight.

FLASHBACK FROM GADREEL-IN-SAM’S PERSPECTIVE

KEVIN
... You told me theoretically. Dean, we just painted sigils in the storeroom. What the hell?
DEAN
You're gonna have to trust me, okay, and trust that I told you everything I can for now. Can you do that?
GADREEL-IN-SAM packs a bag while he talks to DEAN.

GADREEL-IN-SAM
Alter a sigil... even the slightest... Alter the spell.
(He holds up his hand to show the dust of markings on his fingers.)
Sorry about Kevin, but ultimately ... it's for the best.
I did what I had to.

GADREEL-IN-SAM places the yellow card on KEVIN's chest. He turns and looks at DEAN, possibly feeling guilty, then walks out.

As he walks towards the stairs, DEAN is released; he gasps, and looks at KEVIN. KEVIN's eyes are burned out. The door to the bunker shuts.

DEAN
Kevin?
Kevin?

A tear slips from DEAN's eye and he bows his head in sorrow.
