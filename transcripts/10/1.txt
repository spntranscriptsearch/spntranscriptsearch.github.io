THE ROAD SO FAR
[Pat Benatar's "Heartbreaker" plays over the recap]


TEASER
[We open on someone's hands suspended above their head with chains. The camera pulls back to reveal what appears to be a woman, bleeding from several wounds]


DAR

I heard the rumors. I said "no, that can't be." A Winchester, one of us? But it's true, isn't it? Whatever soul you had; whatever boy scout code you cuddled up to at night; it's all gone. Leaving what? Look at you!


[The camera pans around to reveal: surprise, it's SAM, holding a bloody knife]


SAM

Where is Crowley?


DAR

Eat me.


[SAM nods and smirks, hesitates, then steps forward and plunges the knife into DAR's stomach]


SAM

One more time! Where is Crowley?!


[SAM twists the blade as DAR moans in pain]


SAM

Where's my brother?


DAR

I don't know!


SAM

Then you're going to call somebody who does!


[SAM cuts DAR's neck and holds a cup to it to catch the blood]


DAR

No one knows! They won't answer!


SAM

Make the call!


DAR

We're under orders!!


SAM

Make the call!!


DAR [crying]

Please!


[SAM drops the cup and grabs DAR's face and screams at her]


SAM

Where's My Brother?!!??!!!


ACT ONE
[Exterior of Men of Letters Bunker. Now inside, we pan over the table with books on "Demonic Possession" and "Rituals of Human Possession" amid stacks of files and papers. SAM is on the phone]


SAM

Right, right; so, no noticeable crop failures, no mass cattle deaths, nothing?


VOICE [on phone]

No, nothing on the radar, nothing on the scope. I'd say that's a good thing.


SAM

No...yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. I hear you, Mike. Thanks. That is a good thing. Alright, well keep me posted if anything does pop up.


MIKE

Alright. Watch yourself, Sam.


SAM

I will. You got it. Thanks.


[SAM hangs up the phone. We notice that his right arm is immobilized in a sling. Cut to SAM slowly washing his face with his one good hand, and staring into the mirror. Cut to a police scanner on a desk, more open books, and SAM researching crop conditions on his laptop. More time passes; SAM opens the door to Dean's bedroom and turns on the light. He picks up a folded note from Dean's pillow, which reads "SAMMY LET ME GO." Cut to SAM now in the kitchen, with breakfast and a cup of coffee, still researching on his laptop. Something catches his eye: a page about a "Missing Ohio Man Found Slain in Wisconsin." He snatches up his phone and dials]

[Interior of a crappy motel room. We look down upon CASTIEL lying in bed, half-wearing a robe. His phone lights up and starts to vibrate on the nightstand next to him.]

CASTIEL

Sam. Hello.


SAM

I think I might have found something.


CASTIEL

Oh good, good. [coughs several times painfully]


SAM

Cas? You there?


CASTIEL

It's okay, I'm...um...I'm okay. Go...go on. [coughs more painfully]


SAM

Alright, get this. A "John Doe" who was murdered in Wisconsin a week ago turns out to be this guy named Drew Nealy who went missing from religious order in Northern Ohio...okay?


CASTIEL

Yeah? [more coughing]


SAM

Now, Drew Nealy had been missing for 3 years. Killed his wife, his kids...just disappeared. I know it's thin, but...if this guy was possessed...


CASTIEL

That would make him the first [another coughing fit]


SAM

The first lead, the first anything we've seen in... [Sam stops himself, hearing CASTIEL's nonstop coughing]


CASTIEL

[coughs] Sorry.


SAM

Actually...you know what...now that I'm looking at this more I think I uh...I think I jumped the gun here, buddy.


CASTIEL

No, Sam, you said it was something.


SAM

Yeah...uh...it's...it's not. I was wrong, sorry.


CASTIEL

I can help.


SAM

Cas...we tried that.


CASTIEL

Sam...you can't blame what that demon did to your shoulder on me; you were out of...


SAM

I'm not, I'm not blaming anything on you. What happened, happened, and...you need to be worrying about yourself. I really shouldn't have bothered you.


CASTIEL

How are you, Sam?


SAM

Good. I'm alright. I'm just...tired, you know. Be better when we get him back...after...after I kick his butt.


CASTIEL

I miss him.


SAM

Yeah.


CASTIEL

Why would he just disappear?


SAM

Who says he had a choice?


CASTIEL

Well then, who wrote the note? If there's any chance...any chance at all that Dean is still...


SAM

Still...even remotely Dean?


[SAM sadly hangs up the phone, as does CASTIEL. The somber music gives way to the sounds of Right Said Fred's "I'm Too Sexy," and we then cut to DEAN, singing karaoke.]


DEAN [singing badly]

I'm too sexy for my love; too sexy for my love; love's going to leave me.


[The crowd is booing DEAN's terrible singing. DEAN, like honey badger, don't care. He smiles at a waitress, ANNE-MARIE. She acknowledges him with a smile as she walks by. We see that CROWLEY is sitting at a table in the bar, talking to two other men]


DEAN [singing even more off-key]

I'm too sexy for my shirt. Too sexy for my shirt, so sexy it hurts. And I'm too sexy for Milan; too sexy for Milan, New York and Japan!


GIRL IN CROWD

Turn it off!!


DEAN [taking a swig from his beer bottle]

Everybody!


[Cut to DEAN in bed, rolling off of ANNE-MARIE, both naked except for the bedsheet and very satisfied]


ANNE-MARIE

Okay. Wow! What time is it? Daryl's going to kill me if I'm late from my break again.


DEAN [reaching over to look at the clock]

Oops. Heh-heh-heh.


ANNE-MARIE [sits up and hurriedly gets dressed]

Damn! I told you to hurry it up! But then you had to go and do that thing with the...thing.


DEAN

Oh, you mean that thing that you were begging me for?


ANNE-MARIE

Begging you to hurry it up, maybe.


DEAN

Well, let's not argue about good sex.


ANNE-MARIE

It was good, wasn't it?


DEAN

Mmm hmm...just uh...don't get too excited, you know. Or too attached...cause I'm just...rollin' through.


ANNE-MARIE

You know, there's about a million other ways you could have said that.


[The door suddenly opens; it's a perturbed-looking CROWLEY]


DEAN

Whoa!


CROWLEY

Whoa? What's going on here?


DEAN

What's it look like?


CROWLEY

In my bed?


DEAN

What? [looks around, shrugs] Oh yeah...heh heh.


CROWLEY

Jerk.


DEAN

Bitch.


ANNE-MARIE

Get a room, you two.


CROWLEY

Had a room...until you two soiled it.


ANNE-MARIE

Love you, Crowley.


CROWLEY

Love you more...sweetheart.


ANNE-MARIE

Anne-Marie...jackass.


CROWLEY

Knew that.


DEAN [stands up after pulling on just his shirt]

Heh.


CROWLEY

Pants?

[DEAN rolls his eyes and obliges.]

[Western showdown music plays as DEAN and CROWLY face off at foosball against two other guys.]

CROWLEY

Best of three. Losers buy the beer.


DEAN

Lots of beer.


CROWLEY

Girl seemed nice. Slightly damaged. I could see the old you falling for that.


DEAN

Yeah, well, not to worry. She means nothing.


CROWLEY

Good, good. 'Cause you and I, we're rolling stones. No distractions.

Lock it down!

Lock it down!


DEAN

Stop talking.


CROWLEY

You're bodging it!

[The other team scores]


DEAN

Aw. If you'd shut up --

keep talking --I can't play the game.


[DEAN is suddenly distracted by a man grabbing ANNEMARIE and hauling her out of the bar. DEAN and CROWLEY follow them outside. The man is getting rough with ANNEMARIE]]


ANNEMARIE

Get off me.


MATT

Why are you doing this to me?!


ANNEMARIE

You need to calm down.


MATT

Where were you?


ANNEMARIE

Stop it!


DEAN [approaching]

Hey, is this him?


MATT

There a problem?


DEAN

Yeah, are you Matt?


[DEAN grabs MATT and throws him on the hood of a car and starts to punch him.]


ANNEMARIE

Dean!


DEAN

You need to get away from here. Don't try and contact her. In fact, don't even think about her. You understand me?!


[DEAN punches the guy til his is barely conscious. He then turns to ANNEMARIE gives her a look and walks back inside with CROWLEY.]


[CASTIEL is still laying in bed when there is a knock on the door]


CASTIEL

Just a moment.


[He opens the door with his robe hanging open to find HANNAH standing there.]


HANNAH

Castiel.


CASTIEL

Hannah. I'm sensing awkwardness.


[she motions with her eyes to his open robe and he quickly pulls it together. Scene changes to CASTIEL getting dressed and HANNAH fills him in with the state of heaven.]


CASTIEL

So...There's no -- no leader? You're governing yourselves?


HANNAH

Mostly. There's lot of meeting on rebuilding and reorganization -- lots of reconciliation.


CASTIEL

And Metatron?


HANNAH

Still in jail. His door has been made permanent. I would've thought we'd see you sooner.


CASTIEL

I would've come sooner but --


HANNAH

I'm glad you didn't. You see, I...I need your help. Heaven needs your help.


CASTIEL

Anything.


HANNAH

Most of the angels who fell during the fall have returned to heaven. A few have not. Some out-and-out refuse. Rogues. Two of them have killed one of our own for only attempting to bring them back home.


CASTIEL

Who were they?


HANNAH

Daniel and Adina. They must be found. They must be brought home, and they must be punished for the sake of all. Will you help me?


CASTIEL

Yes.


[Scene changes to SAM entering a police station with an officer.]


OFFICER

Appreciate you coming down, agent. But I'm afraid you may have just cost Uncle Sam a tank of gas.


SAM

Oh, why's that?


OFFICER

You came up here to investigate Drew Neely's murder, right?


SAM

Right.


OFFICER

Problem is, no one's certain it was a murder at all.


SAM

Okay, then what are we dealing with here? A suicide?


OFFICER [as they stand in front of a computer]


Self-defense, more likely. Uh, the surveillance footage was corrupted. Our techies finally managed to clean up the file. Hold on a sec now...


[Scene flashes to DEAN exiting the bar 'The Black Spur' in the dark...talking to an unseen person.]


DEAN

We can do this however you want. Don't pretend I didn't see you this afternoon Did you get a good look? You see my moves? I hope so, 'cause I sure could use the competition.


[A man steps from the shadows.]


[Back in the police station]


OFFICER

That John Doe right there is the one you want to keep your eye on.


[The surveillance footage starts showing DEAN in a gas station reading a magazine.]


SAM [staring at his brother]

Son of a bitch.


OFFICER

Watch.


[Back to DEAN and the man]


DEAN

Well, all you Abaddon groupies are the same, you know that? You, the douche that jumped me at the gas station, you can't just can't accept that the queen is dead, can you?


MAN

Maybe we just can't accept that a douche like you was the one who killed her.


DEAN

Ah. Yeah, that's got to hurt, doesn't it?


[DEAN removes the First Blade from under his jacket. The man's eyes flash black.]


[Back at the police station]


OFFICER

Okay, now, porn guy's just minding his own business. And there's Drew Neely. See the knife?


SAM

Yeah.


OFFICER

That's intent right there. Now watch this.


[Drew Neely jumps DEAN in the surveillance footage at the same time as the demon jumps DEAN outside the bar. Both are instantly killed by the First Blade and its owner.]


OFFICER

Looks like a cutlass or something. I don't know what the hell this is. Problem is, we don't know if this guy's a hero or a psychopath.


[The OFFICER stops the tape on a closeup of DEAN's face. SAM just stares at his brother's image]


That's the image that's getting uploaded to the wires.


SAM [recovering his voice]


Detective, do you mind if I, uh, take another look at this?


OFFICER

Knock yourself out. I'll be back in a few.


SAM

All right.


[SAM rewinds the tape and slowly goes frame-by-frame on the closeup of DEAN. He starts back when DEAN eyes flash to black. Then anger flushes SAM's face.]

ACT TWO
[A man works out furiously in his house. His wife and son eat breakfast at the table in the other room. A fax comes in in the office and the son brings it to his father.]


SON

Fax, Dad.


COLE

Who's it from, buddy?


SON

Doesn't say. There's a picture.


COLE

Thanks a lot, bud.


WIFE

Is it him?


[COLE just looks at the surveillance picture of DEAN and then up at his wife. She begins to cry. COLE begins to pack an arsenal of weapons into a military duffel bag.]

[HANNAH and CAS pull over at the side of a highway.]


CASTIEL

I didn't know angels could get nauseous.


HANNAH

I just need a moment.


CASTIEL

It's my fault. I'll take the curves faster.


HANNAH

And you, Castiel? You're feeling well?


CASTIEL

Oh, yes. Like a million dollars.


HANNAH

That's not true.


CASTIEL

It's my truth.


HANNAH

When you left heaven, your borrowed Grace was failing. By the looks of you, you've only gotten worse.


CASTIEL

I'm fine.


HANNAH

You're dying, Castiel. You need more Grace.


CASTIEL

And we have a mission in front of us that supersedes my needs -- all of our needs. Don't you agree? You're a good soldier, Hannah... And one of the best. Metatron certainly could not have been brought to heel without your bravery.


HANNAH

Or yours. You must take care of yourself, Castiel.


CASTIEL [lashing out]

And another angel should die so that I can be saved?! Is this really that hard to understand?


Hannah.


HANNAH [getting back into the car]


I'm feeling better now.


[SAM is questioning the attendant, MICKEY, at the Gas-in-Sip]


MICKEY

Oh, yeah. Porn guy was an animal. Bro came at him like, “what?!” and he was all like, “wh-a-a-at?” “say my name! Say my name! Say my name.” And there was a lot of blood.


SAM

Right. Um...When the guy, uh -- when -- “Porn guy” came in, did he...say anything?


MICKEY

“W-where's the porn”.


SAM

That's all he said? Did he buy anything? Did he -- did he use a credit card? Nothing?


[MICKEY stares at SAM blankly]


So some guy comes in, kills another guy in your store on your watch, and you just -- you what? Just keep on keepin' on?


MICKEY

You mean when porn guy was stabbing the other guy to death 10 feet in front of me, and I was having a total code-brown moment in my favorite freakin' pants because I thought I was next, did I conduct a field interview?...No.


[MICKEY pulls a phone from behind the counter.]

Oh, hey. Uh, can you do me a solid? Found this wedged under the T.P. I think it's the dead guy's phone, and, uh, if you're heading back to the station...


[SAM stands outside the Gas-in-Sip scrolling through Drew Neely's phone. He pulls up a text message that reads "Winchester. Amherst Junction, WI Gas n' Sip B/W 11a-12p. Long live Abaddon." SAM calls the number.]


[A phone rings next to CROWLEY as he watches DEAN playing darts in the bar. He looks at the ID and then picks it up]


CROWLEY

You're dead.


SAM

Nope. Just using a dead man's phone.


CROWLEY

Moose. Took you long enough. Your brother and I were beginning to wonder if you'd hit another dog. You know?


SAM

My brother is dead, Crowley. I know you have some freaking demon parading around in his meatsuit, and trust me, you are gonna pay for that.


CROWLEY

Moose. Moose. I'm afraid you haven't allowed yourself to dream quite big enough here. Your brother is very much alive, courtesy of the mark. And the only demonized soul inside of Dean is his and his alone.

Wee bit more twisted, a little more mangled beyond human recognition, but, I can assure you, all his. There, now. Feel better?


SAM

And the, uh, Abaddon supporters you've been sending to kill my brother, how does Dean feel about that double-cross?


CROWLEY

If that's what you think is happening, then you're more out of your depths than I thought.


SAM

I don't know how you did this, what kind of... Black-magic stunt you pulled, but hear me --I will save my brother or die trying.


CROWLEY

You know what tickles me about all this? It's what's really eating you up. You don't care that he's a demon. Heck, you've been a demon. We've all been demons. No, it's that he's with me and he's having

the time of his life. You can't stand the fact that he's mine.

SAM

He's not your pet.

CROWLEY

My pet? He's my best friend, my partner in crime. They'll write songs about us, graphic novels. “The Misadventures of Growley and Squirrel." Dean Winchester completes me, and that's what makes you lose your chickens.

SAM

I am going to find you, I am going to save my brother, and then I'm going to kill you dead.

CROWLEY

Well, that's the operative phrase, isn't it? “Find you.” good luck with that.


[CROWLEY hangs up the phone and SAM looks at his. SAM then lays the phone next to his own on the hood of the car. SAM's phone has traced the call and it reveals they are at The Black Spur in North Dakota]


ACT THREE
[CASTIEL and HANNAH pull up to a camping site. They get out and find DANIEL fishing in the river.]


CASTIEL

Daniel. What are you fishing for?


DANIEL

Trout, mostly. They do love a good curlytail grub. Trick is to find that special spot just outside the run, where the big ones -- the smart ones -- are holding low.


CASTIEL

Do they -- do they put up much of a fight?


DANIEL

The ones who truly want to be free? They do. You're here about our brother who died.


CASTIEL

Does that surprise you?


DANIEL

I can assure you...Had he just left us alone, no one would've been harmed.


HANNAH

His orders were to not leave you alone. And you killed him.


DANIEL

And heaven sends two more. What is it about us angels that we can't seem to get the message?


HANNAH

Perhaps it is you who has failed to get the message? All of us serve at heaven's command.


DANIEL

I suppose. But that was before the fall, wasn't it?


HANNAH

You are an angel, once and forever.


DANIEL

Dropped unwillingly...Unknowingly...Into a strange land, a land that, as it turns out, celebrates the free, the individual. For the first time in thousands of years, I have choices. And with each choice... I begin to discover who I really am.


HANNAH

This is nonsense.


DANIEL

Because they don't teach you this in heaven? Perhaps they should. Then you would understand why it's worth fighting for.


HANNAH [drawing her angel blade]

He's taunting us.


CASTIEL

And then what? We kill him?


HANNAH

Or he kills us? There are orders.


CASTIEL

And there is time.


HANNAH

To hear more of this?


CASTIEL

To convince him to do the right thing. Besides, Hannah, we still don't even know where the other one is --the woman.


DANIEL

You'll have to stay for sunset. Nighttime around here is a revelation.


[DEAN is sitting at the bar with CROWLEY]


DEAN

You sent those demons to kill me?


CROWLEY

To keep you sharp.


DEAN

Really?


CROWLEY

If it wasn't for me throwing demon chum your way, what do you think would've happened? The mark needs to be sated. Otherwise --


DEAN

otherwise, I turn into a demon. Yeah, yeah. I sort of got that six weeks ago.


CROWLEY

Just trying to help.


DEAN

You lied.


CROWLEY

Who do you think you're talking to here? Does the tin man have a sheet-metal Willy? Of course I lied.


DEAN [getting up]

Okay.


CROWLEY

Hey. Sit down. Sit.


[DEAN just stares at him]


CROWLEY

I needed to keep you sharp for our future, about which we need to talk.


DEAN

Our future?


CROWLEY

Our professional future. How to put this? If I have to spend one more night in this fetid petri dish of broken dreams and B.O., I will cut off my own face.


DEAN [sitting back down]

I don't know what you're talking about. 'Cause I'm good. Hell, I'm great.


CROWLEY

Really? How many suicide wings can you eat? How many one-hit wonders can you karaoke to death?


DEAN

Okay, see, the deal was we howl at the moon -- no time stamp, no expiration date.


CROWLEY

We've howled. We've bayed. We've done extraordinary things to triplets, all of which have been massively entertaining. I will treasure our Flickr albums forever. But now it's time for us to accept what we are and go back to work.


DEAN

Pass.


CROWLEY

Think of it --the king of hell, Dean Winchester by his side. Together we rule. Together we create the perfect hell. And all of this that's bloomed between us never ends. We're not ending the party. We're just moving the party. Out with the club circuit, in with the stadium tour.

Oh.

Did I forget to mention I spoke to moose earlier?


DEAN

What?


CROWLEY

Yes. Uh, apparently, he's been tracking us for some time now. He got my text from the cell of that demon that you stabbed in blah, blah, blah. It was --words were spoken -- emotions. I realize, in retrospect, perhaps too many words, too many emotions.


DEAN

He traced the call.


CROWLEY

My bad. I guess he'll be here by morning -- the latest.


DEAN

You sold me out. Well, that's just lovely.


CROWLEY

I don't know what's going on with you. I truly don't. But I've had just about enough of it. Sold you out? Try “doing you a favor.” everything I've done for you for the past six months -- the mark, the First Blade,

midwifing you back to life, offering you a seat by my side -- has been a favor, a gift, whether you see it or you don't. Take the night. Decide. You know where to find me.


[SAM is driving down the road at night when suddenly his car dies. He pulls the car over to the side and gets out. He struggles to open the hood with only one arm. Another car pulls up behind him and COLE gets out and appoaches.]


COLE

Hey. Need some help?


SAM

Uh...Yeah. I-I think so. It just died on me.


COLE

Out here?


SAM

Yeah.


COLE

Your ride really has it out for you, huh?


SAM

I guess so.


COLE [motioning at the hood]


Give you a hand with that?


SAM

Yeah. Yeah, I'd appreciate it. Yeah. Thanks.


COLE [lifts the hood]

Ah...These new cars and their computerized brains, huh? One zero out of place, and the whole thing just goes kaput. Well, right there. There's your problem.


SAM

What the hell is that?


COLE

Well, that's a kill switch. This here is the remote. [holds it up in his hand]


[SAM jumps to defend himself but his right arm is in a sling and he isn't fast enough to avoid COLE's knockout punch.]


COLE

Guessing you're a righty.


ACT FOUR
[DEAN again is singing karaoke terribly and drinking heavily.]

CROWD

- Tone deaf! Awful!

- Enough!


DEAN

You all suck.


[Security comes to remove him from the stage and DEAN knocks him out.]

[DEAN wakes up in a bed still hammered and ANNEMARIE is there to hand him a glass of water.]


ANNEMARIE

Drink, tough guy.


DEAN [pushing the glass away]

Nah, I'm good.


ANNEMARIE

Your funeral.


DEAN

Mm.


ANNEMARIE

What?


DEAN

Let's go somewhere, you and me.


ANNEMARIE

We are somewhere.


DEAN

No. Somewhere else.


ANNEMARIE

Sweetie... We barely know each other. And you're drunk.


DEAN

Yeah, but, uh... I-I protected your honor, didn't I?


ANNEMARIE

Yeah. I thought so, too. Seeing you take on Matt, I was like, “wow”" no one's ever done that for me before. But then you kept going and going, and I realized whatever is going on with you has nothing to do with my “honor” at all.


DEAN

Hm. You got all that from a bar fight? Wow. You're good.


ANNEMARIE

I wait tables at a roadhouse. I meet the bad guys. I meet the good guys. And maybe for a second there, I thought you were a good guy playing bad. I don't know. It doesn't matter. Maybe you're just --


DEAN

The kind of guy who sleeps with every skank in every small-town dive that he passes through? Well, you really do know how to read people, 'cause that sure as hell sounds like me.


ANNEMARIE

Now, see? I'm so screwed up myself I'm gonna walk out of here thinking I actually deserved that.


[CASTIEL, HANNAH and DANIEL are sitting around a campfire]


DANIEL

What I'll never understand is why angels won't acknowledge the wisdom to be found down here.


HANNAH

What wisdom is to be gained from humans?


DANIEL

I'm not speaking to you.


HANNAH

Do you understand what he's... Fine. But if you are to be free, that is to be decided by all angels.


DANIEL

There's that angelic irony.


ADINA

We're not going back there. Not ever.


DANIEL

Adina. This is Hannah and Castiel. Stow the blade, please.


ADINA

When she stows hers.


CASTIEL

Hannah, what are you doing?


ADINA

We'll never get a chance to argue our freedom from a prison cell.


HANNAH

You should've thought of that before slaughtering one of your own.


DANIEL

No, no. We were talking. We were getting somewhere.


CASTIEL

Okay, everybody just --


HANNAH

You want to be free? Go ahead. Be free.


CASTIEL

Hannah. Stop this. No. Daniel. No!


[They fight. HANNAH gets hurt. CASTIEL kills DANIEL. ADINA runs away.]


HANNAH

We have to get her.


CASTIEL

She's gone.


HANNAH

We have to.


CASTIEL

Hannah. It's over.


[COLE leads a blindfolded SAM into a barn. He roughly shoves him into a chair and zipties his legs to the chair. He then whips the hood off SAM's head. SAM's nose is bleeding and he blinks in the sudden light.]


COLE

Okay. Home, sweet home. Breathe. There you go. You good, partner? How's that chicken wing?


SAM

Who are you?


COLE

First time I broke my arm, my older brother, Davey, had me riding on the handles of his three-speed. Decided to pop us a wheelie, look real fancy for all the little pretties outside the DQ. Well, we were looking mighty good for a little bit. And then, “whoop”" ass end over teakettle, boy. Hurt like a son of a bitch.


You're Sam Winchester. I think we both can agree on that. And your older brother, Dean, well... He and I, we go way back.


SAM

You're a hunter?


COLE

Sure. Yeah, we can go with that. Hunting your brother counts, right?


SAM

I wouldn't do that.


COLE

Yeah?


SAM

Trust me. Look, buddy, I-I don't know who you are, all right? I don't what you want or what my brother did, but if you got any sense, I suggest you turn tail and run back to that army recruiting ad that spit you out in the first place. He's a monster.


COLE

Well, he was. Yeah, he was... Many, many moons ago. But now he's prey. And I'm the monster now.


ACT FIVE
[HANNAH and CASTIEL discuss as they drive away from the campsite.]


HANNAH

We have to report this.


CASTIEL

And say what? Things got out of control? Another angel has died.


HANNAH

He was going to kill me, Castiel.


CASTIEL

They just wanted to be left alone.


HANNAH

Without rules, there is chaos. Out of chaos rise angels like Naomi, Bartholomew...Metatron.


CASTIEL

Well, perhaps I've been down here with them for too long. There's seemingly nothing but chaos. But not all bad comes from it. Art. Hope. Love. Dreams.


HANNAH

But t-those are human things.


CASTIEL

Yes.


[DEAN drives the IMPALA in the dark. His phone starts to ring beside him. The caller ID says 'SAM' He holds it and then finally answers it]


DEAN

I left you an open tab at the bar. Knock yourself out.


COLE

Well, hell, I just may take you up on that.


DEAN

And who is this?


COLE

Me? Well, I'm karma, brother.


DEAN

On my brother's phone?


COLE

On your brother's phone.


DEAN

Is he dead?


COLE

No. Not yet. And as long as you show up where I tell you to show up, your brother will be just fine.


DEAN

And how do I know he's still alive?


COLE [holding the phone out to SAM]

Speak.


[SAM just looks at the phone with heartbroken eyes and doesn't say a word. COLE punches SAM in the face and his head snaps back with a grunt of pain.]


SAM

Aah!


COLE

Proof of life.


SAM

Dean!


COLE

Got a pen?


DEAN

No, you listen to me. There's no trade. There's no meet-up. There's no nothing -- except the 100% guarantee that, somewhere down the road, I will find you, and I will kill you.


COLE

Well, that'll be a cold comfort to your dead brother.


DEAN

I told him to let me go. So whatever jam he's in now, that is his problem.


COLE

Yeah, well, I'll be sure to pass that on to him as I'm slitting his throat.


DEAN

Yeah, you do that, 'cause he knows me. And he knows damn sure that if I am one thing, I am a man of my word.


[DEAN hangs up the phone and COLE is left standing in the barn.]
