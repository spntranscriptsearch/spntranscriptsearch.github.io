TEASER
INTERIOR. BAR.

MANNING, COLORADO

MUSIC: Stevie Ray Vaughan - The House Is Rockin'

Shot of the bar covered in newspapers, someone's hands turning the pages of a hunter's journal.

BARMAID
(gently) Mr Elkins?

MR ELKINS is totally focused on the journal.

BARMAID
Mr Elkins, would you like another?

ELKINS (Looking up) Yeah. Thanks Beth.

MAN AT THE BAR
(To Beth) Thought they caught the Unabomber.

BETH
Yeah, poor Mr Elkins lives all alone, up the canyon. Sits here every day, going through his papers, making his little notes. He's a nice old man; he's just a nut.

BETH
(Pouring another shot for ELKIN) Here you go.

ELKINS looks up. One woman and three men have enter the bar. They survey the room before moving to the bar. ELKINS watches them.

BETH
What'll you have?

WOMAN
Jack all around, leave the bottle.

BETH
You hungry?

WOMAN
We have dinner plans.

BETH
Ok.

BETH
(turning to grab a bottle of jack) Can I get you something else Mr Elkins?

She turns to find his place empty.

...................................

EXTERIOR. COUNTRY CABIN.

ELKINS parks and hurries to the door, looking behind him as he struggles with the key. Once inside he dumps his papers on the desk, then freezes. He slowly turns to see the woman from the bar.

WOMAN
It's been a while. I gotta say, you look old.

ELKINS: What do you want?

WOMAN: What do you think?

He throws a knife which hits the dead center of her chest. She looks down.

WOMAN (Pulling knife out) Damn. You can do better than that.

Her eyes flash and she smiles. ELKINS hurries into the other room, locking the door and pushing a heavy bookcase across it. He opens a cupboard to reveal a safe and begins the combination.

ELKINS
Ah, come on ,come on.

There is banging on the door. He removes a metal box from the safe and opens it to reveal an old-fashioned gun. He begins to load it. The banging continues.

Two men drop through the roof and leap over the desk to grab ELKIN. The gun falls to the floor. The bookcase barricading the door falls and the woman walks though. The WOMAN picks the gun up from the floor and examines it.

WOMAN
Nice gun. Wouldn't do you much good of course. Boys, we're eating in tonight.

The men fall on ELKINS. He screams. (They are vampires.)

ACT ONE
INTERIOR. DAY. CAFE

DEAN is flipping through a newspaper, SAM on his laptop.

DEAN
(folding the paper) Well dude. Not a decent lead in all of Nebraska. What've you got?

SAM
Well, I've been scanning Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota. Here. A woman in Iowa fell 10,000 feet from an airplane and survived.

DEAN
Sounds more like 'That's Incredible' than, uh, 'Twilight Zone'. See Trivia and References section 1.20 Dead Man's Blood

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
(Smirking) Hey you know we could just keep heading east. New York. Upstate. We could drop by and see Sarah again. Huh? 1.19 Provenance Cool chick man, smokin'. (he whistles) You two seemed pretty friendly. What do you say?

SAM
Yeah, I dunno, maybe someday. But in the meantime we got a lot of work to do Dean, and you know that.

DEAN
Yeah all right. What else you got?

SAM
Ahh, man in Colorado, local man named Daniel Elkins, was found mauled in his home.

DEAN
Elkins? I know that name.

SAM
Doesn't ring a bell.

DEAN
(under his breath) Elkins...Elkins...Elkins.

SAM
Sounds like the police don't know what to think. At first they said it was some sort of bear attack and now, they've found some signs of robbery.

DEAN
Mm-hmm. (Starts flicking through John's journal) There, check it out.

DEAN hands the journal to SAM and points. 'D Elkins 970-555-0158' Daniel Elkins

SAM
You think it's the same Elkins?

DEAN
It's a Colorado area code.

........................

The Impala cruises down the road, snow-capped mountains in the background.

........................

INTERIOR. ELKINS CABIN. NIGHT

The door opens slowly to reveal SAM putting away his lock pick, DEAN with a flashlight.

DEAN
(Looking around at the mess) Looks like the maid didn't come today.

SAM
Hey, there's salt over here. Right beside the door.

DEAN
(flicking through ELKINS' journal) You mean protection against demon salt, or 'oops I spilled the popcorn' salt.

SAM
It's clearly a ring. You think this guy Elkins was a player?

DEAN
Definitely.

SAM
(coming up behind DEAN) That looks a hell of a lot like Dad's.

DEAN
Yep, except this dates back to the 60s.

Shot of outside. A man is standing in the shadows of a large tree, looking at the cabin.

SAM and DEAN move into the other room and shine their flashlights around the destruction, including up at the hole in the roof.

SAM
Whatever attacked him, it looks like there was more than one.

DEAN
Looks like he put up a hell of a fight too.

SAM
Yeah.

They look around the room. DEAN crouches to get a closer look at the floor.

SAM
You got something?

DEAN
I dunno. Some scratches on the floor.

SAM
Death throes maybe?

DEAN
Yeah, maybe.

DEAN grabs a page from a notebook, places it over the marks and rubs a pencil lead over it to get an outline.

DEAN
Or maybe a message.

DEAN
(Dean peels up the paper, which has a lot of blood on the back, and rubbings of characters; he hands the paper to SAM) Look familiar?

SAM
Three letters, six digits. The location and combination of a post office box. It's a mail drop.

DEAN
Just the way Dad does it.

..........................

INTERIOR. POST OFFICE. NIGHT

DEAN opens the post office box, SAM at his side. He removes a letter, stares, and shows it to SAM. They look at each other, confused.

..........................

INTERIOR. IMPALA. NIGHT

SAM
'J.W.' You think? John Winchester?

DEAN
I don't know. Should we open it?

There is a knock on DEAN's window. DEAN gasps, rears back, automatically raising his arm, fist clenched. It's John Winchester. When JOHN sees he has shocked them he smiles.

DEAN
Dad?

JOHN gets in the backseat.

SAM
Dad, what are you doing here? Are you all right?

JOHN
Yeah, I'm ok. I read the news about Daniel, I got here as fast as I could. I saw you two at his place.

SAM
(softly) Why didn't you come in Dad?

JOHN
You know why. Because I had to make sure you weren't followed.... by anyone or anything. Nice job of covering your tracks by the way.

DEAN
(looking a little proud) Yeah, well, we learned from the best.

SAM
Wait, you came all the way out here for this Elkins guy?

JOHN
Yeah. He was... he was a good man. He taught me a hell of a lot about hunting.

SAM
Well you never mentioned him to us.

JOHN
We had a... we had kind of a falling out. I hadn't seen him in years. (gesturing to the envelope) I should look at that. (He opens it) 'If you're reading this, I'm already dead'... that son of a bitch.

DEAN
What is it?

JOHN
He had it the whole time.

SAM
Dad, what?

JOHN
When you searched the place, did you, did you see a gun? An antique, a Colt revolver, did you see it?

DEAN
Ah, there was, there was an old case but it was empty.

JOHN
They have it.

DEAN
You mean whatever killed Elkins?

JOHN
(starting to get out of the car) We gotta pick up the trail.

SAM
Wait. You want us to come with you?

JOHN
If Elkins was telling the truth, we gotta find this gun.

SAM
The gun -- why?

JOHN
Because it's important, that's why.

SAM
Dad, we don't even know what these things are yet.

JOHN
They were what Daniel Elkins killed best: Vampires.

DEAN
Vampires? I thought there was no such thing.

SAM
You never even mentioned them, Dad.

JOHN
I thought they were extinct. I thought Elkins and -- and others had wiped them out. I was wrong.

VOICEOVER BY JOHN. Vision is of the Vampires from earlier drinking by a car.

Most vampire lore is crap. A cross won't repel them, sunlight won't kill them, and neither will a stake to the heart. But the bloodlust, that part's true. They need fresh human blood to survive. They were once people, so you won't know it's a vampire until it's too late.

A car comes along the road toward the vampires.

WOMAN VAMPIRE
(throwing away the empty bottle to smash on the road) All yours, baby.

In the car a young man drives, a young woman in the passenger seat.

WOMAN
(laughing) Well I bet you showed that guy.

GUY
What guy?

WOMAN
The one that bet you wouldn't buy that shirt.

GUY
(looking at her) I love this shirt.

She shakes her head, smiling, and turns back to face the road. The guy continues smiling at her. She sees a man lying in the road.

WOMAN
No, look out!!

The guy slams on the brakes.

WOMAN
What happened to him?

GUY
Call 911.

The guy goes to the man on the road as the girl opens her phone. He turns the man's face to him. His eyes open, as does his mouth and a mouthful of fangs descend from his gums. He grabs the young guy.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
The camera pans across SAM and DEAN sleeping peacefully in a motel room.


DISPATCHER
Unit 22 let me confirm. Mile marker 41,abandoned car. You need a workup?

MAN ON SCENE
Copy that. Possible 207. Better get forensics out here.

The camera stops on JOHN, sitting at the table with a radio held in both hands. He puts it down, jumps to his feet and grabs his jacket.

JOHN
(slapping feet as he calls their name) Sam, Dean, let's go.

DEAN
(Immediately, although still asleep) Mm-hmm.

SAM half sits up. DEAN starts rubbing his eyes.

JOHN
I picked up a police call.

SAM
What happened?

JOHN
A couple called 911, found a body in the street. Cops got there everyone was missing. It's the vampires.

SAM
(rising from the bed) How do you know?

JOHN
(as he leaves) Just follow me, ok?

SAM walks across the room, putting his jacket on.

DEAN
(still half asleep) Huh, vampires. Get's funnier every time I hear it.

................................

EXTERIOR. DAY.

JOHN finishes talking to a cop on the scene and starts walking back to the boys, waiting by the Impala.

SAM
(slightly sulky) I don't see why we couldn't have gone over with him.

DEAN
Oh don't tell me it's already starting.

SAM
What's starting?
DEAN
(To John) What have you got?

JOHN
It was them all right. Looks like they're heading west. We'll have to double back to get around that detour.

SAM
How can you be so sure?

DEAN
Sam...

SAM
(Sharply to Dean) I just wanna know we're going in the right direction.

JOHN
We are.

SAM
How do you know?

JOHN
(Handing something to Dean) I found this.

DEAN
It's a....a vampire fang.

JOHN
Not fangs, teeth. The second set decends when they attack.

JOHN
(looks at Sam) Any more questions?

Sam looks away and stays silent.

JOHN
All right, let's get out of here, we're losing daylight.

They start heading for their respective cars.

JOHN
Hey Dean why don't you touch up your car before you get rust? I wouldn't have given you the damn thing if I thought you were going to ruin it.

DEAN looks down at his car. SAM looks at DEAN with a 'told you so' look on his face. DEAN grimaces.

..................

INTERIOR. IMPALA.

SAM is driving, following JOHN's truck.

DEAN
(Reading) Vampires nest in groups of eight to ten. Smaller packs are sent to hunt for food. Victims are taken to the nest where the pack keeps them alive, bleeding them for days or weeks.
I wonder if that's what happened to that 911 couple.

SAM
(Grumpily) That's probably what Dad's thinking. Course it would be nice if he just told us what he thinks.

DEAN
So it is starting.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Sam, we've been looking for Dad all year. Now we're not with him for more than a couple of hours and there's static already?

SAM
Hmph. No. Look, I'm happy he's ok, all right? And I'm happy that we're all working together again.

DEAN
Well good.

SAM
(Unable to help himself) It's just the way he treats us, like we're children.

DEAN
Oh God.

SAM
He barks orders at us Dean, he expects us to follow 'em without question. He keeps us on some crap need-to-know deal.

DEAN
He does what he does for a reason.

SAM
What reason?

DEAN
Our job! There's no time to argue, there's no margin for error, all right? That's just the way the old man runs things.

SAM
Yeah well maybe that worked when we were kids but not anymore, all right. Not after everything you and I have been through, Dean. I mean, are you telling me you're cool with just falling into line, and letting him run the whole show? (looks at Dean challengingly)

DEAN
(Giving Sam a long look; weakly, as if he's convincing himself) If that's what it takes.

Sam shakes his head.

............................

INTERIOR. BARN. THE VAMPIRE'S NEST.

The vamps are partying, drinking and dancing. The 911 couple are sitting tied to a pole.

VAMP
Have some beer, buddy. It will calm your nerves.

GUY
No thanks.

VAMP
Aww come on. You drink enough I can taste it in your blood.

WOMAN VAMP
(walking up behind) That's gross.

VAMP
How 'bout you babe?

He lifts the bottle to the WOMAN's mouth and forces her head up with it. She drinks.

VAMP
Atta girl.

She spits it back in his face. He wipes it with his sleeve then lifts his arm to backhand her.

WOMAN VAMP

Bo! Wait for Luther.

BO glares and walks away. The door opens and the LUTHER walks in. WOMAN VAMP throws herself on him and they kiss.

LUTHER
(laughing) I missed you too, baby.

WOMAN VAMP
We got presents.

LUTHER (Stroking the woman's face) She looks interesting. (Grabbing the guy's face) He doesn't. Lock him up.

The other vamps pull the guy to his feet.

LUTHER
On second thought -- go ahead and treat yourself.

The vamps laugh, excited. They throw the guy down and fall on him. The woman sobs, terrified, as the guy screams.

WOMAN VAMP
(To LUTHER) There's something else.

She leads him to the bar where cash and silver are heaped.

LUTHER
This all theirs?

WOMAN
(smiling) No. It's from an old friend of yours, Daniel Elkins. I caught his scent and thought I'd surprise you.

LUTHER
(Concerned) Kate, what did you do?

KATE
I made him suffer.

LUTHER
You shouldn't have done that.

KATE
Luther...

LUTHER
There's others like him. They'll know the signs and come looking for us. We have to be careful.

KATE
Luther I did it for you, for what he did to your family.

LUTHER
Revenge isn't worth much if you end up dead.

KATE
I'm sorry babe. I'm sorry.

LUTHER picks up the gun.

KATE
I thought you might like that. It looks like it was made around the time you were born.

LUTHER
I've seen this before.

KATE
Elkins died with it in his hands. He should have known better. Using a gun.

LUTHER
This is no ordinary gun.

.................................

INTERIOR. IMPALA. NIGHT.

SAM is driving.

DEAN
(on phone) Yeah Dad. All right, got it. (hangs up) Pull off at the next exit.

SAM
(Angry) Why.

DEAN
Cause Dad thinks we've got the vampire's trail.

SAM
(very angry) How.

DEAN
I don't know; he didn't say.

SAM guns the engine, DEAN looks at him like he's crazy. DEAN turns to look at JOHN'S truck as SAM overtakes it and passes it. Once in front SAM slams on the brakes, causing the Impala to swerve sideways in front of JOHN's truck. They both stop.

DEAN Oh crap. Here we go. (As SAM gets out of his car) Sam! (Dean follows out of the car.)

SAM and JOHN, who is also out of his truck, both looking angry.

DEAN
(following) Sam!

JOHN
What the hell was that.

SAM
We need to talk.

JOHN
(coming to a halt face to face with SAM) About what?

SAM
About everything. Where we going Dad. What's the big deal about this gun.

DEAN
Sammy, come on, we can Q and A after we kill all the vampires.

JOHN
Your brother's right, we don't have time for this.

SAM
Last time we saw you, you said it was too dangerous for us to be together. Now out of the blue you need our help. (yelling) Now obviously something big is going down, and we wanna know what!

JOHN
Get back in the car.

SAM
No.

JOHN
I said get back in the damn car.

SAM
Yeah. And I said no.

DEAN
(Hovering) Ok you made your point tough guy. Look we're all tired, we can talk about this later. Sammy, I mean it, come on.

DEAN grabs SAM and pushes him back toward the car. SAM goes, still staring at JOHN.

SAM
(mumbles) This is why I left in the first place.

JOHN
What'd you say?

SAM
(swinging back) You heard me.

JOHN
Yeah. You left. Your brother and me, we needed you. You walked away, Sam.

DEAN
Sam...

JOHN
(Yelling in SAM'S face) You walked away!!

DEAN
Stop it, both of you.

SAM
You're the one who said don't come back Dad, you closed that door not me. You were just pissed off that you couldn't control me anymore!

DEAN
(Forcing them apart) Listen, stop it, stop it. Stop it!! That's enough!!

SAM and JOHN stare at each other over DEAN'S head.

DEAN
(Looking at JOHN) That means you too.

SAM gets into the Impala. JOHN turns back to his car. DEAN stands in the middle, alone. He looks from one to the other.

DEAN
(to the night air) Terrific.

.........................

INTERIOR. BARN. VAMPIRES NEST.

KATE and LUTHER get it on against the bar. The 911 woman is still tied up, trying not to watch as LUTHER removes KATE'S shirt.

They both turn to look at the woman.

LUTHER
You like to watch huh? me too. (to KATE) Ready baby?

They turn to face the woman.

WOMAN (sobbing)
Are you going to kill me?

KATE
I'm going to take you so high you're never going to come down.

LUTHER cuts KATE'S arm with his knife. KATE sucks on it then goes to the girl, kissing her and forcing blood into her mouth as LUTHER watches.

LUTHER
Welcome home baby.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXTERIOR. VAMPIRES NEST. DAY

From the trees we watch as a beat up Camaro pulls in. LUTHER, in a t-shirt, comes out to meet it, holding the door open and shading his eyes from the sun.

VAMP
(to LUTHER) I know what time it is.

LUTHER
Get in.

Luther looks around then goes back inside.

DEAN
(Hiding in the trees with JOHN and SAM) Son of a bitch. So they're really not afraid of the sun?

JOHN
Ahh, direct sunlight hurts like a nasty sunburn. The only way to kill 'em is by beheading. And yeah, they sleep during the day -- doesn't mean they won't wake up.

DEAN
So I guess walking right in's not our best option.

JOHN
Actually, that's the plan.

Cut to DEAN opening the trunk. The boys weapon up while JOHN does the same from an automatic hidden compartment that slides from the back of his truck.

DEAN
(Looking over) Dad, I've got an extra machete if you need one.

DEAN holds it up but JOHN unveils a massive shiny serrated edge machete from a leather holder.

JOHN
I think I'm ok. Thanks.

DEAN
(Checking it out) Wow.

JOHN
So, you boys really wanna know about this Colt?

SAM
Yes sir.

JOHN
It's just a story, a legend really. Well I thought it was. Never really believed it until I read Daniel's letter....

Scene cuts to a man making the gun and numbered bullets, carving a devil's trap into the handle.

JOHN. VOICEOVER.
Back in 1835, when Halley's comet was overhead, the same night those men died at the Alamo. They say Samuel Colt made a gun. A special gun. He made it for a hunter, a man like us only on horseback. Story goes he made thirteen bullets, and this hunter used the gun a half dozen times before he disappeared, the gun along with him. And somehow Daniel got his hands on it.

Back to the present.

JOHN
They say... they say this gun can kill anything.

DEAN
Kill anything like, supernatural anything?

SAM
Like the demon.

JOHN
Yeah, the demon. Ever since I picked up its trail I've been looking for a way to destroy that thing. Find the gun -- we may have it.

....................

INTERIOR. BARN. VAMPIRE'S NEST

A barn window swings inwards. JOHN jumps through and disappears. SAM follows, then DEAN. They survey the room. Vamps are sleeping in hammocks. All is quiet.

...............................

JOHN looks into the stalls. SAM and DEAN make their way through the barn. As DEAN passes a hammock he kicks an empty bottle on the ground. It clinks but the vampire doesn't wake.

..............................

At the back of the barn JOHN finds KATE and LUTHER asleep on a bed in an alcove. The gun hangs in a holster beside them.

...............................

SAM finds the 911 woman tied up against the pole, sleeping or unconscious.

SAM
(whispering) Dean.

...............................

JOHN slowly makes his way down a few steps to the bed. LUTHER turns over in his sleep.

...............................

Sam begins to untie the woman. They hear a noise.

DEAN
(looking behind them) There's more.

DEAN makes his way to a locked metal grid. Inside people are tied up, also sleeping or unconscious. There is a lock on the door. He grabs a metal hook to break the lock. SAM looks up sharply at the noise and they look over to the hammocks. There is no movement.

...............................

JOHN approaches the gun.

...............................

The woman tied up against the pole begins to stir.

SAM
(whispers) Hey. Hey hey, shh, I'm here to help you.

The woman roars, an unearthly roar. SAM rears back, DEAN looks around. The vampires wake.

DEAN
Sam!

...............................

JOHN turns toward the noise. Beside him LUTHER and KATE wake. LUTHER rears up and throws him against the wall. JOHN grabs a rock and hurls it at the blackened window, letting in the daylight. LUTHER and KATE flinch away.

JOHN
Boys, run!

................................

SAM and DEAN run, calling to their Dad as they do. The vampires give chase. SAM and DEAN burst out the barn doors into the daylight and run up the slope to the cars before turning to look back.

DEAN
Dad? (nothing) Dad!!

After a long pause JOHN comes running up the slope. As soon as they see him the boys turn to leave.

JOHN
They won't follow. They'll wait till tonight. Once a vampire has your scent, it's for life.

DEAN
Well what the hell do we do now?

JOHN
You gotta find the nearest funeral home, that's what.

The boys look at him, confused, then at each other.

................................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

SAM paces, JOHN sits at the table.

SAM
It shouldn't be taking this long. I should go help.

JOHN
Dean's got it.

JOHN watches SAM pace.

JOHN
Sammy.

SAM
Yeah.

JOHN
I don't think I ever told you this but ... the day you were born, you know what I did?

SAM
No.

JOHN
I put a hundred bucks into a savings account for you. I did the same thing for your brother.

It was a college fund. And every month I'd put in another hundred dollars, until... Anyway my point is, Sam, this is never the life that I wanted for you.

SAM
Then why'd you get so mad when I left?

JOHN
You gotta understand something. After your mother passed all I saw was evil, everywhere. And all I cared about was keeping you boys alive. I wanted you...prepared. Ready. Except somewhere along the line I ... uh ... I stopped being your father and I ... I became your, your drill sergeant. So when you said that you wanted to go away to school, all I could think about, my only thought was, that you were gonna be alone. Vulnerable. Sammy, it just... it never occurred to me what you wanted. I just couldn't accept the fact that you and me -- We're just different.

Sam huffs a laugh.

JOHN
What?

SAM
We're not different. Not anymore. With what happened to Mom and Jess... (laughs) Well we probably have a lot more in common than just about anyone.

JOHN
I guess you're right, son. (smiles)

SAM
Hey Dad? Whatever happened to that college fund?

JOHN
Spent it on ammo.

They look at each other. SAM cracks up and so does JOHN.

DEAN enters.
Whew. Man, some heavy security to protect a bunch of dead guys.

JOHN
Get it?

DEAN fumbles in his pocket, withdrawing a paper bag and from that a bottle full of something red. He hands it to JOHN.

JOHN
You know what to do.

.............................

EXTERIOR. ROAD.

DEAN leans over the open bonnet of the Impala, looking at the engine.

WOMAN'S VOICE
Car trouble?

DEAN turns to see KATE.

KATE
Let me give you a lift. I'll take you back to my place.

DEAN
(grinning) Nah I'll pass. I usually draw the line at necrophilia.

KATE
Oooh.

She backhands him. Another vamp approaches. She grabs his face and lifts him into the air.

DEAN
(Grabbing her wrist) I don't usually get this friendly until the second date but...

KATE
You know, we could have some fun. I always like to make new friends.

She lowers him to her level and kisses him, still holding his cheeks tightly.

Another vamp watches, smiling.

DEAN
Oh. Whuf. Sorry. I don't usually stay with a chick that long. Definitely not eternity.

An arrow pieces the other vamp's back. A second later the same happens to KATE.

KATE
(Looking down at the point sticking out of her chest) Dammit.

JOHN and SAM emerge from the trees carrying crossbows.Weapons Catalogue

KATE
It barely even stings.

JOHN
Give it time sweetheart. That arrow's soaked in dead man's blood. It's like poison to you isn't it?

KATE looks shocked, then wavers and loses consciousness.

JOHN
Load her up. (Gestures to the other vamp) I'll take care of this one.

JOHN approaches the other vamp who is sitting groggily on the ground. Raising his machete, he brings it down. Camera cuts to blood spraying over a boulder.


END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
EXTERIOR. NIGHT.

A campfire is burning. JOHN hands DEAN a bag and they move from the Impala's trunk back toward the fire where SAM is patrolling with a machete.

JOHN
Toss this on the fire. Saffron, skunk's cabbage and trillium. It'll block our scent and hers, until we're ready.

DEAN
(sniffing it and coughing) Stuff stinks!

JOHN
That's the idea. Dust your clothes with the ashes, and you stand a chance of not being detected.

SAM
You sure they'll come after 'er?

JOHN
Yeah. Vampires mate for life. She means more to the leader than the gun. But the blood sickness is going to wear off soon, so you don't have a lot of time.

SAM
A half hour oughta do it.

JOHN
And then I want you out of the area as fast as you can.

SAM
But...

DEAN
Well, Dad you can't take care of them all yourself.

JOHN
I'll have her. And the Colt.

SAM
But after. We're gonna meet up, right? Use the gun together. Right?

Long pause.

SAM
You're leaving again ,aren't you. You still wanna go after the demon alone. You know, I don't get you. You can't treat us like this.

JOHN
Like what?
<br

SAM
Like children.

JOHN
You are my children. I'm trying to keep you safe.

DEAN
Dad, all due respect but, uh, that's a bunch of crap.

SAM and JOHN both look at DEAN, shocked.

JOHN
Excuse me?

DEAN
You know what Sammy and I have been hunting. Hell you sent us on a few hunting trips yourself. You can't be that worried about keeping us safe.

JOHN
It's not the same thing, Dean.

DEAN
Then what is it? Why do you want us out of the big fight?

JOHN
This demon? It's a bad son of a bitch. I can't make the same moves if I'm worried about keeping you alive.

DEAN
You mean you can't be as reckless.

JOHN
Look... I don't expect to make it out of this fight in one piece. Your mother's death ... it almost killed me. I can't watch my children die too. I won't.

DEAN
What happens if you die? Dad, what happens if you die, and we coulda done something about it? You know I been thinking. I ...think maybe Sammy's right about this one. We should do this together.

SAM nods.

DEAN
We're stronger as a family, Dad. We just are. You know it.

JOHN
We're running out of time. You do your job and you get out of the area. That's an order.

Dean looks down, emotional. Sam clenches his jaw.

.....................................

EXTERIOR. OUTSIDE VAMP NEST. NIGHT

A vamp pulls up to where LUTHER and the others are waiting and heads towards them.

LUTHER
Is there any sign of those three?

VAMP
No. Something else.

LUTHER
What.

VAMP
Luther, they cut off Frank's head!

LUTHER And Kate?

VAMP
I don't know. She wasn't there. What are we gonna do?

The noise of a car distracts them.

VAMP
It's just a truck up on the highway.

LUTHER
(Whispers) Kate. She's in that truck.

.......................................

EXTERIOR. NIGHT.

JOHN's truck travels down the road. KATE sluggishly opens and closes her eyes in the passenger seat. After a moment headlights shine in the rearview mirror. Two cars approach John's truck quickly from behind.

...................................

VAMP NEST

A vampire swigs from a bottle. Looking up, he moves to stand in front of the barn doors, considers them a moment, then shrugs and takes another swig. He turns to find DEAN WINCHESTER behind him.

DEAN
Boo.

DEAN swings his machete, then makes his way back to the locked container of people.

I told you I'd come back.

He begins breaking the hinges.

..................................

John looks in the rear-view mirror, but the cars have disappeared.

JOHN has to stop when the road is blocked ahead of him by LUTHER, three other vamps, and two cars.

LUTHER
Get out! Who are you?

JOHN
Name's Winchester.

LUTHER
Where are your friends?

JOHN
Cleaning out your nest.

LUTHER smiles tightly.
Where's Kate?

JOHN
(Turning back to the truck) Come here sweetheart.

He pulls a groggy and tied up Kate out, holding a large knife to her throat.

LUTHER
Kate, you all right?

KATE
Dead man's blood.

LUTHER
You son of a bitch.

JOHN
I want the Colt. Elkins gun. Trade.

LUTHER
Is that what this is all about? I mean, you can't shoot us all right? We'll kill you.

JOHN
Oh, I don't need it for you. I'm saving it for something else.

JOHN
Put the colt down, or she goes first.

LUTHER
All right. Just don't hurt her.

LUTHER places the Colt on the ground.

JOHN
Back up. Further.

JOHN drags KATE forward and leans down with her to pick up the gun. KATE works at the ties around her wrists.

LUTHER.
(To JOHN) It's a nice move, you almost made it.

KATE swings around, knocking JOHN back against his truck. He drops the gun. LUTHER approaches, backhanding JOHN back against his open car door, shattering the glass before he lands unconscious on the ground. LUTHER approaches again.

An arrow pierces one of the vamps and SAM and DEAN run out of the trees, DEAN pauses to line up and shoot another vamp with his crossbow. SAM moves toward LUTHER who backhands him. DEAN grabs a machete and turns to help but LUTHER has his arm around SAM'S throat.

LUTHER
Don't! I'll break his neck. Put the blade down.

For a moment DEAN does nothing. LUTHER tightens his hold on SAM's neck, cutting off his air supply completely. DEAN drops the machete.

LUTHER
You people. Why can't you leave us alone. We have as much right to live as you do.

JOHN
(from behind) I don't think so.

LUTHER turns. JOHN raises the colt and shoots him between the eyes. LUTHER lets go of SAM who stumbles away, gasping, and DEAN pulls SAM behind him. A sigil appears where the bullet hit LUTHER and he stumbles. A brief flash of light reflects his skeleton, before he falls to his knees.

KATE cries out in horror:
Lutherrrr!!!!

Another flash of light passes through LUTHER and he slumps to the ground dead.

KATE starts toward JOHN. Another vamp grabs her, pulling her to their car. They take off, wheels screaming. John smiles in satisfaction.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

SAM and DEAN are packing. JOHN enters.

JOHN
So boys.

They turn to face him.

SAM
Yes sir.

JOHN
You ignored a direct order back there.

SAM
Yes sir.

DEAN
Yeah but we saved your ass.

Sam looks sideways at Dean, nervously. John looks steadily at Dean. Dean swallows.

JOHN
You're right.

DEAN
I am?

JOHN
It scares the hell out of me. You two are all I've got. But I guess we are stronger as a family. So...we go after this damn thing. Together.

(theme music starts)

SAM and DEAN (In Unison) Yes sir.
