TEASER
Black Forest, Colorado

INTERIOR – TENT – NIGHT

[A group of young girls sit around in a tent, drinking. JULIE pours out a drink into ASHLEY and the other FRIEND’s cup.]

JULIE

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Spiced rum with cinnamon. I infused it myself.


FRIEND

Bet she learnt that from a podcast.


JULIE

Yes. Yes, I did. And you’re welcome.


FRIEND

To our annual camping trip.


JULIE

To eleven years of not dying from exposure.


ASHLEY

To our last camping trip.


JULIE

Oh God, Ashley. Way to be a downer.


FRIEND

We just graduated from college. Can’t we just celebrate that?


ASHLEY

Yeah, but you two got jobs. You’re both leaving. I… have a philosophy degree. And I drive Uber.


JULIE

Well, you did that to yourself.


[ASHLEY glares at JULIE. The other FRIEND looks at JULIE before looking at ASHLEY.]

FRIEND

She means you picked a harder road. You’ll find something.


JULIE

Just drink the rum. It’ll help.


[ASHLEY takes a sip and coughs before laughing.]

JULIE

See?


[They hear a noise from outside the tent.]

ASHLEY

What was that?


[The other girls laugh at her.]

FRIEND

Look at your face. It’s probably just a deer or something. A deer is not going to kill you.


ASHLEY

That sounded a lot bigger than a deer.


FRIEND

Maybe it’s a really big deer.


ASHLEY

Guys.


JULIE

You’re nuts. There’s nothing out there. Oh my God, I’ll prove it to you, okay?


[JULIE gets up and walks to the opening of the tent.]

JULIE

I’m getting more rum.


[She opens the zipper of the tent and looks at ASHLEY before she leaves.]

FRIEND

Okay. Don’t really think we need more rum.

[They hear JULIE scream.]

FRIEND

Julie?


[They hear grunting noises from outside.]

FRIEND

Julie? Are you okay?


[The other FRIEND motions for ASHLEY to close the tent. ASHLEY shakes her head. The FRIEND gets up and slowly walks to the opening of the tent. She tries to close the zipper, but she gets grabbed and dragged outside. ASHLEY screams.]

ACT ONE
INTERIOR – BUNKER WAR ROOM – NIGHT

[SAM walks into the war room. He puts his shotgun in his duffle bag and looks down at his phone. He has sent several messages to Cas, with no reply. DEAN opens the door to the bunker and walks in. SAM looks up at the stairs.]

DEAN

Supply run is done.


[He walks down the stairs.]

DEAN

Hey. You know they make Ghost Pepper Jerky?


[DEAN shows SAM the packet.]

SAM

Uh, you’re not gonna like it.


DEAN

What’re you talking about? I like all jerkies.


SAM

Dude. Ghost peppers are really hot.


[DEAN sits down at the map table and opens the packet.]

DEAN

Please.

[He takes a bite of the jerky and smiles. He nods in appreciation as he looks at SAM. He turns away and closes his eyes, breathing heavily.]

SAM

How is it?


DEAN

It’s good. It’s really good. I like it. It’s good flavor.


SAM

Great. Uh, you should have another piece.


DEAN

That’s fine.

[SAM takes out a bottle of water from the supply bag.]

SAM

Oh, thank you. Water. You mind if I…?


[DEAN nods. He shakes his head and taps on the table, gesturing towards the bottle. SAM opens it but doesn’t hand it to him.]

SAM

What?


DEAN

Those are…


SAM

What? Huh?


[DEAN gestures to the bottle.]

SAM

Oh, you want… Okay, yeah, sure.


[SAM throws DEAN the bottle. DEAN opens it and takes a long drink.]

DEAN

Mountain lion…


SAM

What? I didn’t really catch that. Will you say it again, please?

[DEAN takes another long drink of water.]

DEAN

Mountain lion… the case in Colorado with the mountain lion… where are we…


SAM

Wait. Say it one more time.

DEAN

The case in Colorado with the mountain lion with the three dead. Where are we with that one?


SAM

Uh… we are at five.


[DEAN tries not to gag.]

DEAN

What?


SAM

We’re up to five.


DEAN

Then what are we doing here?


[DEAN pours the water into his mouth before pouring it over his head.]

DEAN

Oh, sweet mother. I’m gonna go get ready for…


[He spits out the piece of jerky and leaves.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER – NIGHT

[The bunker hallways transition to the library. SAM is sitting at the table, dressed in a white suit. DEAN comes up behind him with the Colt in his hand. He points it at the back of SAM’s head and cocks the gun.]

DEAN

Please forgive me.


[SAM smiles evilly. DEAN pulls the trigger and SAM head falls forward. After a few seconds, he raises his head.]

DEAN

No.


[The gunshot wound on SAM’s forehead heals. His eyes are glowing red. It’s LUCIFER.] LUCIFER/SAM

The Colt. Did you really think that would work? Poor, faithful Dean. We both knew it had to end this way.


[LUCIFER/SAM looks over his shoulder. Flames start to rise and engulf DEAN. He screams. LUCIFER/SAM closes his eyes.]

INTERIOR – IMPALA – NIGHT

[SAM wakes from his dream as car horn blares. He looks at DEAN and around the car.]

DEAN

You okay?


SAM

Yeah, just uh… bad dream.


DEAN

Jeez. Another one? Well, why don’t you tell me about it. Yeah, come on. I’ll Freud you. Keep you awake till we hit Colorado.

SAM

I’m fine.


DEAN

Alright.


EXTERIOR – SHERIFF’S STATION – DAY

[The Impala pulls up outside the Sheriff’s station.]

DEAN

We’re here.


SAM

We going Fed?


DEAN

Nope.


EXTERIOR – SHERIFF’S STATION – DAY

[DEAN and SAM are outside the Impala. The trunk is open and DEAN takes out a snapback cap with a colourful salmon on top.]

DEAN

Fish and Wildlife.


SAM

Fish and Wildlife.


DEAN

Check these bad boys out.


[He hands SAM a badge. SAM looks down at the names.]

SAM

Hamill and Ford? Wow. That is a deep cut.


DEAN

Look at you. You look like a baby.


SAM

Me? Look at you.


[DEAN looks down at his own badge.]

DEAN

What? I look exactly the same.


[SAM glares at DEAN.]

DEAN

Like nothing has changed.


[SAM looks at DEAN again.]

DEAN

Nothing’s changed.


SAM

Yeah. Right.


[SAM walks away as he puts on his jacket.]

INTERIOR – SHERIFF’S STATION – DAY

[SAM and DEAN walk in. The SHERIFF walks over to her desk.]

DEAN

You the sheriff?


SHERIFF

That’s what the mug says.


[She puts the “I’m the sheriff” mug down on the table and sits down.]

DEAN

Fish and Wildlife. Agents Ford and Hamill.


[DEAN and SAM hold out their badges. She looks at DEAN’s and takes it from him. She looks up at him.]

SHERIFF

This you?


DEAN

Obviously.


SHERIFF

Okay.


[She hands the badge back to DEAN. SAM tries not to laugh.]

SAM

We’re here about the five… the mountain lion attacks.


SHERIFF

If that’s what you wanna call ‘em.


DEAN

Is that not what you wanna call ‘em?


SHERIFF

I don’t know. Maybe. We don’t get many big cats around here. Had a few bears, but they don’t do sustained attacks like this. I mean, unless the bear’s psychotic.


DEAN

So, your two theories are mountain lion or… psychotic bear?


SHERIFF

Look. If you ask me, these aren’t animal attacks at all. The scenes are too clean. There’s no parts torn off. We’re still working on this. We had to tell the papers something.


SAM

So, you think a person did this?


SHERIFF

If he did, he’s a monster.


SAM

Yeah. Of course. Either way, we need to be sure. Do you have any case files? Any photographs of the bodies we can look at?


SHERIFF

Sure. I can get you those.


DEAN

And what about witnesses?


SHERIFF

One. Ashley Munroe. She’s not saying much. I think she’s in shock. I mean, having your friends’ heart ripped out will do that. She asked us to keep her name out of the articles. You know, because of the trauma.

SAM

Where is she now?


INTERIOR – HOSPITAL ROOM – NIGHT

[ASHLEY sits up in the hospital bed. She has a large scratch on her left cheek. SAM and DEAN stand in front of her.]

ASHLEY

It all happened so fast.


SAM

We understand but, Ashley, do you remember anything at all?


[ASHLEY starts to have flashbacks of running through the forest. Someone is chasing after her. She looks at the ORDERLY next to her before she looks at SAM.]


ASHLEY

I can’t.


SAM

Uh sir, do you mind if I ask you a few questions in the hall?


ORDERLY

Sure.


[SAM and the ORDERLY leave the room. DEAN moves around ASHLEY’s bed.]

DEAN

Whatever you saw… we’ll believe you.


[ASHLEY breaths heavily as she cries. DEAN sits down on the bed.]

DEAN

Ashley, listen to me. Whatever you’re about to say, I want you know that we’ve heard worse. We heard weirder.


ASHLEY

It was man… who killed my friends.


DEAN

Okay.


ASHLEY

But… it wasn’t a man. He had – he had claws. And fangs.


EXTERIOR – FOREST – NIGHT

[ASHLEY is pushed against a tree. She breathes heavily as a man walks up to her, with fangs.]

INTERIOR – HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY

DEAN

Werewolf. Claws, fangs, it was a werewolf.


ASHLEY

No. No, there’s no such thing. I-I-I I must’ve been hallucinating.


DEAN

You weren’t.


[ASHLEY starts to cry again. DEAN takes her hand in his.]

DEAN

Werewolves. Monsters… they’re all real. And me and my brother, we hunt them, and we kill them. That’s what we do.


ASHLEY

Oh, God.


DEAN

Hey. Whatever you’re worried about, whatever comes at you, we will handle it. I promise you that. Now, this thing… did you get a good look at it?


EXTERIOR – FOREST – NIGHT

[ASHLEY cries as the werewolf, ANDY, presses a hand to her mouth. His claw scratches down her left cheek.]

ANDY

You saw what we did to your friends, right?


[ASHLEY nods with tears in her eyes.]

ANDY

Tell anyone about this… you’ll get worse.


[He growls in her face and she flinches back. He runs away.]

INTERIOR – HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY

ASHLEY

If I tell you, you have to protect me.


DEAN

I promise you I will.


INTERIOR – HOSPITAL HALLWAY – DAY


SAM

So, she was responsible?


ORDERLY

Not at all. But you know what? She’ll be fine, just a minor concussion.


SAM

Great. Thank you for your time.


[The ORDERLY walks away. DEAN walks over to SAM.]

SAM

So?


DEAN

Andy May.


SAM

What?


DEAN

That’s the guy, that attacked Ashley. And he’s a werewolf.

SAM

Wait a second. The night Ashley was attacked there wasn’t a full moon.


DEAN

Maybe a pureblood.


SAM

Alright. I’ll find an address.


[DEAN nods. He turns back and watches ASHLEY. She continues to cry.]

ACT TWO
EXTERIOR – FOREST – DAY

[The Impala pulls up outside a cabin in the forest. SAM and DEAN get out of the car.]


SAM

Alright. So, Andy lives here with his brother, Josh.


DEAN

He a wolf too?


SAM

One way to find out.


EXTERIOR – ANDY AND JOSH’S CABIN – DAY

[The door opens.]

DEAN

Hi, there.


JOSH

Yeah?


DEAN

Agents Ford and Hamill. Fish and Wildlife.


[JOSH looks at DEAN’s badge.]

JOSH

That’s you?


[DEAN looks at the badge. He looks at SAM before putting his badge away.]

SAM

Are you Andy?


JOSH

No. Andy!


[ANDY comes to the door.]

DEAN

Hi, there. You mind if we have a moment of your time?


JOSH

Can we say no?


[DEAN and SAM look at JOSH. ANDY laughs.]

ANDY

He’s joking. We just don’t have a lot of visitors.


JOSH

Because we don’t want visitors.


SAM

Right. Well, we’ll be quick. Tell me… have you seen this woman?


[SAM holds up his phone with a picture of ASHLEY on it.]

ANDY

Uh… never seen her.


JOSH

What does that have to do with Fish and Wildlife?


DEAN

She was attacked three nights ago, near here. Her friends were killed.


SAM

She managed to get away.


JOSH

Papers said it was a mountain lion.


SAM

Yeah, right, that’s one of a few working theories.


ANDY

Well, sometimes we go out in the woods at night. Maybe we could help. What exactly did you need?


DEAN

You go out in the woods at night a lot?


JOSH

We set rabbit traps at night. Haven’t seen anything bigger than raccoon for years.


SAM

Alright, then. We’ll get out of your hair. Just do me a favor. Do you mind writing down your phone numbers so we can reach you for a follow-up?


[SAM holds out his pad and pen. JOSH doesn’t take it.]

JOSH

We don’t have a phone. If you need us, we’ll be here.

[JOSH shuts the door.]

DEAN

Well, I say we just shoot ‘em right now. You know?


[DEAN phone buzzes. He picks it up.]

DEAN

Ashley? No, no, no. We’ll be right there.


[DEAN walks away, as SAM hurries behind him.]

INTERIOR – ANDY AND JOSH’S HOUSE – DAY

[JOSH watches from the window as SAM and DEAN get into the Impala and drive away.]

JOSH

We go out in the woods at night? Maybe we can help?


[He turns back to ANDY.]

ANDY

I didn’t know what to say. I wouldn’t have to say anything if you didn’t kill those girls.


JOSH

But I did. And you said you got the other one, you said you ate her heart, but – but no! You let her live!


ANDY

I made her promise not to tell!


JOSH

Oh, good. That worked out great.


ANDY

I didn’t want to hunt people in the first place. Dad would never have –


JOSH

Dad is dead!


[JOSH walks over to ANDY and puts his hands on his shoulders.]


JOSH

Look, hey. If you don’t want to hunt people… we’ll stop.


ANDY

You’re lying.


JOSH

I don’t lie to you. I look out for you. So, we’ll stop. But first… that Ashley girl? She’s gotta go. Alright?


[ANDY nods. JOSH nods and taps ANDY’s cheek.]

INTERIOR – MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

[DEAN switches on the light as ASHLEY walks into the room, followed by him and SAM.]


ASHLEY

I’m sorry. I… I didn’t have anyone else to call. I just couldn’t be alone.


DEAN

No, that’s uh… that’s alright. Listen, why don’t you take our room, and uh…


SAM

We’ll just grab one of the rooms next door.


DEAN

There you go.


ASHLEY

Thank you.


[ASHLEY sits down on the bed and opens her suitcase.]

DEAN

And then we’ll circle back and take down the lumberjack twins. Right? Sam? Right?


SAM

Yeah. Right. It’s just… this case, I-I mean it’s just feels weird. I mean we roll into town, there’s an eyewitness, we find them immediately… doesn’t seem a little too easy?


DEAN

Easy’s good. I like easy.


[DEAN turns back to ASHLEY.]

DEAN

Okay, um… you gonna be alright?


ASHLEY

Yeah. Thanks. Actually, could you… stay with me? Just until I fall asleep?


DEAN

Sure. Yeah.


EXTERIOR – MOTEL – NIGHT

[ANDY and JOSH sit in their car and watch from outside.]

JOSH

You sure?


ANDY

She’s here. I can smell her. But so are those guys who came out to the cabin. That’s their car.


JOSH

Don’t worry. We’ll do it quick and quiet.


INTERIOR – MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

[DEAN walks out of the bathroom.]

DEAN

Just splashed water on my face. Try to wake up. How are you doing?


[ASHLEY is sitting on one bed against the headboard.]

ASHLEY

Good. I’m tired. Those um… those pills the hospital gave me really work.


[DEAN walks over to the nightstand and picks up the bottle.]

DEAN

Oh yeah. Yeah, this is the good stuff.


ASHLEY

Do you like your job?


DEAN

What do you mean?


ASHLEY

I mean… monsters.


DEAN

Right.


[DEAN sits on the other bed and faces her.]

DEAN

Do I like it? I do. I mean, there’s bad, don’t get me wrong. A lot of bad. Still, feels good to help people. You know?


ASHLEY

Did you ever want to be anything else?


DEAN

Jimi Hendrix.


[ASHLEY laughs.]

DEAN

No, not really. I’m where I’m supposed to be.


ASHLEY

That’s nice.


DEAN

Hm.


ASHLEY

I just graduated college; we all did. My friends. We were celebrating, actually. We’ve gone camping together every year since we were little girls. Now I don’t even have them. I just moved back here and I have no idea what I’m going to do with my life.


DEAN

You got plenty of time.


[ASHLEY smiles at him. She leans her head back against the headboard.]

ASHLEY

It’s all just so random. And awful. Wouldn’t it be great if everything was just planned out for you? If it was all just… already decided?


DEAN

No, not really.


INTERIOR – MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

[DEAN is sleeping. SAM shakes him.]

SAM

Dean. Hey, Dean!


[DEAN wakes up. He looks at ASHLEY’s bed and sees she’s not there.]

DEAN

Where is she?


SAM

I don’t know. She was with you.


DEAN

What?


SAM

Dean, I just went out for food. I got back, the door was open, she was gone and you – you were sleeping.


[DEAN gets up and grabs his jacket.]

SAM

Dude, what the hell?


DEAN

Come on!


[He rushes out the door and SAM follows.]

INTERIROR – PREP ROOM – NIGHT

[ASHLEY is tied to a chair and gagged. There is a blood on the walls of the room, with knives and other equipment on the table.]

ANDY

Can we just talk about this for two seconds –


JOSH

We have a plan!


ANDY

I know, I just… I don’t like who we are now, Josh. This isn’t who we are.


JOSH

This is exactly who we are.
[He looks at ASHLEY.]

JOSH

And I wanna eat her heart.


EXTERIOR – FOREST – NIGHT

[The Impala pulls up outside ANDY and JOSH’s cabin. DEAN and SAM get out of the car.]

DEAN

Yeah, look, I get why we’re here, but there is no way that those dumbasses took Ashley without me waking up. No way.


INTERIOR – PREP ROOM – NIGHT

[JOSH walks over to ASHLEY. She panics as he comes closer. He picks up an axe from the bloody table. She screams.]

EXTERIOR – FOREST – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN hear ASHLEY scream. They run towards the cabin and take out their guns.]

INTERIOR – CABIN – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN burst through the door with their guns aimed.]

INTERIOR – PREP ROOM – NIGHT

[ANDY and JOSH hear the front door. JOSH drops the axe as he and ANDY run out of the room.]

[ASHLEY breaths heavily as she looks around the room. SAM and DEAN walk through the room with their guns aimed. DEAN walks over to her and puts his gun back in his jeans. He starts to open the gag around her mouth.]


DEAN

Okay, alright, okay.


ASHLEY

Thank you.


DEAN

Where are they? Where are they?


ASHLEY

I – I don’t know. They ran.


DEAN

Okay, let’s go. Come on.

[DEAN helps her up from the chair and walks her out behind SAM.]

SAM

Come on, come on.


INTERIOR – CABIN – NIGHT

[DEAN walks ASHLEY towards the door. JOSH comes up behind them and pushes DEAN against the wall. ASHLEY moves towards the book-shelf on the other side of the room. ANDY grabs SAM and throws him back, both of them fall over a chair and onto the ground. JOSH smacks DEAN’s gun out of his hand and starts to choke him, his fangs baring.]


JOSH

Hunters. I bet you even had silver bullets in that gun.


DEAN

Well, you win that bet.


[SAM repeatedly punches ANDY. DEAN slams his fist against JOSH’s hands and headbutts him. He reaches up and grabs the deer antlers trophy from above him. He hits JOSH with it, but it breaks. ANDY and SAM continue to fight. DEAN grabs JOSH and slams him into the coffee table. JOSH rolls them over and grabs DEAN, his fangs still baring.]

[ANDY growls at SAM and picks up SAM’s gun. He aims it at SAM as he puts his hands up in surrender. JOSH picks DEAN up as he growls in his face, and slams DEAN against another wall. ANDY looks at JOSH.]


ANDY

Josh!


[JOSH doesn’t hear him and continues to growl at DEAN. ANDY keeps looking between SAM and JOSH. A gunshot is heard. ASHLEY screams. JOSH’s fangs ascend as he lets go of DEAN. He falls to the floor. ANDY is holding the gun as he looks down at JOSH’s body. SAM gets up from the floor as ANDY points the gun at him.]


SAM

Woah, woah. Andy, no. You don’t have to do this. Alright? You don’t wanna do this.


[ANDY points the gun at DEAN.]


ANDY

He… he was my brother and he promised. But he was never going to stop. And he turned into a monster. And I’m a monster too.


[ANDY points the gun into his stomach and shoots. He falls to the floor. SAM, DEAN and ASHLEY look on in shock.]


SAM

You good?


DEAN

Yeah. Yeah, that was… that was weird.


[ASHLEY steps away from the book-shelf and DEAN takes her arm.]

DEAN

Hey, you okay?


[ASHLEY flinches away from him.]


ASHLEY

Don’t touch me!


[She loses her balance and falls back; the deer antlers piercing through her.]

DEAN

Woah!


[The boys look on in shock.]

DEAN

What?


[SAM shakes his head.]

ASHLEY

Well, this is a bitch.


[ASHLEY gets up, the antlers still stuck in her body. SAM and DEAN are confused.]

ASHLEY

And I was doing so well, too.


[She bends her back. The deer antlers fall out of her.]

SAM

What are you?


ASHLEY

Aww, Sam. You don’t remember little ol’ me?


[ASHLEY’s pupils turn up, her eyes completely white. Flashbacks to 4.22 Lucifer Rising of Sam killing Lilith with his powers.]

[ASHLEY now LILITH, looks at DEAN. Her eyes go back to normal.]

DEAN

Lilith?

ACT THREE
SAM

No. You’re dead.


LILITH Was dead. Yeah. In the Empty, sleeping the big sleep, until the boss brought me back.


SAM

The boss? Lucifer?


LILITH

God. I was supposed to get rescued and in a moment of sweet relief seduce Dean, blah blah blah, obviously that’s not happening now, so – oh, well.


SAM

So, Chuck sent you to kill us?


LILITH

No. I wish. That’s not how this story goes.


DEAN

Story?


LILITH

Oh, come on. You know how he is. All this? Personally, I thought the whole thing was kinda… easy. Stupid. But I batted my eyes and put Dean to sleep. Made sure you guys saw those two mutts go all murder-suicide. So, yeah.


SAM

Right. If you’re not here to kill us then what do you want?


LILITH

The magic gun. The one he gave you.


DEAN

The Equalizer?


LILITH

I’m not calling it that. Just give me the gun and we’ll be done.


DEAN

If God wants his little toy back, he can come get it himself.


LILITH

Oh, okay. We’re gonna do this the hard way. I love the hard way.


[SAM takes out the demon blade from his pocket.]

LILITH

Demon blade.


[DEAN takes out an angel blade from the side of his jeans.]

LILITH

Angel blade. You upgraded.


DEAN

Lady, you have no idea.


[They move towards her but LILITH blasts them away with her power. They fall back on the ground. SAM is knocked out. LILITH moves towards him as DEAN gets up.]


DEAN

Wait, wait, wait. No. Don’t touch him. Fine. You want the gun, I’ll show you where it is.


LILITH

Oh. You would promise a girl the moon, wouldn’t you, Dean Winchester? I should’ve spent more time with you the last go-around. But what if you’re lying?


DEAN

Then you can kill me.


LILITH

Except, like I said, I can’t. Still, a girl has needs. So… if this is just some desperate attempt to save poor Sam, by the time I’m through with you, you’ll be begging to die. So, are you sure?


DEAN

Yeah, I am.


LILITH

Deal.

ACT FOUR
INTERIOR – CABIN – NIGHT

[SAM is lying on the floor, still unconscious.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER WAR ROOM – NIGHT

[DEAN punches SAM across the face, repeatedly. He throws him against the railing which breaks, causing SAM to fall onto the map table and then onto the ground. DEAN jumps down and rolls up his sleeves, the Mark of Cain is on his right arm. He grabs SAM by the shirt and slams him on the map table. He punches him across the face before throwing him to the ground.]

SAM

Dean. Stop. Stop. This isn’t you.


[DEAN walks closer to SAM he stands up him from the ground. DEAN grabs SAM by the throat and pushes him up against the controls on the wall. He holds up the First Blade.]


SAM

No. No, no, no.


[DEAN’s eyes flash back. He stabs SAM with the blade. SAM’s eyes flutter closed. DEAN pulls out the blade as SAM falls to the floor.]

INTERIOR – CABIN – NIGHT

[SAM wakes up. He looks around the room. LILITH and DEAN are gone.]

INTERIOR – IMPALA – NIGHT


[LILITH faces DEAN as he drives.]


DEAN

Why? Just… why?


LILITH

Well, because, of the three potential vessels, Ashley had the best hair.


DEAN

No, why are you doing this? You even said it yourself, this is stupid.


LILITH

It is. Do you think I want to be here? I died to free Lucifer from the Cage. I had to die for what I wanted most. Then you two went and screwed it all up.

DEAN

Yeah, but that was God, too, right? Just another one of his stories?


LILITH

Well, I can’t hurt him. But I can hurt you.


INTERIOR – CABIN – NIGHT

[SAM picks up the demon blade and rushes out the door.]

EXTERIOR – FOREST – NIGHT

[SAM looks around. He sees ANDY and JOSH’s truck parked there.]

INTERIOR – IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN

I don’t get it. Why the games?


LILITH

What? You didn’t like the part when you bonded with the victim?


[LILITH pretends to be ASHLEY.]


LILITH

Wouldn’t it be great if everything was just planned out for you?


[She laughs.]


DEAN

Let me guess, one of Chuck’s lines?


LILITH

Word for word. God… he is not exactly Shakespeare. He’s more of a low-rent Dean Koontz. I had to listen to his whole, quote “writing philosophy”. And his very weird, very pervy obsession with you. Then it always ends the same. One brother killing the other. I mean, this world… he could’ve ended it in so many ways, and… he likes that one. You know, I guess that’s why you had to see the werewolf brothers die the way they did, ‘cause… foreshadowing.


INTERIOR – MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

[DEAN walks into the room, followed by LILITH.]


LILITH

So… here we are. Now, be a good boy and show me that big gun, huh?

DEAN

You know what? It’s on me. I forgot; we didn’t actually bring it. Sorry.


[LILITH flicks her finger through the air. With her powers, she slices DEAN’s left cheek.]


LILITH

Have you ever heard of Ling Chi? It’s Chinese. It means “lingering death.” Death by a thousand cuts.

[She does the same to DEAN’s right cheek. Blood drips down his face.]


LILITH

Where is the gun?


DEAN

Go to Hell.


[LILITH laughs. She flicks her hand again, causing DEAN to double over as it cuts his body.]


LILITH

I can make this last for a really long time, Dean. I can make it last almost forever.

[She uses her powers to cut DEAN again.]


LILITH

Tell me!


[SAM opens the door and comes into the motel room. He aims his gun at LILITH and shoots, the bullet hitting her in the forehead. She tries to move, but she can’t.]


LILITH

What?


SAM

Devil’s Trap bullet. We upgraded. Dean, you good?


DEAN

Nothing that a box of Band-Aids can’t fix.


SAM

Where’s Chuck?


LILITH

Why would I ever tell you anything?


SAM

Because I’ve killed you before… [he takes out the demon blade.] and I can do it again.


LILITH

See, you keep saying that, but you killed me because I let you. Now I’m feeling… less generous.

[LILITH’s eyes flash white. The room starts to shake as lights start breaking and falling.]

DEAN

Let’s move!

[The boys rush out the door. LILITH uses her powers to remove the bullet from her forehead.]

EXTERIOR – MOTEL – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN run towards the car.]


SAM

Wait!


DEAN

That shot ain’t gonna hold her forever, man. We gotta get –

[They stop in their tracks.]


SAM

Dean, I can’t move.


DEAN

Oh, crap.


[LILITH stands in front of them.]


LILITH

Sucks, doesn’t it?


DEAN

You’re never getting that gun.


LILITH

Sure I am. See, you boys left that room so fast you had no time to grab anything. So, the gun was never there. Would you really take something like that home? I mean, what if you need it? Hmm? So, it’s not in the room. And it’s not in the Bunker…


[LILITH looks back at the Impala. She walks over to the car.]


SAM

No, no, no.


DEAN

Come on.


[LILITH looks around inside the car. She opens the glove compartment and laughs. She takes out the gun and as she turns back to SAM and DEAN. She walks back over to them.]

LILITH

Well, this was fun.


SAM

You know what? Go ahead and take it. We’ll get it back.


LILITH

Will you?


[The gun lays in her hand as it starts to glow. It melts away from her hand and falls into a puddle on the ground.]


LILITH

Thank you, boys. See you soon.


[LILITH disappears. The boys step forward. They look down at the melted gun.]

ACT FIVE
INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[SAM is on the phone as DEAN walks in. He hands him a glass of whiskey.]


DEAN

That Cas?


SAM

Yeah, straight to voicemail. Again.


DEAN

Yeah, well. We gave the heads up on Chuck and Lilith, so… what else are we supposed to do?


[DEAN sits down at the table with his glass of whiskey.]


DEAN

He was supposed to be gone. God was supposed to be gone.


SAM

Yeah.


DEAN

So, what? We’re just stuck in his… in his maze, still? And now, Lilith is back. I mean, what’s he gonna do? Just throw our greatest hits at us?


SAM

I mean… why doesn’t he just kill us, already?


DEAN

Because that’s not what he wants. Lilith said that… Chuck only likes one kind of ending. You kill me or I kill you.


SAM

What?


DEAN

Yeah. Well, that’s not happening.


SAM

Dean, my dreams, or visions, or whatever… they all end the same way. With us killing each other.


DEAN

You’re just telling me this now?


SAM

I-I thought they must’ve been some form of messed up PTSD, but… but what if they’re not? What if I’m somehow seeing Chuck’s endings? You know, different ones.


DEAN

How would that be possible?


[SAM puts to his shoulder where the bullet wound is.]

SAM

‘Cause of this. When I shot Chuck, the bullet wasn’t a bullet, it was uh… a piece of me. Right? So, what if it created a – a link of sort, you know? I mean, what if – what if I don’t… what if somehow, I’m in his head?


DEAN

This was supposed to be over. We were done. We were free. And now… what are we supposed to do, man? We just keep running in this – this… friggin’ hamster wheel until we die? Or until we get boring and he ends us?


SAM

Or we fight.


[DEAN laughs bitterly.]

DEAN

Fight God?


[SAM nods.]


DEAN

Without the gun? It’s God, Sam. And he’s coming for us. How the hell are we supposed to fight God?

[SAM looks at DEAN. He picks up his drink and turns away.]
