DEAN
Rise and shine, Sammy!

DEAN is sitting on the other bed, tying his shoes. He is bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

SAM
Dude. Asia?

DEAN
Come on. You love this song and you know it.

SAM
Yeah, and if I ever hear it again I'm gonna kill myself.

DEAN turns up the volume.

DEAN
What? Sorry, couldn't hear you. (SAM laughs)

RADIO

DEAN starts bopping along. SAM shakes his head in amusement.

INT. BATHROOM

DEAN gargles loudly and long. SAM tries to ignore him long enough to brush his teeth. DEAN grins.

INT. HOTEL ROOM

SAM
Whenever you're ready, Dean.

DEAN pulls out a black bra.

DEAN
This yours?

SAM glares. DEAN laughs, rummages in the bag some more, and pulls out a gun.

DEAN
Bingo.

DEAN goes past SAM to the door.

DEAN
Now who's ready for some breakfast?


INT. DINER - DAY

The door chimes as SAM and DEAN enter. CASHIER gives MR. PICKETT some change.

CASHIER
Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett.

MR. PICKETT
Yeah, yeah.

COOK in background
Order up.

SAM and DEAN find a booth.

WAITRESS
Can't stay unless you order something, Cal. You know the rules.

CAL passes her some change.

CAL
Some coffee.

DEAN notices a poster on the wall.

DEAN
Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.

SAM
You even know what that is?

WAITRESS, whose nametag says DORIS
You boys ready?

DEAN
Yes. I'll have the special, side of bacon and a coffee.

SAM
Make it two coffees and a short stack.

DORIS
You got it.

DEAN
I'm telling you, Sam, this job is small fry. We should be spending our time hunting down Bela.

SAM
Okay, sure, let's get right on that. Where is she again?

DEAN
Shut up.

SAM
Look. Believe me, I want to find her as bad as you do. In the meantime, we have this.

SAM pulls out some papers.

DEAN
All right, so this professor.

The headline on the newspaper clipping reads "MISSING - DEXTER HASSELBACK LAST SEEN IN BROWARD, FLORIDA".

SAM
Dexter Hasselback was passing through town last week when he vanished.

DEAN
Last known location?

SAM
His daughter says he was on his way to visit the Broward County Mystery Spot.

DEAN turns over a flyer. The front has a large question mark and the words "Broward County Mystery Spot". The back says "E=MC2?", "A=πR2?", and "F=GM1M2/R22?" below the lines DEAN reads aloud.

DEAN
Where the laws of physics have no meaning.

SAM shrugs. DORIS arrives with a tray with two coffees and a bottle of hot sauce.

DORIS
Two coffees, black, and some hot sauce for the—

DORIS gasps as the hot sauce falls off the tray and smashes on the floor.

DORIS
Whoops. Crap! Sorry. (She turns to the back.) Cleanup!


EXT. STREET - DAY
A dog barks as SAM and DEAN pass. DEAN grabs the Mystery Spot flyer from SAM's hands.

DEAN
Sam, joints like this are only tourist traps, right? I mean, you know, balls rolling uphill, furniture nailed to the ceiling, they're only dangerous to your wallet.

SAM
Okay, look, I'm just saying, there are spots in the world where holes open up and swallow people. The Bermuda Triangle, uh, the Oregon Vortex—

DEAN
Broward County Mystery Spot?

SAM
Well sometimes these places are legit.

DEAN
All right, so if it is legit, and that's a big-ass if, what's the lore?

SAM
Well—

DEAN collides with BLONDE GIRL, who is carrying a stack of paper.

BLONDE GIRL
Excuse me.

SAM
The lore's pretty frigging nuts, actually. They say these places the magnetic fields are so strong that they can bend spacetime, sending victims no one knows where.

DEAN
Sounds a little X-Files to me.

SAM and DEAN pass two MOVERS trying to get a desk in a door.

MOVER 1
Told you it wouldn't fit.

MOVER 2
What do you want, a Pulitzer?

SAM
All right, look, I'm not saying this is really happening, but if it is, we gotta check it out, see if we can do something.

DEAN
All right, all right, we'll go tonight after they close, get ourselves a nice long look.


INT. MYSTERY SPOT - NIGHT
The hallway is neon green with a black double spiral painted on the walls and door. The door opens to reveal SAM and DEAN with flashlights. SAM closes the door behind them. They move up the hallway. SAM pulls out the EMF reader. DEAN shines the flashlight around and up onto a table, lamp, and ashtray attached upside-down to the ceiling.

DEAN (sarcastically)
Wow. Uncanny.

SAM examines another table with a wine glass and a poultry dinner, this one at an angle to the floor. They both move on.

DEAN
Find anything?

SAM, holding the unresponsive EMF meter
No.

DEAN
You have any idea what you're looking for?

SAM
Uh ... yeah.

DEAN raises his eyebrows skeptically.

SAM
No.

DEAN shakes his head. They both shine flashlights around other parts of the room.

OWNER
What the hell are you doing here?

SAM turns to look. DEAN points his flashlight and handgun at the voice. The OWNER has a gun aimed at DEAN. DEAN points his gun elsewhere.

DEAN
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Whoa. We can explain.

The OWNER points the gun at SAM.

OWNER
You robbing me?

SAM
Look, nobody's robbing you, calm down.

The OWNER points the gun back at DEAN.
Don't move!

DEAN
Just putting the gun down.

The OWNER fires. DEAN falls.

SAM
Dean!

SAM rushes to DEAN. DEAN struggles to breathe.

SAM
Hey!

SAM looks at the OWNER.

SAM
Call 911!

OWNER
I—I didn't mean to—

SAM
Now!

The OWNER leaves.

SAM
Hey, hey, oh, no, no, no ... not like this...

DEAN goes still. His eyes close. SAM watches, devastated.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN

DEAN turns the volume up and starts bopping along, exactly like the first time. SAM stares after him.



INT. BATHROOM

DEAN gargles loudly and annoying. SAM drinks some water, swishes, and spits. DEAN notices SAM's lack of reaction and spits out his mouthful.

DEAN
What?

SAM
I don't know.

DEAN
You all right?

SAM
I think I—

SAM pauses.

SAM
Man, I had a weird dream.

DEAN
Yeah? Clowns or midgets?



INT. DINER - DAY

The door chimes as SAM and DEAN enter. CASHIER gives MR. PICKETT some change.

CASHIER
Drive safely now, Mr. Pickett.

MR. PICKETT
Yeah, yeah.

SAM and DEAN find a booth. SAM is staring around, bewildered.

WAITRESS
Can't stay unless you order something, Cal. You know the rules.

CAL passes her some change. In the background, SAM stares hard at them.

CAL
Coffee.

DEAN notices a poster on the wall.

DEAN
Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.

SAM glances between DEAN and the poster.

SAM
It's Tuesday?

DEAN
Yeah.

DORIS
Are you boys ready?

DEAN
Yes, I'll have the special, side of bacon and a coffee.

SAM stares for a minute.

SAM
Uh, nothing for me, thanks.

DORIS
Let me know if you change your mind.

DEAN
I'm telling you, Sam, this job is small fry. We should be spending our time hunting down Bela.

SAM stares after DORIS.

DEAN
Hey.

DEAN snaps his fingers at SAM.

DEAN
You with me?

SAM
What?

DEAN
You sure you feel okay?

SAM sighs.

SAM
You don't—you don't remember? Any of this?

DEAN
Remember what?

SAM
This. Today. Like it's—like it's ... happened before?

DEAN
You mean like déjà vu?

SAM
No, I mean like, like it's really happened before.

DEAN
Yeah. Like déjà vu.

SAM
No, forget about déjà vu. I'm asking you if it feels like, like we're living yesterday all over again.

DEAN
Okay, how is that not dé—

SAM, angry
Don't, don't say it! Just don't even...

DORIS arrives with a tray with one coffee and the hot sauce.

DORIS
Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—oops! Crap!

SAM notices the hot sauce wobble on the tray and catches it as it falls. DORIS gasps. SAM stares at the bottle in his hand and gives it back.

DORIS
Thanks.

DORIS puts down the bottle and leaves.

DEAN
Nice reflexes.

SAM swallows, frustrated and confused, and doesn't say anything.



EXT. STREET - DAY
The dog barks as SAM and DEAN pass. SAM stares back over his shoulder.

DEAN
Sam, I'm sorry, but I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

SAM
Okay, look. Yesterday was Tuesday, right? But today is Tuesday too.

DEAN
Yeah. No. Good. You're totally balanced.

SAM
So you don't believe me?!

DEAN laughs and collides with BLONDE GIRL.

BLONDE GIRL
Excuse me.

DEAN
Look, I'm just saying that it's crazy, you know, I mean, even for us crazy. Dingo ate my baby crazy. Hey, maybe it was another of your psychic premonitions.

SAM
No, no way, way too vivid. Okay, look, we were at the Mystery Spot, and then—

DEAN
And then what?

SAM
(pauses, not wanting to say)
Then I woke up.

SAM and DEAN pass the MOVERS.

MOVER 1
Told you it wouldn't fit.

MOVER 2
What do you want, a Pulitzer?

SAM
Wait a minute! The Mystery Spot. You think maybe it—

DEAN
Maybe what?

SAM (sighs)
We gotta check that place out. Look, just – go with me on this, okay?

DEAN
All right, all right, we'll go tonight, after close, get ourselves a nice long look.

SAM realizes what DEAN said and whips around.

SAM
Wait, what? No.

DEAN
Why not?

SAM
Uhh (not wanting to say) – Let's just go now. Right now. Business hours, nice and crowded.

DEAN
My God, you're a freak.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN
Okay! Whatever. We'll go now.

DEAN walks a few feet ahead of SAM and looks to his right as he enters the street. A car slams into him from his left.

SAM
Dean!

SAM rushes to DEAN.

SAM
Dean, no, no, no.

DEAN has blood on his face and is barely moving. SAM turns him over and picks him up.

SAM
Come on! Dean.

MR. PICKETT leans out of the now-stopped car. SAM stares at him, then back at DEAN.

SAM
Hey. Dean.

DEAN isn't moving.

SAM
Dean. Dean.

Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.

Okay, would you listen to me, Dean? 'Cause I am flipping out.

DORIS
Are you boys ready?

SAM
He'll take the special, side of bacon, coffee, black. Nothing for me, thanks.

DORIS
You got it.

DEAN
Sammy, I get all tingly when you take control like that.

SAM
Quit screwing around, Dean.

DEAN
Okay. Okay. I'm listening. So, so – you think that you're in some kind of a what again?

SAM

DEAN

SAM
Yes, exactly. Like "Groundhog Day".

DEAN, nodding
Uh-huh.

SAM
So you don't believe me.

DEAN (laughs)
It's just a little crazy, I mean even for us crazy, you know, like, uh—

SAM
Dingo ate my baby crazy?

DEAN
How'd you know I was going to say that?

SAM
Because you said it before, Dean, that's my whole point.

DORIS
Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—whoops! Crap.

SAM catches the hot sauce and hands it back to DORIS without looking.

DORIS
Thanks.

DORIS puts down the hot sauce and leaves.

DEAN
Nice reflexes.

SAM
No. I knew it was going to happen.

DEAN (sighs)
Okay, look. I'm sure that there's some sort of an explanation—

SAM
You're just going to have to go with me on this, Dean, you just have to, you owe me that much!

DEAN
Calm down–

SAM
Don't tell me to calm down! I can't calm down. I can't. Because—

DEAN
Because what?

SAM
Because you die, today, Dean.

DEAN
I'm not gonna die. Not today.

SAM
Twice now I've watched you die, and I can't— I won't do it again, okay? You're just going to have to believe me. Please.

DEAN
All right. I still think you're nuts, but okay, whatever this is, we'll figure it out.

SAM nods unhappily.

DEAN
And you think this cheesy-ass tourist trap has something to do with it?

SAM
Maybe it's the real deal, you know? The, the magnetic fields bending spacetime or whatever.

DEAN
I don't know, it all seems a little too "X-Files" for me.

SAM
Well, I don't know how else to explain it, Dean!

DEAN
All right! All right. We'll go tonight after they close, get ourselves a nice long look.

SAM
No no no no no, we can't.

DEAN
Why not?

SAM
Because y–y–ou— (he stops, unable to finish)

DEAN
I what?

SAM doesn't say anything.

DEAN
I die there?

SAM
Blown away, actually.

DEAN
Huh. Okay, let's go now.

DEAN starts forward. SAM rushes after him and grabs him before he runs into the street. MR. PICKETT's car zooms past.

MR. PICKETT
Stay out of the way!

SAM and DEAN stare after the car. DEAN laughs until he sees SAM's face.

DEAN
Wait, did he –?

SAM
Yesterday. Yeah.

DEAN
And?

SAM
And what?

DEAN
Did it look cool, like in the movies?

SAM (irritated)
You peed yourself.

DEAN (uncomfortable, embarrassed)
Of course I peed myself. Man gets hit by a car, you think he has full control over his bladder? Come on!

DEAN is careful to look both ways before they cross the street.



INT. MYSTERY SPOT - DAY

OWNER
Boys, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. We could use all the good ink we can get.

SAM
How long have you owned the place, Mr. Carpiak?

OWNER
Well, my family's been guarding the secrets here since you don't want to know when.

SAM
So you'd know if anything strange happened.

OWNER
Strange? Strange happens here all the time. It's a Mystery Spot. (chuckles)

SAM
What exactly does that mean?

OWNER
Well, uh ... it's where the laws of physics have no meaning.

SAM, angry
Okay, like how?

OWNER, grinning
Take the tour.

DEAN
The guy who went missing, Dexter Hasselback, he take the tour?

OWNER
Uh, uh, hold on a minute, what kind of article is this?

SAM
Just answer the question.

OWNER
The police scoured every inch of this place. They couldn't find that man. I never seen him before. We're a family establishment—

SAM gets in the OWNER's face.

SAM
Listen to me. There is something weird going on here. Now do you know anything about it or not?

OWNER
Okay. Look. Guys. Um. Give me a break. I bought the joint at a foreclosure auction last March, all right? Hell, I used to sell bail bonds.

SAM stares at him, stony-faced.

DEAN
Okay, Kojak, let's get some air.

DEAN steers SAM outside.




EXT. STREET - NIGHT

DEAN
Well, I hate to say it, but that place is exactly what I thought - it's full of crap.

SAM
Then what is it, Dean, what the hell is happening to us?

DEAN
I don't know. All right, let me just – So, every day I die.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
And that's when you wake up again, right?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
So let's just make sure I don't die. If I make it to tomorrow, then maybe the loop stops and we can figure all this out.

SAM
You think?

DEAN
It's worth a shot. I say we grab some takeout and head back to the motel, lay low until midnight.

SAM nods, hopeful, anxious, shaky.

DEAN
All right, good. Who wants Chinese?

DEAN starts walking again and gets two steps before being flattened by a falling desk. The MOVERS, one holding the other end of the snapped rope and the other up in the window, stare at the scene, and SAM, despairing, also looks at his brother.

Well, first I thought it was the Mystery Spot. Now I'm not so sure.

Well, we keep you breathing. Try to make it to tomorrow. I mean, that's the only thing I can think of.

DEAN
Shouldn't be too hard.

Yeah, right. Dean, I've watched you die a few times now and I can't ever seem to stop it.

DEAN
Well, nothing's set in stone. You say I order the same thing every day, right?

SAM
Yeah. Pig in a poke, side of bacon.

DEAN turns to DORIS, who is standing by the window to the kitchen, talking with the COOK.

DEAN
'Scuse me, sweetheart?

DORIS turns.

DEAN
Can I get sausage instead of bacon?

DORIS
Sure thing, hon.

DEAN
See? Different day already. You see, if you and I decide that I am not gonna die – I'm not gonna die.

DORIS brings over DEAN's food.

DEAN
Thank you.

DEAN (reassuringly to OWNER)
Everybody's fine, nobody's gonna get hurt, okay? Sammy?

SAM stops and turns.

DEAN
Maybe you should drop the axe and let this guy go, what do you say?

SAM
Something's gotta be going on here. I intend to find out what.

SAM goes back to swinging the axe.

DEAN
Hey. Tuesday. Pig in a poke.

SAM puts a set of keys on the table. DEAN looks at them, then at SAM.

What are those?

The old man's. Trust me, you don't want him behind the wheel.

Uh, yes, we are. I'll have the special, side of bacon and a coffee.

Hey, Doris? What I'd like is for you to log in some more hours at the archery range. You're a terrible shot.

DORIS arrives with the coffee and hot sauce.

DORIS
Coffee, black, and some hot sauce for the—whoops! Crap!

SAM catches the hot sauce and slides it across the table.

DORIS
Thanks.

DEAN

SAM
I knew it was going to happen, Dean. I know everything that's gonna happen.

Okay, enough!

SAM
That's not all. Randy the cashier? He's skimming from the register. Judge Myers? At night he puts on a furry bunny outfit.

JUDGE MYERS, overhearing, knocks over his glass.

SAM
Over there, that's Cal. He's gonna rob Tony the mechanic on the way home.

DEAN
What's your point?

SAM
My point is I've lived through every possible Tuesday. I've watched you die every possible way. I have ripped apart the Mystery Spot, burnt it down, tried everything I know to save your life, and I can't. No matter what I do, you die. And then I wake up. And then it's Tuesday again.

Dog.

MR. PICKETT
Where's my dang keys?

DEAN collides with BLONDE GIRL.

BLONDE GIRL
Excuse me.

DEAN
She's kinda cute. (chuckles)

DEAN puts out a hand to stop SAM.

DEAN
Hey. All the times we've walked down this street, I ever do this?

DEAN goes back to BLONDE GIRL.

DEAN offscreen
Excuse me, miss!

SAM, staring after him
No.

BLONDE GIRL gives DEAN one of her papers. For the first time we can see that there is a picture and the word "MISSING".

DEAN
A hundred Tuesdays and you never bothered to check what she was holding in her hands?

SAM shrugs. DEAN holds up the flyer.

DEAN
That's the guy who went missing?

SAM stares at the name "DEXTER HASSELBACK" under the picture from the newspaper clipping.

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
That's his daughter back there.

SAM grabs the flyer and runs after BLONDE GIRL.

SAM
Ma'am? Ah, Miss?

The dog growls and barks at DEAN.

DEAN looks at the dog, then smiles and leans over to pet it.
Hey buddy! Somebody need a friend? Good boy—aaah!

SAM's eyes open.

INT. DINER - DAY

DEAN is eating and SAM is on the laptop; behind them the MAN with the pancakes is reading a newspaper. A thing of pink syrup is visible next to his plate.

SAM
So the police report says Dexter Hasselback is a professor, but that's not all he is.

DEAN
What is he?

SAM
I talked to his daughter. Guy's quite the journalist. Columns in magazines, a blog.

The MAN leaves.

SAM
He writes about tourist attractions. Mystery spots, UFO crash sites—he gets his kicks debunking them. I mean, he's already put four of these places out of business. Here.

SAM turns the laptop to face DEAN. Onscreen is the biography of the author of the blog "The Hasselback Report" with a picture of Hasselback and a headline DEAN reads aloud.

DEAN
Dexter Hasselback, truth warrior? More like a pompous schmuck, you ask me.

SAM
Yeah, tell me about it. I mean, I've read everything the guy's ever written, and he must have weighed a ton, he was so full of himself.

DEAN
When'd you have time to do all this research?

SAM
Come on.

SAM packs up the laptop. They get up. DEAN laughs.

SAM
What?

DEAN
I just, it's just funny, you know, I mean, this guy spends his whole life crapping on Mystery Spots and then he vanishes into one. It's kinda poetic, you know, just desserts.

SAM
You're right, that is just desserts.

SAM notices the MAN's abandoned plate; it has a partial pancake and pink syrup.

DEAN
What's wrong?

SAM watches the MAN walk by the diner windows.

SAM
Guy has maple syrup for the last hundred Tuesdays, all of a sudden he's having strawberry?

DEAN
It's a free country. Man can't choose his own syrup, huh? What have we become?

SAM
Not in this diner. Not today. Nothing in this place ever changes. Ever. Except me.

I know who you are. Or should I say, what.

MAN
Oh my god, please don't kill me.

DEAN
Uh, Sam?

SAM
It took me a hell of a long time but I got it.

MAN
What?

SAM
It's your MO that gave you away. Going after pompous jerks, giving them their just desserts—your kind loves that, don't they?

MAN
Yeah, sure, okay.

The MAN glances nervously at the stake.

MAN
Just put the stake down!

DEAN
Sam, maybe you should—

SAM
No! There's only one creature powerful enough to do what you're doing. Making reality out of nothing, sticking people in time loops—in fact you'd pretty much have to be a god. You'd have to be a Trickster.

MAN
Mister, my name is Ed Coleman, my wife's name is Amelia, I got two kids, for crying out loud I sell ad space—

SAM
Don't lie to me! I know what you are! We've killed one of your kind before!

The MAN morphs into the TRICKSTER we remember from 2.15 Tall Tales and grins. SAM and DEAN stare.

TRICKSTER
Actually, bucko, you didn't.

ACT THREE


Continuation of the previous scene.

SAM
Why are you doing this?

TRICKSTER
You're joking, right? You chuckleheads tried to kill me last time. Why wouldn't I do this?

DEAN
And Hasselback, what about him?

TRICKSTER
That putz? He said he didn't believe in wormholes, so I dropped him in one.

The TRICKSTER laughs.

TRICKSTER
Then you guys showed up. I made you the second you hit town.

SAM
So this is fun for you? Killing Dean over and over again?

TRICKSTER
One, yes. It is fun. And two? This is so not about killing Dean. This joke is on you, Sam. Watching your brother die, every day? Forever?

SAM
You son of a bitch.

TRICKSTER
How long will it take you to realize? You can't save your brother. No matter what.

SAM
Oh yeah? I kill you, this all ends now.

TRICKSTER
Oh-oh, hey, whoa! Okay. Look. I was just playing around. You can't take a joke, fine. You're out of it. Tomorrow, you'll wake up and it'll be Wednesday. I swear.

SAM
You're lying.

TRICKSTER
If I am, you know where to find me. Having pancakes at the diner.

SAM looks at DEAN, then back at the TRICKSTER.

SAM
No. Easier to just kill you.

TRICKSTER
Sorry, kiddo. Can't have that.

The TRICKSTER snaps his fingers.

Closeup of SAM's closed eyes.

RADIO
Promise me I'll be back in time

SAM's eyes snap open.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM sits up in bed and stares around.

RADIO
Gotta get back in time

DEAN
What, you gonna sleep all day?

DEAN is standing by the bathroom sink.

SAM
No Asia.

DEAN
Yeah, I know. This station sucks.

RADIO
On a roll of the dice

SAM stares at the clock radio. It says WED. SAM gasps.

SAM
It's Wednesday!

DEAN
Yeah, usually comes after Tuesday. Turn that thing off, will you?

SAM, grinning
What, are you kidding me? This isn't the most beautiful song you've ever heard?

DEAN
No. How many Tuesdays did you have?

SAM throws a long-sleeved shirt over his T-shirt.

SAM
I don't know. I lost count. Hey, wait. What do you remember?

DEAN
I remember you were pretty whacked out of it yesterday and then I remember running into the Trickster. But no, that's about it.

SAM
All right. Pack your stuff, let's get the hell out of town. Now.

DEAN
No breakfast?

SAM
No breakfast.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

DEAN pulls a shotgun out of the secret compartment, puts it in a duffel bag, closes the compartment, puts the bag in the trunk, and closes the trunk. He hears someone behind him.

DEAN
You sure we should just let the Trickster go?

DEAN turns to face the person; it's CAL, not SAM. CAL is pointing a handgun at DEAN.

CAL
Gimme your wallet.

DEAN
Whoa whoa whoa, buddy, just relax.

CAL
I am relaxed!

CAL is not relaxed.

DEAN
Okay, all right, nobody wants this to end the wrong way, let's talk about it a sec.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM is packing. His head snaps around when he hears a gunshot.

SAM
Dean!

EXT. STREET - DAY

CAL runs around the corner. SAM hurries down the motel exterior stairs. DEAN is on his side on the asphalt, blood on his shirt. SAM runs to him.

SAM
No, no, no no no, hey, hey, come on, not today, not today, this isn't supposed to happen today, come on—

SAM realizes DEAN isn't moving. He closes his eyes and waits. Nothing happens. He opens his eyes. DEAN is still dead.

SAM
I'm supposed to wake up.

ACT FOUR


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

A car, probably the Impala, drives across the screen. The caption at the bottom reads "Six Months Later".

INT. CAR - NIGHT

SAM is at the wheel. Throughout this montage, he barely has any expression. The sound of a phone ringing.

V.O. SAM
It's Sam. Leave me a message.

Beep. While BOBBY speaks, flashes of Sam shining a flashlight around, the outside of a building, Sam firing a gun.

V.O. BOBBY
Sam? It's Bobby. Heard about that demon thing you took care of in Death Valley. Nice job. Been about three months we talked, though. Be nice to hear your voice. Give a call. I'm here.

Beep.

EXT. MOTEL LOT - NIGHT

SAM opens the car trunk and pulls a gun out of the secret compartment. All the weapons are neatly placed into precisely-shaped foam slots like JOHN's arsenal in 1.20 Dead Man's Blood.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

SAM opens the room door. He pulls off his overshirt; his T-shirt is bloodsoaked. He cuts up through the bloodstain to reveal a bleeding wound. He pours hydrogen peroxide on it and goes into the hole with a pair of something resembling tweezers, with which he pulls out a bullet. He stitches the wound.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

SAM is eating.

Beep.

V.O. BOBBY
Sam? Bobby again. Look, I'm worried about you.

SAM cleans a gun, facing a wall of maps and newspaper clippings and security-camera stills featuring the Trickster, arranged in neat lines with none overlapping.

V.O. BOBBY
Just tell me you're not sitting alone somewhere obsessing over this damn Trickster. Call me, Sam. We can find it together. No one man should take something like this on alone. You hear me? By the way, that vampire nest in Austin, hell of a job.

Closeup of SAM's eyes. He sits up stiffly and makes the bed with military precision. He goes into the bathroom and brushes his teeth.

Beep.

V.O. BOBBY
Sam? It's Bobby. I found him.

INT. MYSTERY SPOT - NIGHT

BOBBY is kneeling on the floor turning the pages of a book, which is dead center of a chalked diagram with three candles and three bowls of unidentified substances. SAM enters the room behind him. BOBBY stands.

BOBBY
It's good to see you, boy.

He hugs SAM, who doesn't respond. BOBBY pulls back.

SAM
What are we doing here, Bobby?

BOBBY
Well, it's the last place we're sure the Trickster worked his magic.

SAM
So?

BOBBY
So you want this thing? I found a summoning ritual to bring the Trickster here.

SAM
What do we need?

BOBBY
Blood.

SAM
How much blood?

BOBBY
Ritual says near a gallon. And it's gotta be fresh, too.

SAM
Meaning we have to bleed a person dry.

BOBBY
And it's gotta be tonight. Or not for another fifty years.

SAM
Then let's go get some.

SAM turns to leave. BOBBY doesn't move. SAM notices and turns back.

BOBBY
You break my heart, kid.

SAM
What?

BOBBY
I'm not gonna let you murder an innocent man.

SAM
Then why'd you bring me here?

BOBBY
Why? Because it was the only way you'd see me! Because I'm trying to knock some sense into you! Because I thought you'd back down from killing a man!

SAM
Well, you thought wrong. Leave the stuff, I'll do it myself.

BOBBY
I told you, I'm not gonna let you kill a man.

SAM, shouting
It's none of your damn business what I do!

BOBBY
You want your brother back so bad?

BOBBY leans down and pulls a knife out of his bag. He holds it up to SAM.

BOBBY
Fine.

SAM eyes the knife.

SAM
What are you talking about?

BOBBY
Better me than a civilian.

BOBBY holds the knife out to SAM.

SAM
You're crazy, Bobby. I'm not killing you.

BOBBY
Oh, now I'm the crazy one. Look, Sam, I'm old, I'm coming near the end of my trail. But you can keep fighting. Saving folk. But you need your brother. Let me get him back to you.

SAM
Bobby—

BOBBY
You and Dean, you boys are the closest thing I have to family. I wanna do this.

SAM takes the knife.

SAM
Okay.

BOBBY
Good.

BOBBY turns around and goes to his knees.

BOBBY
Just make it quick.

SAM waits.

BOBBY
Do it, son.

SAM
Yeah, okay, Bobby.

SAM pulls a stake out of his shirt.

SAM
But you wanna know why?

SAM grabs BOBBY around the throat and shoves the stake through his back. The tip comes out BOBBY's chest.

SAM
Because you're not Bobby.

SAM twists the stake. Blood spurts out of the wound.

BOBBY goes still and falls forward. SAM lets go of him, then stares at BOBBY's corpse. Nothing happens.

SAM
Bobby? Bobby! Bobby!

BOBBY's corpse vanishes. The stake falls over, then shoots over SAM's shoulder into the hand of the TRICKSTER. SAM turns to face him.

TRICKSTER
You're right. I was just screwing with you. Pretty good, though, Sam. Smart. Let me tell you, whoever said Dean was the dysfunctional one has never seen you with a sharp object in your hands. Holy Full Metal Jacket.

SAM
Bring him back.

TRICKSTER
Who, Dean? Didn't my girl send you flowers? Dean's dead. He ain't coming back. His soul's downstairs doing the hellfire rumba as we speak.

SAM
Just take us back to that Tuesday—er, Wednesday—when it all started. Please. We won't come after you, I swear.

TRICKSTER
You swear.

SAM
Yes.

TRICKSTER
I don't know. Even if I could—

SAM
You can.

TRICKSTER
True. But that don't mean I should. Sam, there's a lesson here that I've been trying to drill into that freakish Cro-Magnon skull of yours.

SAM
Lesson? What lesson?

TRICKSTER
This obsession to save Dean? The way you two keep sacrificing yourselves for each other? Nothing good comes out of it. Just blood and pain. Dean's your weakness. And the bad guys know it, too. It's gonna be the death of you, Sam. Sometimes you just gotta let people go.

SAM
He's my brother.

TRICKSTER
Yup. And like it or not, this is what life's gonna be like without him.

SAM
Please. Just—please.

TRICKSTER
I swear, it's like talking to a brick wall. Okay, look. This all stopped being fun months ago. You're Travis Bickle in a skirt, pal. I'm over it.

SAM
Meaning what?

TRICKSTER
Meaning that's for me to know and you to find out.

The TRICKSTER snaps his fingers.

Closeup of SAM's closed eyes.

RADIO
Promise me I'll be back in time

SAM's eyes snap open.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM sits up in bed and stares around.

RADIO
Gotta get back in time

DEAN
What, you gonna sleep all day?

DEAN is standing by the bathroom sink brushing his teeth.

DEAN
I know, no Asia. This station sucks.

RADIO
On a roll of the dice

SAM checks the clock radio. It says WED.

SAM
It's Wednesday.

DEAN
Yeah, usually comes after Tuesday. Turn that thing off.

SAM throws off the covers and goes to pull DEAN into a hug.

DEAN
Dude, how many Tuesdays did you have?

SAM
Enough. What, uh, what do you remember?

DEAN
I remember you were pretty whacked out of it yesterday. I remember getting up with the Trickster. That's about it.

SAM nods.

SAM
Let's go.

DEAN
No breakfast?

SAM
No breakfast.

DEAN
All right, I'll pack the car.

SAM
Wait, you're not going anywhere alone.

DEAN
It's the parking lot, Sam.

SAM
Just—just trust me.

SAM, dressed, zips closed a bag. DEAN opens the door, then turns back.

DEAN
Hey, you don't look so good. Something else happen?

SAM says nothing for a moment.

SAM
I just had a really weird dream.

DEAN nods.

DEAN
Clowns or midgets?

SAM looks up. DEAN grins. SAM tries to smile. He picks up his bag. DEAN leaves. SAM follows, stopping at the door to look back at the unmade bed. SAM turns off the light and closes the door.
