TEASER
MADISON, WISCONSIN
[INT. BAILEY’S HOUSE – NIGHT]
[WES BAILEY opens the door, gets home. He moves to the kitchen and turns the light on. Suddenly, he hears a voice belonging to his wife, ERICA BAILEY.]
ERICA
Hi.
[WES is surprised, but not shocked.]
WES
No.
[ERICA nods.]
WES
How? You’re… dead.
ERICA
I was. But… (she gets closer to Wes) aren’t you gonna say hi back?
WES
Hi.
ERICA
I missed you, Baby Bear.
[ERICA leans in to kiss her husband. Instead, she STABS him. WES falls to the ground with a thud, dead, blood pouring everywhere. ERICA leaves the house.]

==ACT ONE==
LEBANON, KANSAS
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER – MORNING]
[SAM enters the bunker with breakfast.]
SAM
Hey. How you feelin’?
[DEAN is working on his laptop. He looks up at SAM, but doesn’t reply.]
SAM
What you, uh, working on?
DEAN
Dead guy in Madison. Police say it was a home invasion, but neighbor claims that she saw the Vic’s dead wife leave the crime scene.
SAM
(coming down the stairs)
Let’s check it out.
DEAN
What, you ready to ditch Damien? What do you wanna do? Leave him in a ring of holy oil with some Netflix and a frozen pizza?
SAM
(sarcastic) Ha. No. Actually… I thought we’d, uh, bring him along.
DEAN
(scoffs)
Uh, hell, no. What, “Adventures in Babysitting” the Antichrist? No, thank you.
SAM
Dean, we can’t hide him forever. And, you know, just keeping him cooped up here isn’t working.
DEAN
Yeah, it is, actually. You wanna know why? Because as long as he’s here, he’s not out there doing God knows what. So what, does this mean that your plan for bringing Mom back isn’t working? ‘Cause I’ll say it again—Mom’s dead, Sam. Lucifer ripped out her freakin’ heart. Now, the sooner you can wrap your head around that, the sooner we can all move on.
SAM
So you’re saying you want to move on, from Mom?
[They stare at each other.]
DEAN
Right now, I wanna kill some dead guy’s dead wife.
SAM
Dean, that isn’t what this is about. Jack needs to get out. He needs to get some air. We all do. He’s a good kid. He is, just… give him a chance, please. For me.
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER – LATER]
[SAM knocks on JACK’s door.]
SAM
Jack?
(He opens the door)
Hey.
[JACK is watching “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” on his computer.]
SAM
“Clone Wars”?
JACK
The computer said I’d like it. I do like Ahsoka. Kinda hate Anakin.
SAM
Uh… that’s probably for the best. Never mind. Um, hey. You remember when I told you what Dean and I do? Our, uh, our day job?
JACK
You kill monsters because you’re the good guys.
SAM
Right, right. And we’ve got a case, so… thought you might want to come along.
JACK
No.
SAM
Jack, I really think this would be good for you. You know, maybe a change of scenery might—
JACK
Get my powers working again?
SAM
Yeah, maybe.
[JACK pauses the video.]
JACK
So I can be your “interdimensional can opener”?
[SAM sighs deeply.]
JACK
You’re using me.
SAM
(Sighs) Jack… when you were born, it ripped a hole in reality. Like a—like a door from this world to another, to a… a really bad, bad place. So—so Dean and Cas, and I, we—we closed that door. But… our Mom, Mary, she’s trapped on the other side.
[JACK looks at SAM.]
SAM
If we can get your powers back, maybe we can open that door up. Maybe…
JACK
You wanna save her.
SAM
Yeah. Yeah, I do. But… if this doesn’t work, if that can’t happen, that’s okay, because I do care about you. But I should’ve told you. I’m sorry. It’s a lot and, uh…
JACK
Dean can’t even look at me. He wants to kill me.
SAM
I won’t let that happen. Listen, if there’s one thing that Dean respects, it’s effort. So come along. Help us out. Let’s go be the good guys.
[JACK smiles.]
MADISON, WISCONSIN
[EXT. BAILEY’S HOUSE – DAY]
[Establishing shot of the house. DEAN, SAM and JACK park outside the house.]
[INT. IMPALA – CONTINUOUS]
[JACK is looking at DEAN and SAM’s fake FBI badges.]
JACK
Agent Bonham, Agent Seger, Special Agent Anderson—these are you?
SAM
Yeah, sometimes.
JACK
I thought lying was wrong.
DEAN
All right, here we go. Victim, Wes Bailey. His wife, Erica, died six months ago. Heart thing, out of the blue. Uh, question is, why’d she come back from the dead and knife his ass?
JACK
People come back?
SAM
When a person dies and their soul can’t move on…
DEAN
They’re called ghosts. And hanging around makes them go loony tunes. Uh, they go crazy.
SAM
Yeah, question is, since when do ghosts kill somebody and walk out the front door?
DEAN
So maybe it’s a revenant.
JACK
Wait. What’s a revenant?
SAM
A revenant’s more like a—a zombie.
DEAN
Hey, there’s our witness.
[The Baileys’ neighbor is watering her plants.]
SAM
Jack, we’re gonna talk to the witness, check out the crime scene.
[SAM and DEAN get out of the car. DEAN leans into the car window, where JACK is sitting.]
DEAN
You stay. Sit.
[On the NEIGHBOR, watering the plants.]
SAM
Now, you’re sure it was his wife?
BAILEY’S NEIGHBOR
I’ve lived next to Erica for six years. I watered her plants every time she and Wes took a vacation.
[JACK is staring intently at them from the car.]
SAM
What about that night? You notice anything else? Maybe, uh, flickering lights, cold spots?
BAILEY’S NEIGHBOR
I… I think a street light did flicker. M—Maybe.
[DEAN notices that JACK is gone.]
DEAN
We got a runner.
SAM
(To the woman) Thank you.
[They head toward Bailey’s house.]
[INT. BAILEY’S HOUSE – KITCHEN – DAY]
[JACK kneels beside the pool of blood left by Wes Bailey.]
DEAN
Hey! I told you to wait in the car. What the hell are you doing?
[JACK stands up, startled.]
JACK
I’m trying to help out.
DEAN
How is this helping out?
SAM
Hey, Dean. Thank you, Jack. Did you find anything?
JACK
Just this.
[He points at the pool of blood.]
DEAN
Oh.
SAM
All right. Jack, look. This is an EMF meter. (He shows Jack) Okay, so spirits, ghosts, they put out electromagnetic interference. If one’s here, this will tell us.
[SAM turns the EMF meter on. It doesn’t detect any ghost activity.]
JACK
What’s it saying?
DEAN
It’s saying it’s a revenant.
[SAM turns off the EMF meter.]
DEAN
We gotta check her grave.
SAM
(to Jack) Come on.
[FADE to: a shot of the MOON.]
[EXT. CEMETERY – NIGHT]
[The boys are in front of ERICA BAILEY’s grave, ready to dig.]
DEAN
All right, well, you said you wanted to help, so, uh… (he throws his shovel at Jack) dig.
SAM
Dean, what’s up with all the orders? You’re starting to sound like Dad.
DEAN
That a bad thing?
SAM
I’m just saying his—his drill sergeant act worked with you… but it didn’t work with me. And that’s not the way we’re gonna get through to Jack.
DEAN
Look, you wanted the kid here, he’s here. All right? But I’m not gonna hold his hand and tuck him in at night. Pass. I’m not gonna be his mother, and neither are you. And the kid can dig, so I’ll give him that.
[We see that JACK is almost done digging. When he opens the coffin, the corpse of ERICA is inside.]
DEAN
All right, I guess we’re back to ghost.
SAM
Yeah. So, a body rules out revenant. All right, I don’t get it. I mean, a ghost that won’t show up on EMF? Doesn’t make any sense.
DEAN
Yeah, well, what does these days?
[DEAN gets ready to salt and burn the body.]
You know, I mean, we—we’ve got portals to apocalyptic worlds. We’ve got, uh, shape-shifting demons. Dealing with a new whole set of tiddlywinks. I say we just… do what we do.
JACK
My mother… could she be a ghost?
SAM
No, we, um… we burned the body.
DEAN
That’s right, and what gets burned… stays dead.
[DEAN sets the body on fire. The boys look on as it burns.]
[FADE to: THE EMPTY]
[CASTIEL is walking around, surrounded by complete darkness.]
CASTIEL
Hello? Hello! Hello?! Hello!
==ACT TWO==
[EXT. ROAD – NIGHT]
[A CAR is slowing down. It stops; the car door opens. GLORIA SIMON peeks out, looks at the tires.]
MAN ON PHONE
Roadside assistance. May I help you?
GLORIA
I blew a tire, out on Route 19.
MAN ON PHONE
Okay, no problem. We’ll get someone right out there.
[GLORIA sits back in her car. She sees a CHILD in the rear-view mirror. When she turns, the child is sitting in the backseat.]
GLORIA
Scotty?
[SCOTTY nods.]
GLORIA
Oh, baby!
[SCOTTY kills her.]
[FADE to: the CRIME SCENE, the morning after.]
[SAM and DEAN are already there as FBI agents.]
DEAN
Well? Get anything?
SAM
Yeah, cops found the victim, Gloria Simon, about an hour ago. Something ripped her apart.
DEAN
Our kind of something?
SAM
No. Gloria was on the phone with roadside assistance when she died. Operator said she was talking to someone named Scotty.
DEAN
And?
SAM
According to the cops, Scotty is her son. Uh, was her son. He drowned in ’96.
[DEAN checks the EMF meter. It doesn’t detect any ghost activity.]
DEAN
So we got two ghosts in two days, and… no EMF.
SAM
So?
DEAN
So, aside from getting dead, what do Gloria and Wes have in common?
[INT. THE EMPTY]
[CASTIEL is still wandering through the EMPTY. A mysterious black, viscous humanoid form raises from the dark.]
[EXT. MADISON POLICE DEPARTMENT – NIGHT]
[SAM is leaving the police department with some documents.]
SAM
Where’s Jack?
DEAN
Across the street. Food run.
[JACK is waiting in line to get food at a hot dog kiosk across the street.]
SAM
Dean, he’s not our intern. I asked you to keep an eye on him
DEAN
I can see him. He keeps staring at me.
SAM
Yes, he wants you to like him. All right, whatever. Here, take a look.
[SAM hands DEAN a journal.]
DEAN
What’s this, her diary?
SAM
It’s a grief journal. Cops found one at the first crime scene also. Wes and Gloria were both seeing the same grief counselor—Mia Vallens—and apparently, she gives homework.
DEAN
Hmm. Shrinks. Snake oil for the mind.
SAM
Or how healthy people deal.
DEAN
Yeah? All right, let’s see how good old, uh, Gloria was dealing. Here you go. “And now that I’ve achieved catharsis, I can truly see the program works.” The program? Come on, I mean, she’s one Kool-Aid away from Jonestown. What’d Wes’ “journal” say?
SAM
More of the same. Um, he really was into the whole catharsis thing.
DEAN
Yeah, sure. Who wouldn’t be? I mean, it’s like another word for “happy ending”.
[JACK is back.]
SAM
Hi, Jack.
DEAN
What took you so long?
JACK
The man in front of me wanted extra kraut, but the hot dog man didn’t have any. He was really angry.
[DEAN starts eating his hot dog.]
DEAN
Mmm. That’s a cool story. So let’s say that Hannibal chick is, um, a medium, right? She’s talkin’ to spirits, she’s pissing them off somehow. A ghost shows up, notches a kill, and takes off.
SAM
Yeah, but then, what? Once it’s gone, no EMF?
JACK
This woman can talk to ghosts?
DEAN
If she’s the real deal, mediums can do all kind of freaky crap.
SAM
All right, say you’re right. Can’t go in as FBI, not with doctor/patient confidentiality.
DEAN
All right. So we have to go in as something else.
[EXT. VALLENS FAMILY THERAPY STUDIO – DAY]
[The boys arrive at MIA VALLENS’ studio.]
DEAN
This is a dumb idea.
SAM
Just follow my lead.
DEAN
Yeah, doctor’s gonna eat our liver with some fava beans and a bottle of Chianti.
[A MAN is exiting the building.]
MAN
Hello.
[JACK stops, smiles at the man.]
JACK
(cheerfully)
Hello!
[The man smiles back at him. The boys enter the building.]
[INT. VALLENS STUDIO – CONTINUOUS]
SAM
Hello?
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?
SAM
Yeah, we’re, uh… hoping to see the doctor.
RECEPTIONIST
Oh, I’m sorry. You caught us right at the end of our day. Maybe tomorrow.
DEAN
No, today’s good. Like right now.
SAM
He—Uh, we just need a moment of her time.
[MIA enters the scene.]
MIA
You’ve lost someone recently?
DEAN
No.
JACK
My mother.
SAM
Uh, our mother. We’ve having a difficult time.
[MIA rushes to shake their hands.]
MIA
Mia Vallens.
DEAN
Hi. Dean.
SAM
That’s our little brother Jack, and I’m Sam.
MIA
I see. Please, this way.
SAM
Sure.
[DEAN puts a hand on JACK’s shoulder.]
DEAN
Listen, Mr. Spock, you speak when I tell you to speak, okay?
JACK
Yes.
DEAN
Good.
[They move to MIA’s studio.]
MIA
Your mother—she passed suddenly?
SAM
Uh, yeah.
MIA
Mm. Most of the people I see are in the same boat. No warning, no goodbye, no closure.
[They all take a seat.]
SAM
Right, yeah. Pretty much the same for us. Um… So how does this usually work? You know, with your patients?
MIA
Usually, they just start talking about the person they’ve lost.
DEAN
All right, well, Mom was great, now she’s dead. What’s the deal with catharsis?
MIA
I’m sorry?
SAM
Uh, we—we were wondering what that is. Um, a patient of yours, Gloria Simon, she referred us. She’s a family friend.
MIA
I don’t talk about my patients, and Gloria wasn’t supposed to talk about me.
SAM
Sure, um… got it. But your process—
MIA
My program is a range of things. Talk therapy, meditation. You ever journal?
SAM
Our dad did.
MIA
Dean? You journal?
DEAN
Ever since I was a little girl.
MIA
You think this shrink stuff is a load of crap. Am I right?
DEAN
How’d you guess?
MIA
Then why are you here?
SAM
Because, uh, we all agreed we’d give it a shot, right?
[JACK nods.]
SAM
Right?
[DEAN smiles forcedly.]
SAM
My brother, he’s not, uh, he’s not processing his grief.
MIA
Mm.
DEAN
Really? No, I’m… (chuckles) No, I’m good, actually. With death, closure, whole freakin’ bottle of Jack.
SAM
Are you?
DEAN
Yeah. Because I know that Mom’s dead, and I know that she’s not coming back.
SAM
Okay, I hear what you’re saying, I just wish…
MIA
You wish he’d be more open to therapy?
SAM
Sure. Exactly.
DEAN
All right, this is a safe place, right, Doc? Okay. My brother’s delusional…
SAM
Dean.
DEAN
You said you wanted to give this a shot, right? Here we go. He won’t even admit that Mom’s dead. Won’t even admit it.
SAM
Stop.
DEAN
Because if he admits it, then it’s real. If it’s real, then he has to deal with it, and he can’t handle that.
SAM
Right, because this is so easy for you, uh?
DEAN
No, it’s not easy.
SAM
Yeah, but at least you had a relationship with Mom. I mean, who would she always call? Who did she look to for everything?
DEAN
Okay.
SAM
You had something with her I never had! And now I’m just supposed to accept that I never will have it?
[SAM leaves the room, slams the door behind him. Next, we see him drinking some water. He notices a sign on the stairs: PRIVATE – Please Respect Our Privacy. There’s a drop of what seems blood on it. SAM walks up the stairs. More blood on the railing. He gets into the RESTROOM. Inside the bathtub, there is a bloody mass of skin, hair and teeth.]

==ACT THREE==
[INT. VALLENS STUDIO – DAY]
[DEAN drinks from his flask. MIA scoffs.]
DEAN
Problem?
MIA
You just upset your brother so much, he had to leave the room. And Jack? Look at him. He’s terrified of you.
DEAN
Nah. No, we’re simpatico. Right, kid?
JACK
(flatly)
We’re simpatico.
MIA
Convincing. You’re angry, Dean.
DEAN
And?
MIA
And if you don’t want to do anything about it, that’s your business. But you’re aiming it at everyone in your life.
[SAM bursts into the room. He points his gun at MIA.]
SAM
She’s a shape-shifter!
MIA
No, no.
SAM
I found hair… and teeth.
[DEAN points his gun at MIA, too.]
SAM
You must’ve shed your skin, what, couple of hours ago?
DEAN
And here, I just thought she was annoying.
JACK
What’s going on?
DEAN
Doc’s a monster. She killed her patients.
MIA
No! No. No. I am what you say, but I have never killed anyone.
SAM
Then, what are you doing here?
MIA
I’m helping people. My patients.
[We see flashbacks of MIA’s patients.]
WES
I just miss her so much.
MIA
I shift into the person that they’ve lost, so that they could see them one last time, so that they can say goodbye.
[We see that MIA has shifted into ERICA. WES stares at her, shocked.]
WES
Oh my god.
DEAN
Well, Wes Bailey…
[FLASHBACK of ERICA killing WES.]
[Back to the present.]
DEAN
Gloria Simon…
[FLASHBACK of GLORIA’s son killing her.]
DEAN
They’re both dead.
MIA
What?
DEAN
Gloria was killed by her son, or at least someone who looked like him.
SAM
Three nights ago, Wes was killed by somebody who looked like his dead wife.
DEAN
So you wanna tell us how you’re innocent again?
MIA
Okay, I, um… I have an alibi for Wes. I volunteer at the women’s shelter downtown. I was there that night. You can call them. I know you guys are Hunters. But please, I am telling you the truth.
[INT. THE EMPTY]
CASTIEL
I know you’re there. I can feel you.
COSMIC ENTITY
Hello.
[The camera moves to reveal… a CASTIEL DOPPELGANGER. The COSMIC ENTITY has shifted into a perfect copy of Castiel.]
CASTIEL
What are you?
COSMIC ENTITY
Oh, I’m just your friendly neighborhood cosmic entity.
CASTIEL
Why do you look like me?
COSMIC ENTITY
Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Well, I show up in my real form, and you freak out, rip out your own eyes, et cetera. That would be embarrassing, wouldn’t it? For both of us.
CASTIEL
What is this place?
COSMIC ENTITY
Oh, yes. Excellent question. You see, before God and Amara, creation, destruction, Heaven, Hell, your precious little Earth, what was there?
CASTIEL
Nothing.
COSMIC ENTITY
Yes. That’s right. Nothing. Nothing but Empty. And you are soaking in it. Angels and demons, you all come here when you die.
CASTIEL
Every angel that ever died is here?
COSMIC ENTITY
Yes, sleeping an endless peaceful sleep. You know I… I was sleeping, too. Hey, uh, since we’re pals, there’s something I’ve gotta know. I’ve just gotta ask. Hmm. Why are you awake? ‘Cause fun fact—in all of forever, nothing ever wakes up here. I mean, ever. Ever. And second fun fact—when you woke up, I woke up, and I don’t like being awake. So…what’s up, smart guy?
CASTIEL
I don’t know.
COSMIC ENTITY
Well, think!
CASTIEL
The Winchesters. Sam and Dean, they must’ve made a deal.
COSMIC ENTITY
No. No, no, no. Not with me, and I’m—I’m the only one that has any pull here. Not Heaven, not Hell, not G-O-D himself. So think harder. (He aggressively pokes Castiel’s forehead) Rack that perky little brain of yours.
CASTIEL
Stay away from me.
COSMIC ENTITY
Okay, fine. I’ll rack it for you.
[The COSMIC ENTITY puts a hand on CASTIEL’s head. CASTIEL screams in pain.]
[INT. VALLENS STUDIO – DAY]
[DEAN walks back into the room after checking MIA’s alibi.]
DEAN
All right. Alibi checks out.
SAM
What?
DEAN
Yeah, I’m surprised, too.
SAM
Okay. Well, if you’re not doing this, who is?
MIA
Oh, God. I think I know.
[MIA moves to take a box from drawer behind her.]
SAM
Hey.
[MIA takes out a photograph of a man. She shows it to the boys.]
MIA
His name’s Buddy. When we got together, I was young and stupid. He’s a shifter, like me. The only one I’d ever met other than my mother. But he liked hurting people.
JACK
Did he hurt you?
[MIA nods.]
MIA
I left. Changed my face, my name. Buddy wouldn’t just kill people. He’d ruin their lives. He said he liked to see the look on their face when they realized they had nothing left. What I’m doing here… I know it can’t make up for what…what he… (sighs) what we did, but I’m trying.
SAM
If Buddy is doing this, he’s targeting your patients. So who else has access to this office, your notes, your appointments?
MIA
Patients and staff are in here all day.
DEAN
If you had to pick one.
MIA
Uh… Tom, my assistant.
DEAN
I’ll check it out.
JACK
I’ll come with.
DEAN
Uh…
[SAM clears his throat.]
DEAN
Fine. Whatever.
[EXT. TOM’S HOUSE – EVENING]
[DEAN and JACK arrive and park the IMPALA outside Tom’s house.]
DEAN
All right, stay in the car.
JACK
Dean, I—I just—I wanna help. Sam told me about the plan for your mother.
DEAN
Well, there’s something you should know. Sam’s plans don’t always work out. Wait here.
[INT. VALLENS STUDIO – EVENING]
[SAM is talking on the phone.]
SAM
Yeah, yeah, no. I… All right. Got it. Thanks. (He hangs up)
MIA
What?
SAM
Dean says Tom is in the clear.
MIA
How do you know?
SAM
He, uh, he handed him a silver dollar. Didn’t burn. Turns out your assistant’s just a nice guy with five cats.
MIA
What are you doing?
SAM
I’m scrubbing your security cam footage. If anyone’s eyes flare…
MIA
Then they’re the shifter.
SAM
Exacly.
MIA
Right.
SAM
So… tell me. How exactly does this work with your patients? You show up as their dead relatives, and they think what?
MIA
Honestly? They don’t really care. They chalk it up to hypnotism, a lucid dream. They explain it away because at the end of the day, they get to say goodbye.
SAM
Hmm. And that works?
MIA
Mm—hmm. People? We’re hardwired to want closure. You know? You never got a chance to say goodbye either, did you?
[SAM checks the security cam footage.]
SAM
Whoa, whoa. Check this out.
[On the screen there’s the MAN that the boys came across with while they were entering the building for the first time. SAM zooms in on his face. His eyes are flaring.]
SAM
There. Who’s that?
MIA
That’s John Driscoll. I only started seeing him a few weeks ago.
[INT. THE EMPTY]
[CASTIEL is on the floor, breathing heavily.]
CASTIEL
What did… What did you do to me?
COSMIC ENTITY
I—I read your mind, such as it is.
CASTIEL
What do you want?
COSMIC ENTITY
What do I want? I want you to shut up. I want—hmm. Having you awake, it’s like a gnat flew right up here and it’s trapped and it’s buzzing.
CASTIEL
Having me awake causes you pain.
COSMIC ENTITY
If you can’t sleep, I can’t sleep. Yeah? And I like sleep. I need sleep.
CASTIEL
Then get rid of me.
COSMIC ENTITY
Oh, I should, should I?
CASTIEL
Send me back to Earth.
COSMIC ENTITY
Or I throw you so deep into the Empty that you can’t bother me anymore, hmm?
CASTIEL
Except you know that won’t work, or you would’ve done it already.
COSMIC ENTITY
Pretty smart. Pretty smart, dummy.
CASTIEL
Send… Me… Back.
COSMIC ENTITY
That’s not part of the deal. No, no. Besides, you don’t want to go back.
CASTIEL
Yes, I do. Sam and Dean need me.
COSMIC ENTITY
Oh, save it. I have tiptoed through all your little tulips. Your memories, your little feelings, yes. I know what you hate. (Whispers) I know who you love… what you fear. There is nothing for you back there. No. Here. Let me show you.
[The entity touches CASTIEL’s head. CASTIEL screams.]
[We see some FLASHBACKS: METATRON stealing CASTIEL’s grace; LUCIFER killing CASTIEL; CASTIEL walking into the lake after the LEVIATHANS took over; CASTIEL returning the souls he stole from Purgatory; CASTIEL lying on the floor, seemingly dead, after returning the souls.]
[CASTIEL yells.]
[INT. VALLENS STUDIO – NIGHT]
[MIA opens the door. DEAN is back.]
DEAN
Hey.
MIA
Hi.
DEAN
Where’s Sam?
MIA
Buddy’s posing as one of my patients. Sam traced his phone. I let him take my car. He left about 10 minutes ago.
DEAN
He didn’t call me.
MIA
Well, can you blame him?
[DEAN grabs his phone to call Sam.]
JACK
Mia? Could I talk to you?
MIA
Yes, of course. This way.
[DEAN watches as they go into MIA’s studio.]
JACK
Sam and Dean aren’t my real brothers. Sometimes we have to lie. I’m still trying to understand.
[In the other room, DEAN is calling SAM.]
DEAN
Come on, Sam. Pick up the phone.
JACK
My mother died when I was born.
[JACK opens his laptop to show MIA the video his mother left him.]
KELLY
(on the screen)
Hi, Jack. It’s, uh… I’m your Mom.
[JACK pauses the video.]
JACK
I never met her. I… This is all I have. And I just… I need to… see her, just once. Please.
[MIA nods.]
MIA
Shut your eyes.
[In the other room, DEAN is still trying to call his brother. He hangs up. JACK keeps his eyes closed until MIA comes back.]
MIA
You can look now.
[MIA has shifted into KELLY.]
JACK
Mom?
MIA/KELLY
Hi, Jack.
[MIA rushes to hug JACK. He starts crying.]
MIA/KELLY
It’s okay. It’s okay.
JACK
I’m afraid.
MIA/KELLY
Why? Why are you afraid?
JACK
Sam thinks you were right, that—that I’m good. He wants me to believe it, and I wanna believe it, too. It’s just, I… I’ve hurt people. I didn’t mean to. It was an accident. And I know I should feel bad, and I say I feel bad, but most of the time, I mostly… I don’t feel anything. And that’s why I think maybe… Maybe I’m a monster.
MIA/KELLY
Jack. It doesn’t matter what you are. It matters what you do. And even monsters can do good in this world.
JACK
You really believe that?
MIA/KELLY
I have to. I have to.
[MIA hugs JACK again.]
[DEAN’s phone starts ringing. It’s SAM. He picks up.]
BUDDY/DEAN
Hey, what’s up?
SAM
Hey. I, uh, I was too late. Shifter’s gone. Driscoll’s dead.
BUDDY/DEAN
Damn it. All right. Well, get back here.
SAM
Yeah, on my way.
[He hangs up.]
BUDDY/DEAN
Well, that was too freakin’ easy.
[DEAN looks down. We see… the real DEAN, laying on the floor, unconscious.]
[MIA is back to her form. She hugs JACK.]
JACK
Thank you. I—Thank you.
[BUDDY, still posing as Dean, bursts into the room. When he sees JACK, he grabs a fire iron.]
JACK
Dean?
[BUDDY knocks him out. MIA gasps. Then, BUDDY starts tearing the skin on his face away. He tears off his scalp to reveal his true face, covered with blood.]
BUDDY
Hey, baby.

==ACT FOUR==
[INT. THE EMPTY]
[CASTIEL is on the floor.]
COSMIC ENTITY
Come on, Castiel! Wouldn’t you rather be a fond memory than a constant, festering disappointment?
[The entity kicks CASTIEL.]
COSMIC ENTITY
Just let’s lay down. Let’s just try and sleep. Hmm? Think about it. Infinite peace, yes? No regrets. No pain. Kiddo, save yourself.
CASTIEL
I’m already saved.
[The entity kicks him again. CASTIEL slowly stands up.]
CASTIEL
You can prance and you can preen and you can scream and yell and remind me of my failings but somehow, I’m awake. And I will stay awake and I will keep you awake until we both go insane.
[The entity punches him.]
CASTIEL
I will fight you. Fight you and fight you for…ever. For eternity.
COSMIC ENTITY
No. No.
CASTIEL
Release me. Release… me.
[INT. VALLENS STUDIO – NIGHT]
[BUDDY handcuffs DEAN to the fireplace.]
MIA
Buddy, what are you doing?
BUDDY
What am I doing?
MIA
Yeah.
BUDDY
What am I doing? What are you doing, huh?
[DEAN wakes up.]
BUDDY
You think you can just leave? Build this whole new life for yourself without me, huh?
DEAN
Kid.
BUDDY
(to Dean)
Oh, you’re up.
MIA
Wait, no, no, no, no, no! Don’t hurt them.
BUDDY
Oh, begging for Hunters? That’s not my girl.
MIA
I’m not your girl.
BUDDY
You always did think you were too good for me even though I gave you everything.
DEAN
(whispers)
Jack.
MIA
You used me!
BUDDY
Yeah, well, welcome to the world, sweetheart! Everybody uses everybody.
DEAN
(to Jack)
You gotta snap these cuffs.
BUDDY
I never stopped looking for you.
JACK
I can’t.
BUDDY
And when I found this place, when I saw all that…
DEAN
Yes, you can.
BUDDY
…warm, fuzzy good you were doing. I couldn’t let you have that.
DEAN
Sammy believes in you, and when he believes, he’ll go Hell for leather…
BUDDY
So I took it all away, and it was fun.
DEAN
…but you gotta try.
MIA
You’re… you’re a…
BUDDY
What? A monster? Well, so are you. And it’s about time you embraced that. So I’m not gonna kill those boys. You are. You end them, or you die, courtesy of Tweedledee’s silver bullets. So what’s it gonna be, princess?
[BUDDY points a gun at her.]
MIA
Shoot me. Shoot me!
[BUDDY sees on the security cam footage that SAM is back. He laughs.]
BUDDY
Look. Baby brother.
MIA
No. No!
[BUDDY points the gun at the door. MIA tries to stop him.]
MIA
Stop!
BUDDY
Like shooting Hunters in a barrel.
DEAN
Sam, no!
[BUDDY punches DEAN. SAM has entered the building.]
SAM
Dean?
BUDDY/DEAN
Sam!
[SAM grabs his gun, cautiously walks toward the door.]
BUDDY/DEAN
We’re in here!
MIA
Stop.
[SAM puts the gun away. In the other room, BUDDY gets ready to shoot him and muffles MIA’s cries.]
[SAM opens the door. BUDDY is ready to shoot.]
JACK
No!
[JACK uses his powers to stop BUDDY, who shoots anyway. JACK deviates the bullet and throws BUDDY against the wall. SAM shoots BUDDY and kills him.]

ACT FIVE
[INT. VALLENS STUDIO – NIGHT]
[MIA is kneeling beside BUDDY’s body.]
DEAN
You sure about this?
MIA
What Buddy did was my fault. I should’ve… You guys can go. I’ll take care of him. You know, I just—I just wanted to help people.
JACK
You did.
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER – KITCHEN – DAY]
[JACK is drinking a glass of water. DEAN gets in the kitchen to grab a couple bottles of beer.]
JACK
Hey.
DEAN
Hey. You did good today, Jack.
[He leaves. JACK smiles.]
[INT. MEN OF LETTERS’ BUNKER – LIBRARY – CONTINUOUS]
[DEAN hands SAM a bottle of beer.]
DEAN
Listen, man, back at, uh, Mia’s, I was out of line. I’m sorry for being a… a dick lately.
SAM
Thanks.
DEAN
And maybe you’re right, about the kid. I mean, he tries. I’ll give him that. And he tapped his powers, saved our ass, so that’s a win.
SAM
Yeah. I guess.
DEAN
What’s up?
SAM
What if you’re right? About Mom. What if she is dead, and I’m just in denial?
DEAN
Don’t say that.
SAM
What? You’ve been wanting me to admit that since it happened.
DEAN
I know I have, but don’t say that. I need you to keep the faith, for both of us. ‘Cause right now, I… Right now, I don’t believe in a damn thing.
[CUT to: EXT. A FIELD – DAY]
[CASTIEL is lying on the ground. He wakes up and slowly stands up, looks down at his body. He smiles and looks up. He closes his eyes.]
