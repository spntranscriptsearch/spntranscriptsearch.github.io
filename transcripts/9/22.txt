TEASER


[Episode opens up in a ice cream parlor in Dixon, Missouri. A few people are sitting at the counter. A lady and her young son are ordering at the register.]


LADY

Yeah... Give me one scoop of the no-fat, non-dairy vanilla, with a quarter teaspoon of the sugar-free caramel, and 10 -- not 9, not 11 -- blueberries. Got it? Good.


[The employee at the register stares at the woman in annoyance as she addresses her son.]


What do you want, honey?


BOY [looking at a girl in a booth eating a huge banana split]

That!


LADY [approaching the girl]

Excuse me. I-I know this is none of my business, but --


GIRL

You're right. It's not. Go away.


LADY

Where are your parents?


GIRL

I don't have parents. I'm an Angel.


LADY

Yeah, you're a little Angel. Does your mother know you're sitting here, eating diabetes?


[A man walks in the door looking around and as soon as the girl catches his eye she stiffens.]


GIRL [to the lady]

You need to run.


LADY

What?


GIRL [turning on the lady with her eyes flashing blue]

Now!


[The man charges the girl and then there is an outside shot of the ice cream parlor (named Colonel Scoop's) as it exploded in a flash of bright angel light. Glass shoots out into the street.]


TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
[Scene opens in SAM's room. He is dead asleep on his bed. Suddenly a hand enters the frame and blaring loud rock music plays. SAM jerks awake and pulls a gun on the intruder....who just happens to be his big brother.]


DEAN [shutting off the music]

Nice reflexes. Better hair.


SAM [still half asleep]

What's wrong with you? I could have shot you. [checks his watch] Why aren't you sleeping? We got in like two hours ago.


DEAN

Not tired. And we got work to do, so put on your dancing shoes, and let's boogie.


[Later in the main room of the bunker, SAM walks in with a cup of coffee while DEAN is busy packing his duffel on the table.]


SAM

All right. What's up?


DEAN

I called Cas. He said there's something going down in Missouri.


SAM

What kind of something?


DEAN

He said he couldn't talk about it over the phone.


SAM

Why?


DEAN

Because he is a weird guy, okay? He's a weird, dorky, little guy. But he happens to have an army of Angels behind him, and, even though I hate to say it, if we're gonna take a shot at Metatron, they might be useful.


[DEAN goes to put the First Blade into his duffel but SAM notices and you can see his level of concern growing.]


SAM

Well, do you think we need the First Blade? Why don't we just leave that here?


DEAN

We talked about this, and we decided that --


SAM

No. In all fairness, we didn't decide. You did.


DEAN

Okay, I decided that a hockey stick that can kill anything might come in handy, so sue me.


SAM

How many times have we been around this block? Magic that powerful comes at a price, and right now we don't know what that price is.


DEAN

I'm fine. I'm fan-friggin'-tastic.


SAM

And I'm glad, honestly. I'm not saying we bury the thing. I'm saying we just save it for when we really need it. Crowley. Metatron. The big boss fights. You don't have to have it with you all the time, right? I mean, just leave it. Please.


DEAN [setting the blade to the side]

No problem.


SAM

Thank you.


[Scene changes to outside the exploded Colonel Scoop's. SAM and DEAN approach a deputy on duty outside. They go to pull their badges but before they can flip them open she addresses them.]

DEPUTY

Agents Spears and Aguilera? FBI?


DEAN

Uh-huh.


DEPUTY

Your partner said you'd be along.


SAM

Thank you.


[They enter and greet CASTIEL who has been talking with the Sheriff.]


CASTIEL

Thank you for coming.


SAM

Spears and Aguilera?


CASTIEL

I've noticed your aliases are usually the names of popular musicians.


DEAN

Wow.


CASTIEL

Come here. Take a look at this.

[They approach a body on a gurney and we see her eyes are burned out of her head.]

Look. And the other bodies are the same -- burnt-out husks.


DEAN

Okay, so, what is this, some sort of mass smiting?


CASTIEL

I don't know what this was. Never seen anything like it. Six humans died here... And one angel.


SAM

One of yours?


CASTIEL nods

Was a good soldier. This attack... I knew he wanted a war, but this...This is abhorrent, even for him.


[Scene changes to METATRON standing in front of a mirror in his office trying on a trench coat. Someone knocks at the door. METATRON tries hurriedly to take the coat off.]


METATRON

Uh...just a second!


[A second later, GADREEL enters. METATRON glares at him.]


GADREEL

I gave you a second.


METATRON

You are such an...angel sometimes. What do you want?


GADREEL

To talk about tonight.


METATRON

We'll be fine.


GADREEL

No, we -- we're losing, Metatron. Castiel's followers outnumber us. And while they haven't gone on offense, they have proven capable. They stopped you from killing him, and me, for example.


METATRON

I told you, we had our shot with operation Lee Harvey, and we took it. I gave the orders. You weren't to be harmed.


GADREEL

You had me followed.


METATRON

Yeah, and you met with the enemy... In secret. What is that old line about sins and stones?


GADREEL

He spoke. He lied. And I listened. That's it. But I serve heaven. I serve you.


METATRON

Good. Don't forget it. I mean, I-I don't get this whole Cas lovefest, either. I'm offering our people a way home, and still -- still, they're choosing him over me. I mean, sure, he's cute. And Castiel has this simple...charm. He's like a mentally deficient puppy. But I'm lovable. And funny. I made God laugh -- twice!


GADREEL

You're the one who asked him to lead an army.


METATRON

Well, I didn't think he'd be good at it.


GADREEL

Your meeting tonight -- Tyrus -- he controls the largest independent faction of angels left, and --


METATRON

And I have to make a good impression. I know. I've got a plan.


GADREEL [motioning to the trench coat]

It's not that, is it?


METATRON

Shut up!


[CASTIEL, SAM and DEAN enter CASTIEL's command center. The place is bustling with angels. HANNAH rises to greet them.]


HANNAH

Commander.


DEAN [mutters]

Oh, it's just creepy.


CASTIEL

Sam, Dean, this is Hannah.


HANNAH

The Winchesters -- I've heard so much about you.


DEAN

What can I say? Cas is a fan.


[An angel in a red shirt takes a box of evidence that CASTIEL is holding]

I'll start to examine this evidence.


DEAN

Y-- oh, um...


HANNAH

Sir, this morning, Josiah wasn't at roll call.


SAM

Uh, roll call? You hold, uh, roll call?


CASTIEL

They like to hear me say their names.


DEAN

I know a couple of women like that.


HANNAH

No one's seen Josiah since Ezra was murdered. We think that --


SAM

You think Josiah's the killer, that he is the mole?


HANNAH

Well, who else? We searched the grounds, but he's vanished.


DEAN

Not without wings. He's an angel, but he's still got to travel like he's a human, which means walk, drive --

means he's gonna leave a trail.


SAM [sitting down at a computer]

All right. What was his vessel's name?


CASTIEL

Sean Flynn from Omaha.


SAM [turning the computer screen]

This the guy?


CASTIEL

Yeah, that's him.


SAM

All right. Looks like someone just used his credit card at a Gas-n-Sip in Colorado.


DEAN

And that's how we do things in the pros.


RED SHIRT ANGEL

Commander. I have something. This phone's memory chip has a video time-stamped just before the explosion.


[video plays showing footage from inside Colonel Scoops...

CUSTOMER

And now the moment you've all been waiting for.


LADY

What?


GIRL

No!


MAN rips open his coat to reveals a sigil carved into his chest. He rams an angel blade through his heart as he yells

I do this for Castiel!


The whole ice cream shop explodes. Video goes dead.]


ACT TWO
DEAN

What the hell was that?


CASTIEL

I don't know. I didn't -- I would never ask an angel to sacrifice himself to kill innocents. I'm gonna be sick.


SAM

Cas, why would an angel blow up a Colonel Scoop's in your name?


HANNAH

That's not what he was doing. Roll it back. There. [HANNAH points the girl in the booth.] That was an angel -- Esther. She's one of Metatron's.


SAM

So, this was some kind of hit?


CASTIEL

I don't know.


DEAN

Stop saying you don't know.


CASTIEL

You can't think I would allow something like this.


DEAN

Cas, I know you try to be a good guy, okay? I do. You try. But what you got here, this is a a freakin' cult.


CASTIEL

Dean.


DEAN

And the last time you had this kind of juice, you did kill humans and angels, and you did nothing but lie to me and Sam about it the whole damn time!


SAM

Can we, uh -- can we take this somewhere else, guys?


[They enter CASTIEL's private office]


SAM

Will you stow the baggage, Dean. Look, we've got a case. Let's work it. Cas, did you know the angel in that video?


CASTIEL

Yes. His name was Oren. He was a new recruit. He worked in community outreach.


DEAN

And what does that mean?


CASTIEL

Some of my troops are stationed at a local hospital. They help where they can. Minor miracles -- it's nothing that would attention.


SAM

So, what was he doing in that video, with the stabbing?


CASTIEL

The Enochian runes that were carved in his chest -- I...I think that they were meant to focus energy. When he stabbed himself, it unleashed all that power.


SAM

So, what about the girl? What happened to her?


CASTIEL

If she was the target, if the blast was focused on her, then more likely than not, she -- she was atomized. So, what do we do now?


DEAN

Well, you don't do jack. Me and Sam will head to the hospital, see if we can find somebody who knew this...walking nuke.


CASTIEL

Hold on. These are my people. I can help.


DEAN

Well, that's sort of the problem. I mean, the Manson girls aren't gonna give us a straight answer with Charlie in the room, so just hang back.


CASTIEL

So, I should just sit here?


DEAN

Pretty much.


CASTIEL

No. If you don't want my help, then I will follow Josiah's trail to Colorado. I have to do something, Dean.


DEAN

All right, fine. But Sam's coming with you.


SAM

What?


CASTIEL

Because you don't trust me?


DEAN

To help.


[SAM and CASTIEL drive down the road in CASTIEL's car]


CASTIEL

Abaddon is dead.


SAM

And then some.


CASTIEL

Oh, no.


SAM

Okay. Um...Ominous.


CASTIEL

Does Dean seem different to you?


SAM

Yeah. Lately, he seems to be...amped up --you know, on edge.


CASTIEL

Effects of the mark?


SAM

What else?


CASTIEL

He does seem angry. I mean, he's always a little angry, but now it seems like...more. I think a part of him actually believed that I ordered those angels to, you know...Sam, you don't, do you?


SAM

No, man. Cas, listen. You got a weird thing going on back there. Those other angels, the way they stare at you, I-it's like you're part rock star, part L. Ron.


CASTIEL

They've put their faith in me.


SAM

And maybe that's the problem. I mean, people have been doing messed up crap in the name of faith -- in the name of God -- since forever.


CASTIEL

Well... I'm not trying to... play God. I'm just trying to get my people home.


[Scene changes to METATRON and GADREEL watching a very large man throw a bowling bowl down a lane. He throws a strike.]


METATRON

Yes! Well done!


TYRUS

It's such a simple game. And boy, you got to love the sound of those pins.


METATRON

Beautiful -- a symphony of wood.

So, you've heard our offer.


TYRUS

Yeah, I sign on the dotted line, and, well, my people, they get a ticket upstairs. What if we don't want to go?


GADREEL

But it's home.


TYRUS

It's boring. I mean, you -- there's nothing like this in heaven.


METATRON

I could whip you up a bowling alley.


TYRUS

Eh, but it wouldn't... I mean, just smell that. Mmm.


GADREEL

Old shoes and... Alcoholism? I...


TYRUS

Authenticity.


METATRON

So, wait. You're turning me down because of...bowling?


TYRUS

And I like being an independent operator. And I hear you're losing. And I hate your face.


METATRON

Well, I could get a new face.


TYRUS

You'd still be you -- a nerd trying to be one of the popular kids. Mnh-mnh.


METATRON

Okay. Time for the hard sell.


TYRUS

Please. You knife me, and all my guys will go running to Castiel. Even you're not that stupid. But tell you what, huh? You out-bowl me, we'll talk?


[SAM and CASTIEL are at the Gas-N-Sip in Colorado talking to the store employee]


EMPLOYEE

Ma yeah, I saw him, officer. He filled up some old, uh, woody station wagon.


SAM

Don't suppose you, uh, got the license plate number?


EMPLOYEE

No. But he was headed to an address in Pray, Montana.


CASTIEL

How do you know that?


EMPLOYEE

Guy asked for directions.


SAM

Oh.


EMPLOYEE

Uh, you want me to write that down?


SAM

Yes. Now. Please.


[DEAN is questioning a female angel in a doctor's coat. They are sitting across the table from each other in a room that looks like a boiler room.]


DEAN

What do I call you?


FLAGSTAFF

My angelic name is 18 syllables long. Let's stick with Flagstaff.


DEAN

Copy. So, you knew this Oren guy?


FLAGSTAFF

We worked together at the hospital. He was a joy -- bright, full of life.


DEAN

Yeah, I hear he had a real explosive personality.


FLAGSTAFF

Do you think this is a joke?


DEAN [stone faced]

Do you see me laughing? Is there anything else you can tell me about him? For example, why he'd light his own fuse.


FLAGSTAFF

No. Can I go? I have lives to save.


DEAN

Welcome to the club.

[FLAGSTAFF smirks]

Something funny?


FLAGSTAFF

Not funny "ha ha." But you thinking you help people -- it's amusing. I help people. A clogged artery here, a tumor there. I do good in this world. You -- you believe every problem can be solved with a gun. You play the hero, but underneath the hype, you're a killer with oceans of blood on his hands. I hate men like you.


[DEAN stares at her calmly and then leaps to his feet and throws the table between them aside in one swift movement. He throws FLAGSTAFF and her chair backwards but catches them before they hit the ground and instantly has an angel blade to her throat.]


DEAN

Honey, there ain't no other men like me.


FLAGSTAFF [scared out of her mind]

Don't...please.


DEAN

Oren. Friends?


FLAGSTAFF

Constantine... And Tessa.


DEAN starts at that name

Tessa? The reaper, Tessa?


FLAGSTAFF

You know her?


[SAM and CASTIEL pull up outside a warehouse in Pray, Montana.]


SAM

That looks like the car the guy at the gas station was talking about, right? Maybe Josiah's still around.


CASTIEL

Sam, this place is... radiating power. I haven't felt anything like this since... since heaven. We have to get in here.


SAM [goes to picks the lock]

All right.


[The door will not open no matter how much SAM bangs his shoulder against it.]


CASTIEL

Step aside. I got this.

[CASTIEL throws his body into it and jangles the door handle a few times. Nothing happens.]

I don't got this.


[Outside of an auditorium, people walk up the stairs. Tessa walks up to the stairs but is stopped by DEAN's voice as he steps from behind a post.]


DEAN

Howdy, Tessa. You're supposed to be working at the hospital tonight, but when I stopped by, you were gone. So was an ambulance. Pro tip -- they all have GPS.


TESSA

Good to know. So, you're here. Why? You just love musical theater?


DEAN

Only if it's "Fiddler." We need to talk.


TESSA

Can't. Sorta got a date.


[As she turns to leave DEAN grabs her jacket to pull her back but accidently reveals part of a sigil carved into her chest. DEAN quickly puts two and two together.]


DEAN

Not happening.

[She tries to jerk away but DEAN handcuffs her and pushes her to a wall]

Where's the other one? Where's Constantine?


[Scene changes to METATRON slamming his bowling shoes on the counter in disgust.]


TYRUS

Better luck next time.


METATRON

Thanks.


CONSTANTINE

Metatron!

[he rips open his shirt and stabs an angel blade into his heart]

I do this for Castiel.


ACT THREE
[SAM and CASTIEL are still trying to get into the warehouse.]


SAM

I checked all the windows and doors. No luck. What about you? You find anything?


CASTIEL

I think so.

[He lights up his hand blue and reveals an enochian spell etched above the doorway.]

It's Enochian. I believe it's some sort of riddle. "Why is six afraid of seven?" Now, I assume it's

because seven is a prime number, and prime numbers can be intimidating.


SAM [bemused]

It's because seven eight nine.


[The door opens with a loud creak]


CASTIEL

It's wordplay. And the answer is the key, like the doors of Durin in "Lord of the Rings."


SAM

Wait a second. You know about "The Lord of the Rings?"


CASTIEL

I'm very pop-culture savvy now.


[SAM's phone rings]

Hey.


DEAN

How is he?


SAM

He's, uh...He's Cas. What about you? How's it going?


DEAN

Great. Went out, got some air. Met an old friend. Say hi to Sam, Tessa.


TESSA

Your brother's a psycho, Sam.


DEAN

Ha, ha. Stop.


SAM

What's going on?


DEAN

You first.


[In the Commander Room, FLAGSTAFF is talking to HANNAH and RED SHIRT ANGEL.]


FLAGSTAFF

I know he's the commander's friend, and I know we're supposed to pretend we like him, but that ape put a knife to my throat.


[DEAN and TESSA walk in]


HANNAH

Tessa? What are you doing?


DEAN

You want to tell her?


[TESSA remains silent so DEAN pulls back the top of her shirt to reveal the sigil which he has obviously cut a gash across to mark it out.]


HANNAH

Oh, God.


TESSA

There's no God. There's only Castiel.


DEAN

Oh, and you're done.


[DEAN walks TESSA down a hallway and puts her in a warded room. HANNAH and the others follow.]


HANNAH

You wounded her.


DEAN

More like "defused," okay? I cut up that old testament graffiti she carved into herself. I figured that would break the spell.


RED SHIRT ANGEL

And now... What will you do to her?


DEAN [pulling an angel blade from his jacket]

Guess.


FLAGSTAFF

Torture. Predictable.


DEAN

We need to know if there are other bombers out there.


HANNAH

No. I won't allow it. I know what Tessa was planning. It's horrible, but there's only one person who can punish her.


DEAN

Let me guess. Yea big, trench coat, sensible shoes?


HANNAH

You have to understand that Castiel is the only thing holding us together. A month ago, half the angels in this place were trying to kill the other half. Castiel has given us a purpose. But more than that, he has given us a way to live in peace. We have rules. Order. If I let you take matters into your own hands, what's to stop one of them from doing the same? You can talk to her. You should talk to her. But leave the Blade outside.


DEAN

Are you asking or telling?


RED SHIRT ANGEL

We're not asking.


[DEAN stares evenly at all the angel before him without blinking an eye. He smoothly flips the blade handle first and hands it to HANNAH. He then walks calmly into the room with TESSA.]


[SAM and CASTIEL are searching the warehouse.]


SAM

You sure you don't want to go back, Cas? Look, if Dean is right about Tessa...


CASTIEL

No, I, uh...I do. I just... give me a second.


SAM [noticing some writing on the wall, shines his flashlight up to it]

"Only the penitent man shall pass"? Cas, wait!


[Cas falls to his knees just in time to avoid two huge spinning saw blades which spring out from the wall about neck height.]


SAM

"The Last Crusade."


[DEAN sits across from TESSA at the table. HANNAH stands to the side.]


DEAN

Okay. Well, let's start with an easy one. Who are you working for?


TESSA

Castiel.


HANNAH

Liar.


TESSA

People like you, they never understand. Sacrifices have to be made.


DEAN

So you go after one of the bad guys, and if a few humans get microwaved, no big deal, right?


TESSA

In the grand scheme, they don't matter.


DEAN

Oh, Tessa, you are so wrong.


TESSA

When Castiel came to me and told me what I had to do, he said I was chosen because I was strong. Others...they couldn't handle this. They're too weak. [she looks at HANNAH]


[HANNAH leaps at TESSA but DEAN puts his arm up to stop her. He grabs her shoulders and shoves her out the door and into the hallway. He steps out to and closes the door behind him.]


DEAN

Settle down!


HANNAH

Is -- do you think she's telling the truth?


DEAN

She thinks she is.


[SAM and CASTIEL round a corner and there is a glowing door in front of them]


CASTIEL

Sam. We found it.


SAM

What?


CASTIEL

It's the door to heaven.


SAM

Seriously?


CASTIEL

What else would Metatron go to such great lengths to protect? I can hear it. It's calling to me, Sam. If we control this door, we can take the fight to Metatron. We may not even need to fight at all.


SAM

Cas, wait.


[CASTIEL opens the door and it is revealed to be a room with atrocious party decorations. SAM walks over to a table and reads from a card]


SAM

"Welcome to your own personal heaven, Castiel. Good luck finding the real one."


CASTIEL

But... Why?


[SAM turns around to talk to CASTIEL but starts when he sees a badly burned man leaning against the wall next to the door.]


CASTIEL [leaning down next to the man]

It's Josiah. He reeks of holy oil.


SAM [noticing an empty bucket of holy oil hung over the door]

Yeah. Looks like he got "Home Alone"-ed.


CASTIEL

So, all of this -- it was a a lie.


[JOSIAH jerks to consciousness and grabs CASTIEL's wrist.


JOSIAH

Supposed to be here...Gate... He told me... After Ezra, he told me that I should come to him. Metatron told me that I could go home. I just wanted to go home.


CASTIEL [going to heal him]

Here. Let me --


JOSIAH

No! I would rather die than owe my life to you, Castiel. You play at being noble. You play at being one of us. But I look into your eyes... And I don't see an angel staring back at me.


[JOSIAH dies]


[DEAN walks back into the room with TESSA]


TESSA

Where's your friend?


DEAN

Just you and me now. Let's talk about us. I mean, we got history, yeah?


TESSA

Sure. I still remember our meet-cute. You were dying.


DEAN

Good times. Here's the deal. I like you, Tess, okay? For an angel. But tell me, why are you doing this?


TESSA

Castiel.


DEAN

No, forget Cas. Why are you doing this? What would make a person want to pop their top, huh? I mean, look, I've been in bad shape. I have. But I have never been that damn low.


TESSA

I guess I just can't take the screaming.


DEAN

Who's screaming?


TESSA

All of them. The lost souls. The ones that can't get into heaven now that it's been boarded up. I hear them. They are so confused. They're in so much pain. All I want to do is help them. It's what I do. It's my job. But I can't. So I suffered... Until death, nothingness. Suddenly, it didn't seem so bad. It seemed quiet.


DEAN

So, why don't you just jam an angel blade in your throat and call it a day?


TESSA

I thought about it. But I was too weak. Till Castiel gave me a reason to die.


DEAN

Yeah. See, that just doesn't sound like the Cas I know.


TESSA

But doesn't it, though? And the Cas you know, would he raise an army of angels without telling you? 'Cause this Cas did. I'll tell you a secret. There's more out there...Like me. So many more.


DEAN

You got names?


TESSA

That would ruin all the fun.


DEAN

No. No, see...the fun's just getting started.


[DEAN pulls the First Blade from his jacket. TESSA starts back]


TESSA

Dean, what have you done?


DEAN

What I had to.


TESSA

Welcome to the club.

[TESSA sprints at DEAN and impales herself on the blade in DEAN's hand]

Thank you.

[She dies in a bright light]


[HANNAH and company burst into the room as DEAN feels the high from the blade kill]


ACT FOUR
[DEAN is handcuffed to a chair in the warded room. He has duct tape over his mouth and his nose is bleeding. HANNAH opens the door as CASTIEL and SAM burst in]


HANNAH

He put up a fight.


CASTIEL

Get out.


[SAM moves quickly to DEAN and rips off the duct tape]


DEAN

AH! You should have seen the other 10 guys.


CASTIEL

They said you killed Tessa?


DEAN

Not so much. She knifed herself.


SAM [removing the handcuffs]

Yeah? Why would she do that, Dean?


DEAN

I don't know, Sam. She was saying all kinds of crap.


SAM

So that's why you brought out the First Blade?


DEAN

They told you about that, huh?


SAM

We had a deal.


DEAN

Yeah, well, it was a stupid deal.


SAM

Really? 'Cause if you'd stuck to it, Tessa would still be alive. Without her, we ain't got jack.


DEAN

Yeah, you think I don't know that? You think I wanted that to happen?


SAM

I don't know, Dean. Did you?


CASTIEL

All right, that's enough. Stop it.


HANNAH [opens the door]

Commander, I'm sorry, but you have a call...From Metatron.


[CASTIEL and the brothers walk into the war room as METATRON waits patiently on video call.]


METATRON

Castiel. Bet you're not happy to see me.


DEAN

Is anyone ever?


METATRON

Dean, always with the B-grade '80s-action-movie wit.


SAM

What do you want, Metatron?


METATRON

Just to tell ass-tiel, there, that I'm still alive. His bomber failed.


CASTIEL

My bomber?


METATRON

The crazy guy. Big knife. Kablooey. I'm fine, thanks for asking, but Gadreel is wounded, and Tyrus - R.I.P. His followers are not your biggest fans, by the way. They've all come over to my team.


CASTIEL

I didn't send anyone to kill you.


METATRON

Oh, stop lying, Castiel.


CASTIEL

Who are you to lecture me on lying? Your deception led to the fall.


METATRON

I did what I had to do. I have always done what I have to do, for God and for the angels.


DEAN

Sure. Yeah, you're mother Teresa with neck beard.


METATRON

What I did was neither good nor bad. It was necessary -- a small hardship to make us all stronger, to make us a family again.


SAM

Yeah, except for the angels you had Gadreel kill.


METATRON

Okay, yes. Maybe I got a little carried away at first, but those days are over. A near-death experience makes you re-evaluate. So, one time only, I'm offering amnesty. Every angel, no matter what their sin, may join me and return to heaven. I will be their God, and they can be my heavenly host.


HANNAH

Why would we follow you?


METATRON

Well, look around. You've seen earth. You've had a taste of free will. I got to ask you -- do you like it? I mean, the way you've flocked off to follow Castiel tells me you need to follow someone. It's in your DNA. But Cas -- he's not what you think he is. He sends angels out to die. Have you told them about your stolen Grace, Castiel? How it's fading away, and when it burns out, so will you? So...No, then. I'm not the best, but I'm the best you've got. You want to stay with Castiel, fine, but he's playing you, because at the end of the day, the only thing he cares about is himself and the Hardy boys there. You've got a choice to make. Make the right one.


[METATRON clicks off]


CASTIEL [turning to the angels]

He's lying.


HANNAH

About the Grace?


CASTIEL

It's complicated.


HANNAH

So he wasn't lying.


CASTIEL

He was about everything else. He...you believe me, don't you?


HANNAH

I want to believe you, but I...we need proof.


CASTIEL

Name it.


HANNAH [pointing to DEAN]

Punish him.


DEAN

What?


HANNAH

He murdered Tessa. He broke our rules.


DEAN

Y'all can all go to hell.


[DEAN turns to leave but is stopped by angels]


CASTIEL

Dean.


SAM [goes to his brother's aid but is also subdued but angels.]

Hey, wait a sec--


HANNAH

You gave us order, Castiel, and we gave you our trust. Don't lose it over one man. [She hands a blade to CASTIEL] This is justice.


[CASTIEL takes the blade and holds it as he considers. DEAN stares at him in shock. CASTIEL struggles but then decides]


CASTIEL

No. I can't.


HANNAH

Goodbye, Castiel.


[All the angel quietly file out of the war room leaving DEAN, CASTIEL and SAM standing there alone.]


ACT FIVE
[METATRON enters his office talking on the phone. GADREEL waits in one of the chairs.]


METATRON [speaking to the person on the phone]

You're right. There is no other side. Well, welcome aboard. [hangs up]

Well... the first of Castiel's flock has come around. The rest will follow.


GADREEL

You should have told me what our elite unit was for.


METATRON

Why? It was none of your business.


GADREEL

Tessa, Constantine -- I recruited them, and you brainwashed them into blowing themselves up.


METATRON

So? Well, that's an old writer's trick -- flipping the script. You start by building up a seemingly unbeatable enemy, like the death star, or a rival angel with a bigger army. That way, I look like the underdog. But then, oh, no! The competition gets greedy. He starts pushing things too much. With the help of my combustible double agents. And then, after a rousing speech, his true weakness is revealed. He's in love with humanity.

And now...I'm inevitable.


GADREEL

What about Josiah?


METATRON

Mm. He was a loose end. I -- I told him where the gate was...Before we moved it. I just wish Cas had walked into one of those traps. Anyway, point is --while everyone else is playing checkers, I'm playing monopoly, and I always build a hotel on Boardwalk. And I always win.


[CASTIEL, DEAN and SAM enter the bunker.]


SAM

So, Dean, uh...are we gonna talk about this, or what?


DEAN

About what? Yeah, I lied, but you were being an infant.


SAM

Wow. Even for you, that apology sucked.


DEAN

Oh, I'm not apologizing. I'm telling you how it's gonna be.


SAM

Dean, that Blade --


DEAN

That Blade's the only thing that can kill Metatron, and I am the only one who can use it...so from here on out, I'm calling the shots. Capisce? Look, until I jam that Blade through that douchebag's heart, we are not a team. This is a dictatorship. Now, you don't have to like it, but that's how it's gonna be.


[SAM's angry looks propels him away while DEAN goes up the stairs and sits down across from CASTIEL]


DEAN

So, batteries...


CASTIEL

I'm fine.


DEAN

No, you're not. How long you got?


CASTIEL

Long enough to destroy Metatron, I hope. But without an army...


DEAN

Well, hey, you still got us.


CASTIEL

Dean. Those bombers -- you don't really think that I --


DEAN

Cas, you just gave up an entire army for one guy. No, there's no way that you blew those people away.


CASTIEL

You really believe we three will be enough?


DEAN

We always have been.


[SAM enters the room at the same time as GADREEL does. He shouts a warning and DEAN and CASTIEL leap to the defense.]


SAM

Guys!


GADREEL

I'm not here to fight. I thought about what you said. You're right. Metatron, he's...something needs to be done.


SAM

And we should trust you why?


GADREEL

Because I can give him to you. I know where Metatron is. I know everything. I know the bombers. They were his agents, not yours. You don't trust me, fine. I understand. I've...made mistakes. But haven't you? Haven't we all? At least give me a chance.


[DEAN and SAM exchange looks. DEAN steps forward and extends his left hand to shake GADREEL's. But as soon as the angel grasps it DEAN yanks the First Blade out of his jacket and slashes GADREEL deeply across the chest. SAM and CASTIEL leap at DEAN and hold him back as he snarls under the full power of the blade and GADREEL falls heavily to the ground.]
