NOW

Elwood, Indiana

(Night time. A truck is parked in a cornfield. Two people are smooching on a blanket in front of the truck. A shadow passes over them.)


PATRICK

Did you see that?


KIM

See what?


PATRICK

Something out there.


KIM

Patrick!


PATRICK

Something out in the corn.


KIM

(gasps) Patrick, you’re freaking me out!


PATRICK

Just having a quick look.


KIM

Patrick. Patrick. Patrick? Patrick! PATRICK! PATRICK!!


(Patrick disappears in a blaze of light)

( Pan back to crop circle)

(Roll X-Files type credits)




ACT ONE

(Daytime)


WAYNE WHITAKER (MAN ON THE STREET)

I’m here because I believe that Elwood Indiana has become a center of extraterrestrial activity.


KIM FROM CORNFIELD

There was this light. And then Patrick just vanished.


SPARROW JENNINGS

It’s all happening, you know? I mean, these entities have come to help push humanity to the next stage.


WAYNE WHITAKER

My name is Wayne Whitaker, Jr., and I have personally recorded dozens of eyewitness accounts, strange lights in the sky, mysterious presences attempting contact.


SHERIFF

Since this whole damned circus has blown into town, no one seems to realize we got four missing persons cases wide open. My friends lost loved ones.


KIM

What happened to him? Something took him! I know it!


WAYNE

We are right in the middle of what we in the field like to call a “UFO flap,” and I am as happy as a pig in shoes.


SHERIFF

I can guarantee you that this has nothing to do with UFO’s, little green men. Nothing extraterrestrial whatsoever.


MARION

Of course it’s not UFO’s. It’s fairies.


DEAN

Fairies. Okay. Well, thank you for your input.


SAM

What? Flying saucers not insane enough for you?


MARION

What newspaper did you say you worked for?


SAM

Okay, if you want to add glitter to that glue you’re sniffing, that’s fine, but don’t dump your whackadoo all over us. We’d rather not step in it.


DEAN

Okay, we’re, we’re done.


SAM

The only thing you’re missing is a couple dozen cats, sister.


DEAN

It’s a blood sugar thing. My apologies.


SAM

What?


DEAN

What? You gotta ask? Right, yes, you do have to ask.


SAM

Look, I’m sorry, but this is all a big joke, right, and we’re not actually taking this UFO crap seriously?


DEAN

No, man. ET is made of rubber. Everybody knows that. But there are four legitimate vanishings in this town. Something’s going on. And Sam? By the way, it’s not the lady’s fault that she took the brown acid.


SAM

Yeah! So?


DEAN

Empathy, man. Empathy. I mean, the old Sam would have given her some, some wussified, dew-eyed crap.


SAM

Old Sam had a soul—was a soul. Whatever.


DEAN.

Right! Yes, and, and, but you don’t—aren’t. Whatever.


SAM

Right


DEAN

Right. You don’t care.


SAM

Well—


DEAN

You have to care!


SAM

About what, exactly?


DEAN

About everything, man! About being human at least.


SAM

Look, Dean. You obviously care. A lot. And that’s great. But I can’t care about what—I can’t care about it, you know? What do you want me to do, fake it?


DEAN

Yes. Absolutely. Fake it. Fake it till you make it.


SAM

What happened to you wanting me to be all honest?


DEAN

Hey, you wanna be a real boy, Pinnochio, you gotta act the part.


SAM

I was faking it Dean! Ever since we got back on the road together, I was picking every freaking word. It’s exhausting.


DEAN

Okay. All Right. But until we get you back on the soul train, I’ll be your conscience, okay?


SAM

So you’re saying you’ll be my… Jiminy Cricket.


DEAN

Shut up. But yeah, you freaking puppet. That’s exactly what I’m saying.



(Brennan’s Watchworks)


DEAN

Mr. Brennan?


MR. BRENNAN

Mmm?


SAM

We’re with The Mirror. We would like to ask you--


MR. BRENNAN

What? Is this about Patrick? Patrick’s gone.


DEAN

Missing. Right. Yes, that’s what we want to talk to you about.


SAM

Now, your son was the first to disappear.


MR. BRENNAN

First to be taken.


SAM

Taken.


MR. BRENNAN

Get out! Out!


DEAN

Mr. Brennan, who do you believe took your son?


MR. BRENNAN

You people can’t help me. My boy is never coming back.


SAM

You sound awfully sure.


MR. BRENNAN

Excuse me?


SAM

Like you know something you’re not talking about.


DEAN

Okay. All right.


MR. BRENNAN

You know what they say. 72 hours. After that, the odds of finding a missing person drop to nothing, right?


DEAN

Well, every case is different.


MR. BRENNAN

It’s been weeks.


DEAN

All right. Listen. Call us if anything comes to mind.



(Sam and Dean leave)


MR. BRENNAN

talks to … thin air*
Is that all right?



(Outside)


SAM

What do you think?


DEAN

I think he’s hiding something.  Why don’t you stay and watch Watchmaker and see what happens when the sun goes down, and I’ll go check out the crop circles.

SAM

Okey dokey.


DEAN

But do NOT engage with, maim or in any way kill Brennan. In fact, I don’t want you making any judgment calls whatsoever. Anything happens, call me.


SAM

You know, Jiminy, I was on my own for a whole year. I did fine without you.


DEAN

Yeah. I don’t want to know your definition of fine.



(Night time. In the cornfield. Dean is looking around. Phone rings.)


DEAN

sigh* What?

SAM

The only thing this guy is up to is alcoholism.


DEAN

Good.


SAM

You know, maybe I should go talk to him again. I mean, you’re the one who said he’s hiding something.


DEAN

Shh! Shh!


SAM

What? You see something? Dean, what’s up?


DEAN

Hang on a second. Holy… UFO! UFO!!


SAM

Whoa! Dude, stop yelling. You’re breaking up. I didn’t catch that last part.


DEAN

Close encounter! Close encounter!


SAM

Close encounter! What kind? First? Second?


DEAN

They’re after me!


SAM

Third kind already? You better run, man. I think the fourth kind is a butt thing.


DEAN

Empathy, Sam! Empathy!


SAM

They still after you?


DEAN

Come on!


SAM

Dean? Are you there? What happened? Dean?

waitress hands him a beer* Thanks.


ACT 2


(Nighttime. Sam is in the cornfield and finds Dean’s ringing phone. Turns it off.)


(Nighttime. RV camp of UFO enthusiasts.)



SAM

So, they’re real. UFO’s.


WAYNE

Like I said before, son, the truth is out there.


SAM

Okay, you’re the expert. How do I get them?


WAYNE

Come again?


SAM

You hunt ET’s, right? I need to know how to get them.


WAYNE

You and me both.


SAM

rifles through UFO literature*
This is it?


WAYNE

Well, I’d say that 30 years of eyewitness accounts speak for themselves as incontrovertible proof—


SAM

Yeah, right. My brother was abducted so I’m pretty good on the whole proof part.


(Pretty girl walks up and joins the conversation.)


SPARROW

Your brother was abducted?


SAM

Yeah.


SPARROW

Oh my God.


SAM

It’s fine. I mean, I’ve had time to adjust.


SPARROW

Did it happen when you were kids?


SAM

No, like, half an hour ago. So, you’ve been hunting UFO’s for over three decades and you basically have no concrete data and zero workable leads.


WAYNE

Well, I—


SAM

Have you considered the possibility that you suck at hunting UFO’s?


SPARROW

I’d like to help. If I can.


SAM

smile*

(Nighttime in the cornfield. Dean is back, yelling and shooting his gun wildly in the air.)

(Dean opens door to motel room and finds Sam in bed with Sparrow.)


SAM

Dean!


DEAN

What the hell?


SPARROW

Oh that’s Dean! Sam, they brought your brother back.


SPARROW

grabbing her clothes*
Okay. It’s all right, Sam. I so totally understand that you need time as a family. But it’s just—what were they like?


DEAN

They were grabby, incandescent douche bags. Good night.


SPARROW

Too soon… ? Okay.


(Sparrow leaves.)


SAM

You’re upset.


DEAN

I was abducted. And you were banging Patchouli.


SAM

I didn’t think she smelled that bad.


DEAN

I was abducted by aliens!


SAM

I was looking into it.


DEAN

Looking into it! I was gone for, like, an hour.


SAM

An hour—


DEAN

And most of that was walking back to town!


SAM

Dean, I think your watch is off. You’ve been gone all night.


DEAN

What are you talking about? No I haven’t. Four a.m.?


SAM

Yeah! UFO time slip. That actually falls in line with a lot of abduction stories.


DEAN

Falls in line…


SAM

Yeah.


DEAN

Nothing’s falling in line.


SAM

Here. Drink. Good.


DEAN

Thank you.


SAM

Yeah. Now. Come on. Talk to me. What happened?


DEAN

Well, uh, there was this… God help me, Sam, there was this bright white light!


SAM

It’s okay.

(Sam pats Dean’s leg. Dean looks at him incredulously.)

Safe room.

DEAN

And then suddenly, I was, uh, I was in a different place. And there were these beings, and they were too bright to look at, but I could feel them pulling me towards this sort of table—


SAM

Probing table!


DEAN

God! Don’t say that out loud!


SAM

Right. So what did you do?


DEAN

I went crazy. I started hacking and slashing and firing. They actually seemed surprised. I don’t think anybody’s ever done that before. Yeah. I had a close encounter, Sam, and I won.


SAM

You should take a shower.


DEAN

I should take a shower. I’m gonna, I’m gonna take a shower now.



(Daytime. In a diner)


DEAN

So, on top of all the demons and the angels and the ghosts and the skinwalkers, it turns out that there’s—so if aliens are actually real, what’s next? Hobbits? Seriously.


(Sam gives a passing girl the silent how ya doin’)


DEAN

You just gave her the silent how ya doin’.


SAM

What?


DEAN

Our reality’s collapsing around us, and you’re trying to pick up our waitress?


SAM

Yeah. Okay. Look. Brings up a question. So, say you got a soul and you’re on a case, and your brother gets abducted by aliens—


DEAN

Yeah, then you do everything you can to get him back.


SAM

Right! You do, but, what about when there are no more leads for the night? Are you supposed to just sit there in the dark and suffer, even when there’s nothing that can be done at that moment?


DEAN

YES!


SAM

What?


DEAN

Yes, you sit in the dark and feel the loss.


SAM

Absolutely! But couldn’t I just do all that and have sex with the hippie chick?


DEAN

No!


SAM

It’d be in the dark.


DEAN

No you couldn’t because you would be suffering, and you can’t just turn that off for the night.


WAITRESS

Thanks, guys.


DEAN

Thank y—


SAM

Why not?


DEAN

Because if you had a soul, your soul wouldn’t let you.


SAM

So you’re saying having a soul equals suffering.


DEAN

Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying.


SAM

Like, the million times you almost called Lisa. So you’re saying suffering is a good thing.


DEAN

I’m saying it’s the only game in town.


SAM

Okay! So how do we deal with the little green men?


DEAN

Research. We’ve got about a century of UFO lore to catch up on, and there’s no time for—What’s up with that guy?


(A guy is standing outside the diner, glaring at Dean. He’s wearing a red cap.)


SAM

Who?


DEAN

The guy by the window giving me the stink eye.


SAM

You mean the cop?


DEAN

No, not the cop! The guy! He’s right—oh now he’s gone!


SAM

Who’s gone?


DEAN

Can we please just get out of here before I hit you?


SAM

Okay! Geez.



(Dean is in motel room, on telephone with Sam)


SAM

Library’s closing up soon. I’m almost done.


DEAN

You find anything?


SAM

Yeah. Way too much. Everyone on the planet believes in UFO’s, and they will not stop writing books about it.


DEAN

Yeah, well at least books have punctuation. All right, keep digging and we’ll see what you got when you get back.



(David Bowie’s Major Thom is playing on the radio in the motel room. The lights start to flicker.)


DEAN

Oh no. Not again.



(Door slams open. Bright ball of light comes flying into the room.)


DEAN

Nipples?



(Bright light punches Dean in the face.)


DEAN

BITCH!



(Dean traps light in the microwave. Splat!)


DEAN

Ha ha. HA-HAA!!


ding*


ACT 3



(Sam and Dean are peering into the microwave.)


SAM

See what?


DEAN

See what? See the blood. See all the blechh.


SAM

Sorry, man. I’m not seeing it.


DEAN

You don’t see the ick? It’s right there.


SAM

Okay, let’s go with you see it and I don’t. What the hell was it?


DEAN

It was a, a little…naked lady, okay?


SAM

It was a what?


DEAN

It was a-- it was a little, glowing, hot naked lady. With nipples. And she hit me.


SAM

I’m not supposed to laugh, right? Right. Okay. Sure. Um. So, shot in the dark here, but did this little lady have wings?


DEAN

What the hell made you say that?


SAM

She did, didn’t she?


DEAN

Yeah, but how did, how’d y—


SAM

One of the fringier theories I came across. It’s actually what crazy crystal lady was yammering about. What if these abductions have nothing to do with UFO’s?


DEAN

What?


SAM

Okay, say these encounters have been going on for centuries, not with extraterrestrials but with ultra-terrestrials. People nowadays say “space aliens “or whatever, but they used to call them—



(Sam spins laptop around)


DEAN

Smurfs.


SAM

Fairies.


DEAN

Fairies? Come on!


SAM

Dean, there’s a straight line between ET’s and fairies. Glowing lights, abductions. It’s all the same UFO stuff, just under a different skin.


DEAN

You seriously think that the secret with UFO’s is—


SAM

Hey, you’re the one who pizza-rolled Tinkerbell. I’m just doing the math. But this is good. This is a lead.


DEAN

A lead where?



(Marion’s trailer. Tea is served. In itty bitty cups.)


MARION

Fairies. Sprites and spriggens. Bogarts and brownies. The little people have many names.


DEAN

(points at figurine)

Well, that’s, uh, that’s her. That’s the little—


MARION

Ooh.


DEAN

Anyway, I, uh, I get that tinkerbells are fairies, but what about the tiny Santa Claus and the troll and the—


MARION

That’s a garden gnome, and that’s a large goblin, and—


DEAN

But they’re all fairies?


MARION

Yes. Faery comes in many shapes and sizes. Magical, mischievous beings from the realm next door.


DEAN

The fairy realm.


MARION

Mm-hmmm.


SAM

So it’s like another dimension?


MARION

Another reality! Yes. Only people who have been there and returned to our world can see the Faery here.


DEAN

Right. Umm, why are the fairies abducting people?


MARION

Mmm. There is much theory and little fact. We know they only take firstborn sons, just like Rumplestiltskin did. Personally, I think they’re taken to Avalon to service Oberon, the King of the Faery.


SAM Dean? Did you service Oberon, King of the Fairies?


DEAN

Marion. Um. Let’s say fairies are real, okay? What can we do about them?


MARION

Sorry?


DEAN

How can we…..


MARION

Interact with them.


DEAN

Yes, yes. Forcefully interact.


MARION

Well, if you want to win a faery’s favor, leave a bowl of fresh cream. They love cream.


DEAN

Okay! And, and, more forcefully?


MARION

Ohhh. All Faery hate iron, and the dark Faery burn when touched with silver. What else. Oh! You can spill sugar or salt in front of them. No matter how powerful, the Faery must stoop to count each grain.


DEAN

Well, allrighty. That’s—Wow! A lot to absorb. Thank you.


MARION

Oh, oh, stay! Finish your tea.


DEAN

I gotta say I, I love the feel—it’s uhh, it’s…


SAM It’s like Sedona, Arizona, crapped in here.


DEAN

Cute-a-riffic! Is what it is.


MARION

laughs*

DEAN

Cute-a-riffic.


SAM

You have bigger cups?



(Sam and Dean are walking outside.)


DEAN

God, is it on me? I feel like I’ve got the crazy on me.


SAM

No. You did sit in some glitter, though.


DEAN

Makes me want to believe in UFO’s again.


SAM

Doesn’t really give us the next move, I grant you that. We can always put the call out to Bobby.



(Sam and Dean see Mr. Brennan buying a flat of cream.)


DEAN

Hey. I’ll be damned. Isn’t that the watch guy?


SAM

Huh. They love cream.



(At Brennan’s Watchworks, and Sam and Dean are watching him carry cream into the store.)


DEAN

All right you stick with half and half, and I’m going to check out his store. And no hippie chicks!



(Dean breaks into back door of Brennan’s Watchworks.)

(Dean sneaks inside and sees brownies making watches.)

(Dean sneaks out again.)


(Sam is at bar watching Mr. Brennan. Phone rings.)


SAM Yeah?


DEAN

Freaking full of Keeblers over here, man. Just full of ‘em.


SAM

What?


DEAN

It’s like the story with the shoe guy and all the elves. Hey, you think Brennan made a deal with a bunch of fairies?


SAM

Lemme get back to you.



(They hang up, and Sam approaches Mr. Brennan at the bar.)


SAM

So, Mr. Brennan. Hello again.


MR. BRENNAN

Leave me alone.


SAM

Did I ever mention how beautiful your work is?


MR. BRENNAN What?


SAM

The watches. Just stunning. What I can’t figure out is how one man can put out that much product. I mean, hell! If I didn’t know better, I’d say you have a bunch of elves working for you. Except I do know better, and you have a bunch of elves working for you.


MR. BRENNAN

You’re insane.


SAM

So, tell me. How does a father decide to trade his son for a bunch of watches? I mean, I assume you have a soul so what’s your excuse?


MR. BRENNAN

You don’t understand. It wasn’t like that.


SAM

Then how was it?



(Dean walks along the sidewalk, sees the Redcap from the diner standing across the street, staring at him again. Dean sneaks away.)



(Back at the bar with Sam and Mr. Brennan.)


MR. BRENNAN

I supported my family for 30 years making those watches. It’s the only thing I know how to do. Parkinson’s. Was losing my hands. I was losing everything. My grandmother, she always used to say that they were real. She told me all of these stories when I was a kid about how to summon them, how to get favors from them.


SAM

So you learned how to work a spell.


MR. BRENNAN

I mean, honestly, I doubted it would even work. I was just desperate. But she left me this book, so I did the ceremony in my back office two months ago, and this man appeared and said he was a leprechaun.


SAM

A leprechaun.


MR. BRENNAN

I asked him just to cure my hands, but he said he would do even better. He would make me more successful than I had ever been. He told me he’d bring a crew of workers, that I could save my business, save my name.


SAM

In exchange for?


MR. BRENNAN

He just wanted a place for them to rest, to take of the fruit and fat of the land. I said yes. I wasn’t thinking.


SAM

And the fruit and the fat was?


MR. BRENNAN

My firstborn. Not just mine. There’s been others. They’re not stopping. They’re not going to stop.


SAM

There’s gotta be a way to reverse the spell.


MR. BRENNAN

There is. But the book is in a safe in my shop. They won’t let me near it. It’s been a nightmare.


SAM

You can see the fairies?


MR. BRENNAN

Yes.



(Dean is walking down the sidewalk, trying to avoid the Redcap. He ducks into an alley and the Redcap follows. Dean turns a corner and flattens himself against a wall then launches out and tackles a little person.)


LITTLE PERSON

Wha---? Help! Help!


DEAN

Little fairy! What do you want, you fairy? Huh? Huh? Fairy!!


LITTLE GIRL

screams* Daddy!!

DEAN

Oh God no. Haha! I’m just kidding!



(Sam and Mr. Brennan turn a corner and are walking down the same street Dean is on. Sam is trying to call Dean on his phone.)


SAM

Don’t worry, Brennan. We can do this. My brother and I are gonna cover you while you reverse the ritual.



(Sam sees Dean being cuffed and arrested. There’s a small crowd of onlookers.)


SAM

Dean!! Hey dude! What happened?


DEAN

Sam…. Hey!



(Dean is thrown into back seat of police car)


SAM

What am I supposed to do?


DEAN

Fight the fairies. You fight those fairies. FIGHT THE FAIRIES!!



ACT FOUR



(Dean is in jail.)


SHERIFF

I’m just trying to understand exactly what kind of hate crime this even was.


DEAN

It wasn’t a hate crime.


SHERIFF

I mean, if this gentleman were a full-sized homosexual, would that be okay with you?


DEAN

I don’t hate any size person, or any size… gay… guy.


SHERIFF

He’s not gay as it happens. But! He is the district attorney for Tipton County. Runs a tight ship, tell you what.


DEAN

I’d say he’s done so well for himself, considering his…considering these tough economic times.


SHERIFF

Son, you are all kinds of messed up.


(The sheriff leaves Dean in jail to pace for hours.)



(Brennan Watchmakers. Sam and Mr. Brennan sneak into the back door.)


SAM

Are they here?


MR. BRENNAN

Yeah, but it’s all right. Greenhats like tequila.



(Mr. Brennan sneaks over to his safe and gets the spell book.)


MR. BRENNAN

(phonetic) lich sha-hayt. Uh keeya shun, augus small un sorashun, augus phooetek en shia, en rache connecsha….


(Redcap leprechaun stabs Mr. Brennan in the back.)


SAM

You! You’re the leprechaun?


WAYNE WHITAKER /LEPRECHAUN

Indeed I am. Sorry about the mess, but your friend here went back on his deal.


SAM

Well, you weren’t very clear with him on the terms.


WAYNE /LEPRECHAUN

I told him there was a price. Once we come, we come to stay.


SAM

So you take firstborns and then what? You just sit back and watch while they cover the abductions for you with all that crazy UFO crap? Which you help encourage, naturally. Nice con. But, your cover’s blown now, *Wayne.*


WAYNE /LEPRECHAUN

Blown? To whom? Brennan’s dead. Your brother? Heh. He’s marked. Been to the ranch. He’s ours now.


SAM

Yeah. Well. Then there’s me.


WAYNE /LEPRECHAUN

You? But you can only see me if I let you.



(The leprechaun disappears.)


SAM

True, but you’ll have to get near me eventually, and I have very good reflexes.



(The leprechaun reappears.)


WAYNE /LEPRECHAUN

You’re not like the rest of them, are you?


SAM

Nope.


WAYNE /LEPRECHAUN

I could see that right off. You’re missing a certain piece, right in the center, ain’t you?


SAM

Says who?


WAYNE /LEPRECHAUN

We fairy folk? We’re all about energy. And the human soul gives off a certain perfume. Your soul is far away. But not completely out of reach.


SAM

Is that so?


WAYNE/ LEPRECHAUN

Sam, I can get it back for you. For a price.


SAM

That’s adorable. It’s locked in a box with the devil.


WAYNE/LEPRECHAUN

Your devil. Not mine.


SAM

There’s no freaking way a leprechaun can do what angels cannot.


WAYNE/LEPRECHAUN

Angels. *laughs* Please. I’m talking about real magic, sonny. From my side of the fence. Got a way of getting in back doors.


SAM

So you’re my blue fairy? You can make me a real boy again?


WAYNE /LEPRECHAUN

When you wish upon a star.


SAM

Yeah. I got a wish.


(Sam shoots the leprechaun.)


WAYNE /LEPRECHAUN

Iron!! Painful, but not a deal breaker.


(Sam shoots the leprechaun again.)



(Dean, dejected, is in jail sitting on the cot. The redcap appears next to him. The Redcap laughs, pats Dean on the back and proceeds to beat him up.)



(Back in the watchmaker’s shop, Sam and the leprechaun are at fisticuffs. The magic demon-killing knife does not work on the leprechaun. Meanwhile, back at the jail, the assbeating continues.)


WAYNE/LEPRECHAUN

Come on, lad. You’ve already taken your best shot.


SAM

You’re right. I’m done shootin’. So do me a favor. And count this.



(Sam empties a vial of salt onto the floor.)


WAYNE/LEPRECHAUN

Oh no.


SAM

Why didn’t I do that earlier?



(The leprechaun starts counting while Sam finishes the spell.)


SAM

(phonetic) Kum savaltcha…


LEPRECHAUN

mutters*
One… three… ass.


SAM

(phonetic) Ar noyang, kun enna, ret augus…


LEPRECHAUN

Dammit.


SAM

Kkuum doinsha and getta wabasach shul!


(The fairies disappear from the watchmaker’s shop and from the jail.)



END TAG


(Sam and Dean are by the car. Dean offers Sam a beer, and he refuses. Dean has a beer.)


DEAN

So. Here’s to the tiniest DA. At least they’re dropping the charges.


SAM

Little big man.


DEAN

I was wondering something.


SAM

Yeah?


DEAN

You think Lucky Charms really could have , you know, soul to sender?


SAM

Come on. It’s crazy to think. He did talk a good game though.


DEAN

You said no. Why?


SAM

It was a deal. When’s a deal ever been a good thing?


DEAN

I’m just trying to figure out how it works in there.


SAM

Dude, I do still have all my brain cells. If anything, my brain works better now.


DEAN

Just making sure that’s where your head’s at. That you’re not having second thoughts about getting your soul back.


SAM

Oh.


DEAN

You’re not, are you?


SAM

No.
