Dodge City, Kansas

[Night, in a graveyard. An owl hoots as Dean and a man in a white cowboy hat (Sarge) search the graveyard with flashlights. A train whistle blows in the distance as something rustles nearby. Dean and Sarge aim rifles in the direction of the sound, but see nothing.]
SARGE: What the hell?
DEAN: Come on.
[An owl hoots again as they proceed cautiously, guns raised.]
DEAN: Where'd he go?
[They hear the rustling sound on the other side of the graveyard now and turn to head back that way.]
DEAN: He's messin' with us.
SARGE: He's too damn fast.
DEAN: Not faster than bullets.
[Dean heads off in one direction, and gives Sarge a hand signal to head the other around a crypt. They meet up at the opposite side of the building.]
DEAN: All right, you wait here. I'm-a flush him out.
[Sarge covers Dean while he heads out into the graveyard. As soon as Dean's back is turned, a hand reaches up through the ground below Sarge, grabs his ankle, and pulls him underground.]
SARGE: Aah!
[Dean turns around to see a hole in the ground and Sarge's hat, rifle, and flashlight lying on the ground, and runs back to investigate. He looks down into the tunnel.]
DEAN: Sarge? Aw, hell.

TITLE CARD
48 Hours Earlier

[exterior, the alleyway from the end of 13.05, Sam and Dean beside the Impala, and Cas waiting for them by the phone booth]
DEAN: Cas, is that really you?
SAM: No. You're – you're dead.
CASTIEL: Yeah, I was. But then I… annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me back.
SAM: I don't even know what to say.
DEAN: I do. Welcome home, pal.
[Dean embraces Cas, and then Sam hugs Cas]
CASTIEL: How long was I gone?
DEAN: Too damn long.
SAM: Where were you? In Heaven?
CASTIEL: No. No, I was in the Empty.
DEAN: Really?
CASTIEL: Apparently, it's where angels and demons go when they die.
SAM: What was it like?
CASTIEL: Well, it's dark and...nothing.
[we see scenes from 13.04, of Cas’s experiences in the Empty]
CASTIEL: It's like...nothing. I was sleeping, and then I heard a voice that said my name, and I woke up. I thought you… had done something.
DEAN: No, we… we didn't even think we could bring you back.
SAM: So who was it? Chuck – uh, God?
CASTIEL: No. No, he has no power in the Empty.
DEAN: Well, then, who does?
SAM: Jack.

[Interior, the bunker’s library, Jack is typing away at his laptop when Dean and Sam enter.]
JACK: How'd it go?
DEAN: Well…
SAM: Jack, um…
JACK: What's wrong?
CASTIEL: Hello, Jack.
JACK: Castiel?
CASTIEL: [Sighs] Yeah, it's me.
JACK: No. We burned your body, and what's burned stays dead. How...
DEAN: Well, that's the question we've been askin'.
SAM: Jack… did you, uh… Did you bring Cas back?
JACK: I don't know. I wanted him back. I… begged for him to come back, but...
DEAN: Well, here he is.
JACK: Because of me?
SAM: We don't know. We don't know, Jack. But we– we– we think maybe.
CASTIEL: Thank you, Jack.
[Jack walks over to Cas and hugs him, while Dean stands at the opposite end of the table looking on.]
JACK: I missed you so much.
CASTIEL: Sam and Dean tell me you're doing well.
JACK: I am. I… Watch this.
[Jack walks back to the table and levitates a pencil for a few seconds, then chuckles.]
SAM: Wow.
JACK: I can move the pencil. And… I found a case. Hunter's case.
DEAN: What kind of a–
JACK: Zombies. [He whispers confidentially to Cas] I know what zombies are now. [He pulls the came info up on the computer] You see?
DEAN: Wait. Where'd you learn to do that?
JACK: By watching you. And Sam. Three days ago, a vintage pocket watch with a personal inscription was sold at a pawn shop. But when they went to authenticate it, they found out that it'd been buried with its owner… 20 years ago. And when they checked out the grave, it was empty. Which means… the dead are rising in Dodge City, Kansas.
♪ [Cowboy music plays as a dreamy expression crosses Dean's face. Cas glances up as if he heard the music as well, and Dean looks down to hide his smile… Jack glances between the two of them, confused.]
SAM: Right. O-or maybe it's a-a grave robbery, but…
JACK: Oh.
DEAN: Yeah, but we should probably check it out.
CASTIEL: Wait. Really?
DEAN: Yeah, we've done more on less. Besides Dodge City's kind of, uh, kind of awesome. All right, well… two salty hunters, one half-angel kid, and a dude who just came back from the dead. Again. Team Free Will 2.0. Here we go.
[At the Stampede Motel in Dodge City, TFW 2.0 finds their room]
DEAN: All right, this is supposed to be the best room in the joint.
[Dean unlocks the door, and switches on the light]
DEAN: Oh, ho! The Wild Bill suite.
[Dean laughs as he looks around at all the cowboy decor, horse paintings, horns, antlers, animal heads, and photos of famous old west figures]
SAM: Wow.
[Sam, Cas, and Jack are more bewildered than impressed, but Dean's having the time of his life]
DEAN: Pretty cool, right? Dude! Check it out, check it out, check it out. Clay Allison – gun fighter extraordinaire, right? And, uh, Curly Bill Brocius, which – now, now, now, little fun fact here – was killed by Wyatt Earp himself. Not kidding. Johnny Ringo, Billy the Kid. Oh, look!
JACK [in an aside to Castiel]: He really likes cowboys.
DEAN: [boops a stuffed buffalo head on the nose] Hey, big guy. How you doin'? That's… What's going on, Calamity Jane?
CASTIEL [to Jack]: Yes. Yes, he does.
DEAN: Doc Holliday! Hey-oh! This is awesome. All right, I say quick shower, steak dinner, and then tomorrow, we hit up the cemetery.
SAM: Sounds like a plan.
[A set of swinging saloon doors creak as Dean goes to the bedroom and we hear him call out from the next room]
DEAN: Oh, yes! Stirrup hangers!
JACK [to Cas]: You can have the couch if you want. I don't sleep much.
CASTIEL: I don't sleep at all.

[interior, the Wild Bill Suite, bedroom, Sam enters as Dean’s unpacking]
SAM: Still can't believe you brought your own hat.
DEAN: Well, I can't believe you didn't.
SAM: You're in a good mood, huh?
DEAN: Yeah. And?
SAM: Nothing. No, no, I-I-I just, uh… you've been having a rough go, so it's… it's good to see you smile.
DEAN: Well, I said I needed a big win. We got Cas back. That's a pretty damn big win.
SAM: Yeah. Fair enough.

[Night, a police car has pulled over behind another apparently abandoned vehicle on a foggy roadside. The cop calls in to dispatch over a staticky radio]
CARL: Run that plate, would you, Sophie?
SOPHIE [on the radio]: Copy, Carl. Will do.
CARL: Let's see who this pile of junk belongs to.
[Carl sees the passenger door of the apparently abandoned truck open, and gets out of his car to investigate. He approaches the truck cautiously, shining his light into the empty cab, when he hears the radio from inside his car]
SOPHIE: Carl, we got a match on that plate. Looks like the truck was stolen.
[He hears a rustling noise across the street and turns to investigate, but while his back's turned the truck's door slams shut. When he turns back to the truck, he hears the noise behind him again, and turns again, and is grabbed by the ankles and dragged under the truck.]
CARL: Aah!
SOPHIE: Carl? Carl? Is everything all right? Carl, do you copy?

ACT II

[Sam and Dean are asleep in their motel beds, while Cas and Jack sit at the table talking quietly while Jack researches on his laptop]
JACK: And then there were these angels and they tried to kill me, but… I thought angels were good?
CASTIEL: Well, in Heaven, "good's" a relative term.
JACK: What's it like? Heaven?
CASTIEL: Well, that depends.
JACK: But it's nice?
CASTIEL: It can be.
JACK: That's good. My mother's in Heaven.
CASTIEL: Yeah, I know she is. Kelly was… She was a very brave woman.
JACK: She left me a message. She said I had an angel watching over me.
CASTIEL [sighs]: Jack, I'm so sorry. I-I should've been here for you.
JACK: No. It's okay. It's just… I understand why she trusted you. Why I trusted you.
CASTIEL: You remember that?
JACK: I remember feeling… safe.
CASTIEL: Jack, your mother, she believed that you would do amazing things. She said that you would change the world for the better. And now, looking at you, talking to you, I know that she was right, that we were right. Kelly would be so proud of you.
[The laptop beeps, drawing Jack's attention. He types something in and it beeps again, turning the laptop to show Cas what he's found]
JACK: Oh, wow. I'll go tell them.
CASTIEL: Jack. Jack!
[Jack jumps up and rushes to wake up Dean, while Cas attempts to stop him. Jack taps Dean's shoulder anyway, as Cas rushes into the room]
JACK: Dean? Dean?
CASTIEL: Jack, I wouldn't do that!
DEAN: Aah!
[Dean wakes up violently, pulling a gun from beneath his pillow and aiming it at Jack]
JACK: No, no, no! Dean, it's me. It's me.
[Cas stands by the swinging saloon doors in resignation]
DEAN: Ah, hey. Who's making me coffee?
[Dean relaxes and lays back down]

[Some time later, after sunrise, Dean pours coffee into a mug in the motel room and shuffles over to slump down on the sofa and slurp his coffee as he wakes up]
CASTIEL: I told you. He's an angry sleeper. Like a bear.
SAM: Okay, so "code three" means an officer down. Looks like the victim was–
JACK: Covered in bite marks. Like from a zombie.
DEAN: Or anything else that has teeth.
SAM: All right, change of plans. Jack and I will hit the graveyard. You and Cas hit up the crime scene.
DEAN: Works for me.
[Sam and Jack get up to leave, and Cas rises as well, but Dean holds up one finger, and then points at his coffee. Without a word, Cas sits back down to wait for Dean to finish.]
DEAN: Ahh.

[Dean and Cas drive up to the crime scene along the highway where Carl was killed and park a short distance away. They remain in the car, Cas wearing a cowboy hat with a hat band advertising their motel, and discuss their strategy.]
DEAN: All right, listen, these Dodge City cops aren't likely to trust big city folks, so we're gonna have to blend.
CASTIEL: Which is why you're making me wear this absurd hat.
DEAN: It's not that bad. Well, actually, yeah, it kind of is. Hang on. [Dean reaches over and removes the hat band and tosses it in the back seat] All right. That's better.
CASTIEL: Is it?
DEAN: [sighs] Yeah. Look, just act like you're from Tombstone, okay?
CASTIEL: The city?
DEAN: The movie. With Kurt Russell? I made you watch it.
CASTIEL: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The one with the guns and tuberculosis. [in a deep cowboy voice] "I'm your Huckleberry."
DEAN: Yeah, exactly. Well, it's good to have you back, Cas. All right, follow my lead. We'll fit right in.

[As they exit the car, Dean puts on his own cowboy hat, and we see his cowboy boots. They walk in slow motion together toward the crime scene as Steve Miller's "Space Cowboy" plays]
♪ I told you 'bout living in the U.S. of A. ♪ ♪ Don't you know that I'm a gangster of love? ♪ ♪ I'm a space cowboy ♪ ♪ Bet you weren't ready for that ♪
[They pass someone investigating the crime scene]
CASTIEL: Howdy, pardner.
DEAN: Who's in charge here?
[The officer points out the person in charge]
CASTIEL: Much obliged.
♪ I'm sure you know where it's at ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪
DEAN: Sheriff Phillips?
[Record needle scratches and the music stops as we meet Sarge from the cold open]
SARGE: It's Sarge. Sergeant Joe Phillips. Sheriff's on vacation.
DEAN: Well, I'm Agent Russell. This here is my associate.
[Cas looks confusedly at Dean, and Dean tilts his head encouraging him to introduce himself. Minor awkwardness ensues all around.]
CASTIEL: Uh, Kilmer. My name is Val Kilmer.
SARGE: Yeah, okay. What do you want?
DEAN: Well, we heard about the attack over the wire last night. Wondering what you can tell us about the victim.
SARGE: His name was Carl Phillips. Deputy Carl Phillips. He's… was my nephew. Some psycho slit his throat and left the body out for the coyotes to chew on. I knew that boy since he was a day old.
CASTIEL: Well, we're deeply sorry for your loss.
[Sarge clears his throat, looking down at the ground]
SARGE: Anyway, what the hell's the Texas Rangers even doing up here?
CASTIEL: Well, actually, we're FB–
DEAN: Rangers. That's right. Texas Rangers.
SARGE: Mm-hmm.
DEAN: We've been tracking a fugitive who skipped across state lines. He's a real mean son of a gun. He's been robbing graves.
SARGE: Oh. We got us one of them. Carl was the one looking in on it. You think there's a connection?
DEAN: Could be.
SARGE: Well, you boys are more than welcome to poke around, but… I catch up with your runner first, there ain't gonna be much left of him to take back to Texas.
You can count on it.
DEAN: Mm.

[At the funeral home adjacent to the cemetery where the grave robberies occurred, Messer Chups' "They Call Me Zombie" playing while a mortician wearing pink headphones prepares a body for burial with bubblegum pink embalming fluid]
♪ They call me zombie, I don't know why ♪ ♪ They call me zombie ♪
[Sam and Jack enter the room, but the woman can't hear them speaking over the music and her back is to them as she works. After several attempts to get her attention, she finally turns and is startled to see them standing there.]
♪ They call me zombie, I don't know why ♪
ATHENA: Dude! What the hell?
SAM: Sorry. Sorry, I-I didn't mean to scare– Um, there was no one upstairs.
ATHENA: Yeah, it's just me.
SAM: And you are…
ATHENA: Athena Lopez, undertaker. And you are?
SAM: Agent Elliot. [Sam points to Jack, but Jack's wandered off looking around the room] That's Agent Paxton. FBI.
ATHENA: He's an FBI agent? [Scoffs] Did his parents sign a permission slip?
SAM: He's a trainee. Top of his class. Anyway, we're here about the grave robbery. Uh, you live on the premises, right?
ATHENA: All my life.
SAM: But according to the police report, you didn't see anyone that night.
ATHENA: I was out. Amanda Palmer concert.
SAM: Amanda Palmer?
JACK: What about anything weird? Cold spots? Strange smells?
[Sam clears his throat pointedly in Jack's direction, since he's not asking the right questions.]
ATHENA: I just said, I wasn't here.
[Sam laughs and tries to cover up for Jack]
SAM: Right. We're just trying to figure out what happened. That's all.
ATHENA: You and me both. Look, if you guys wanna check out the grave, the cops have it roped off, over on the west plot.
SAM: Great. Thanks. Again, sorry.

[exterior, Sam and Jack walk through the graveyard. Jack holds the EMF meter, which warbles wildly]
JACK: There's something here. No, wait. There.
[Sam laughs]
SAM: Jack, put that away. We're in a graveyard. There's gonna be EMF everywhere.
JACK: The police report said something about rats damaging the coffin.
[Sam opens the coffin, where most of one end is missing]
SAM: That's one big rat.
JACK: Yeah.
SAM: All right. Here goes nothin'.
[Sam sighs, jumps down into the grave, and begins digging through the dirt at one end. He pulls out a bone and holds it up]
JACK: What's that?
SAM: I think it's...

[Back at the motel, Dean inspects the bone]
DEAN: Leftovers.
SAM: Yeah, bite marks. Looks like a ghoul.
[Jack looks to Castiel, confused]
CASTIEL: Oh, a ghoul is a monster that feeds on the dead. They can take the form of whomever they've eaten. Decapitation kills them.
DEAN: Yeah, or bashing their brains in.
[Dean tosses the bone to Cas]
JACK: So like a… zombie shape-shifter?
SAM: Pretty much, yeah. And he could have tunnels all over that graveyard.
JACK: But if it could be anyone, how do we find it?

[Athena is listening to her headphones as she walks around the mortuary. Thaddeus Rose & The Thorns' "Hot Rod Rockin'" playing as a shadowy figure follows behind her]
♪ I'm gonna rock… ♪

[Back in the motel room, Dean opens a beer and tosses the bottle cap.]
DEAN: Can I just say I'm getting real sick and tired of fighting things that look like other things?
CASTIEL: Maybe the ghoul is this Athena.
SAM: Yeah. A-a ghoul who owns a mortuary. That's smart, but…
DEAN: No. She's got access to the bodies before they're ever in the ground. Anything she wants, she would just take. She doesn't have to dig 'em back up.
SAM: Right.

[Athena prepares another body, still listening to her headphones, as the shadowy figure looms behind her.]

[Jack finds something on his computer and shows the others]
JACK: I think I found something. I tracked the plates on the stolen truck from the crime scene, and I went through the city's traffic camera footage, and look. This is it. From yesterday, before the deputy was killed.
DEAN: Well, then, who's drivin'?
[Dean kneels down and zooms in on the traffic camera footage to see the driver.]
DEAN: Holy crap. That's Dave Mather.

[At the mortuary, the shadowy figure approaches Athena and slaps her rear as she's bent over the body she's working on. It's Dave Mather, from the traffic camera image, wearing a black cowboy hat, and the scene continues to switch back and forth between TFW 2.0 in the motel and Dave and Athena at the mortuary.]

SAM and CASTIEL: Who?
DEAN: Dave Mather.

ATHENA: Dave! Not cool.
DAVE: What? It's your own fault, bent over all sexy.
ATHENA: I don't like when you do that.
DAVE: You do like it. Sometimes.

DEAN: Cowboy. Outlaw. One of the Dodge City gang.

DAVE: Come here.
[Dave pulls Athena into a kiss, and she smiles]

[Dean pulls Dave Mather's photo down off the wall as the cowboy music starts up again.]
DEAN: He was one of the greatest gunfighters ever. I mean, he died in 1886, which makes this a little weird, but… [Laughs] Mysterious Dave Mather. I'm gonna get my boots on. One of the best gunslingers ever! Whoo!

DAVE: You got a letter, and it's from that makeup school. Thought you said you weren't gonna apply.
ATHENA: Changed my mind. And it's not "that makeup school." It's the Ben Carruth Makeup and Special Effects Program. It's the best.
DAVE: The Carruth Program. Got it.
ATHENA: [reading the letter aloud] "Dear Ms. Lopez, after reviewing your portfolio, we've decided to accept you into our fall semester." Babe, I got in.
DAVE: Cool.
ATHENA: Don't get too excited.
DAVE: No, I… I think it's great that you got in that.
ATHENA: But?
DAVE: But it's in Los Angeles, and we're not exactly swimming in cash here. City living, it's expensive.
ATHENA: Yeah, and they've got loans. I could sell this place if I needed to.
DAVE: Athena, don't you think we have a good thing here? Why do you wanna go mess it up?
ATHENA: Whatever. I have to work.
DAVE: Athena.
ATHENA: Two FBI agents came by today.
DAVE: What for?
ATHENA: It was about the grave robbery, but they asked these weird questions about cold spots, strange smells.

[At the motel, TFW 2.0 get ready to hunt, checking weapons]
DEAN: So our ghoul ate some Old West gunfighter and stole his face?
SAM: That's what it looks like.
DEAN: Ha.
JACK: I think I've seen him before. There was a picture at the mortuary. He's Athena's boyfriend.

[The Impala pulls up outside the mortuary. Jack and Cas stay in the back seat, while Dean and Sam get out]
DEAN: All right.
SAM: So what do we tell Athena?
DEAN: Well, we keep it simple, tell her the guy she's banging eats dead people, and we're here to kill him. Or we could lie.
SAM: Yeah, we definitely lie.
[They descend to the mortuary and find Athena]
DEAN: Athena?
ATHENA: What the hell are you doing in my house? Again.
SAM: Look, I-I'm a...
ATHENA: I know who you are. Answer the question.
SAM: Okay, my– my associate and I, we're– we're looking for your boyfriend.
ATHENA: Why? Is this about the grave robbery?
DEAN: And a murder.
ATHENA: A what?
DEAN: Sheriff's deputy was killed last night.
SAM: We just wanna talk to him. That's all. So… do you know where he is?
ATHENA: He said he had to go to the bank.

[inside the Stagecoach Credit Union, a guard holds the door while a customer leaves]
GUARD: Have a good night, ma'am. [He walks to the teller] Hey, Shawnte. Locking up.
SHAWNTE: Okay, sounds good.
[Dave enters the bank wearing a bandana as a mask and brandishing a gun in the guard's face]
DAVE: Howdy, pardner.

ACT III

[Inside the Stagecoach Credit Union, the teller and guard fill a bag with cash while Dave holds them at gunpoint]
DAVE: You hit that alarm, you die. You hand me that funny wad of cash with the dye pack in it, you die. [he points his gun at the guard] You. You try and play hero, big boy, you die. You got me?
[When Dave leaves the bank, Dean is waiting in the parking lot for him]
DEAN: Dave Mather. Robbing a bank. That's a bold move.
DAVE: You must be the Hunter.
DEAN: And you must like to play cowboy.
DAVE: It's my favorite suit. You know, I like to keep a little piece of old Dave on me just to gnaw on.
[Off to Dave's side, Sam cocks his gun and draws Dave's attention to him, Cas, and Jack. Dave laughs.]
DAVE: Let's make it two, three, four Hunters! Whoo! [Sniffs] Must be my birthday.
SAM: Look, why don't you come with us someplace else? We can do this quick and quiet.
[Dave responds by drawing his gun, so Sam fires at him and misses. Dave fires back, and a gunfight breaks out as everyone ducks for cover behind cars, and Cas and Jack duck behind a stagecoach]
CASTIEL: Are you all right?
JACK: Yeah.
DAVE: Whoo!
[The gunfight continues, as many cars are damaged and windows shatter]
CASTIEL: Okay, you stay here.
JACK: No, it's okay. I've got this.
CASTIEL: No, Jack. Jack!
[Jack walks out to confront Dave, and Cas follows after him. Meanwhile, the guard inside the bank tries to help.]
GUARD: Stay here.
CASTIEL: Jack! Jack!
JACK: Hey!
[Dave fires several shots that hit Jack in the chest, but Jack is unharmed.]
DAVE: What the hell?
[The security guard reaches Dave just as Jack throws a blast of power at Dave, sending them both flying backward. The guard crashes into a post, but Dave rolls and gets up to run away.]
JACK: No.
DEAN [to Sam, as he runs off to chase Dave]: Check the guard.
JACK: No!
SAM: No. No, no, no, no.
[Sam, Jack, and Cas run to help the guard while Dean chases after Dave on foot until he loses sight of him. Meanwhile the guard lays in a spreading blood pool.]
JACK: Cas, I-I didn't mean to. Castiel, you have to heal him.
[Castiel attempts to heal the guard, but isn't able to]
CASTIEL: I can't.
JACK: Why– why not?
SAM: He's dead.

ACT IV

[Back at the motel, thunder rumbles outside. Jack sits on the sofa while Sam, Dean, and Cas confer in the bedroom]
CASTIEL: Is this the first time he's hurt anyone?
SAM: No. No, but it is the first time he's hurt someone that didn't get back up.
DEAN: All right, you two should get Jack back to the bunker.
SAM: What?
DEAN: The cops are gonna be on their way. We gotta get him out of town.
CASTIEL: Okay, but what– what about the ghoul? I can stay here.
DEAN: No, I'll handle it. Besides, you need to be with the kid in case he… you know.
CASTIEL: [sighs heavily] Okay. All right.


[Athena walks through the mortuary, as Dave grunts and stumbles down the stairs]
DAVE: Ha. Hey, baby.
ATHENA: Dave, what happened?
DAVE: Uh, I got shot.
ATHENA: Oh, my God.
DAVE: Ow! [Athena worriedly checks his wound as Dave laughs] It's not a big deal. Hey, I robbed a bank for you.
ATHENA: What are you talking about?
DAVE: I-I… I changed my mind. You can go to that school, and I'm gonna come with you. Okay? But we gotta leave now. So big city, here we come.
ATHENA: Are you insane?
DAVE: No, look, I can pawn jewelry for stuff like concert tickets. But if we're skipping down, digging up a few bodies just ain't gonna cut it.
ATHENA: You're the grave robber? But that would mean… That cop that got killed?
DAVE: That– that pissant Deputy Carl, he was tailing me. I had no choice. I had to do it. I had to do it.
ATHENA: You killed someone.
DAVE: Who had it coming. But it doesn't matter now anyways. Baby… [He's slowly backing her across the room as she tries to put more distance between them] We need to leave. Now. Okay?
ATHENA: Don't touch me.
DAVE: Hey. I'm the one that's giving you everything that you ever wanted. So how 'bout you stop being a bitch, okay? Athena… [Dave grabs Athena and she gasps, afraid] You're with me, and I will always take care of you and I will always protect you. But we need to get the hell out of Dodge now.
ATHENA: Just get away from me.
DAVE: Baby. Baby!
[As they struggle, headlights shine in through the window]
DAVE: Damn.

[Outside the mortuary, Sarge stands by his truck, his rifle over his shoulder, as Dean pulls up and gets out]
SARGE: Y'all looking for someone? 'Cause I am. Bank in town just got robbed. Turned into a real O.K. Corral type of deal. Big old shootout.
DEAN: I heard about that.
SARGE: Mm-hmm. Shawnte, the clerk, recognized the perp's voice. She said he sounded just like the fella that's been dating Athena.
DEAN: That so?
SARGE: And we got prints back from the murder. They matched prints from the bank. That boy's been busy. I already checked his place. It's cleaned out, but I figure he ain't goin' nowhere without his best girl. So that's why I'm here. Why are you here?
DEAN: Same thing. Trying to get the bad guy. Where's your badge?
SARGE: I don't need one. This is family business.
DEAN: Well, I should tell you I'm not taking him alive.
SARGE: Neither am I.
DEAN: All right, then. Uh, aim for the head.

[The scene from the cold open, Dean and Sarge search the graveyard for the ghoul, Dave]
SARGE: What the hell?
DEAN: Come on.
[cut to Dean and Sarge meeting up after circling the mausoleum]
DEAN: All right, you wait here. I'm-a flush him out.
[Sarge is grabbed and pulled underground]
SARGE: Aah!
DEAN: Sarge? Aw, hell.
[Dean kneels at the edge of the tunnel entrance, debating about how to crawl down]
DEAN: Mnh-mnh! No, I don't wanna – Okay.
[He dives into the hole head first, flashlight in one hand and rifle in the other]
DEAN: Ugh.
[His gun gets caught by a protruding rock in the tunnel and he has to stop and yank it free]
DEAN: Uhh! Perfect.
[He spits dirt out of his mouth]
DEAN: Yeah. Sure. Come to Dodge City. We'll have some laughs. Ugh.

[Rain falls and thunder rumbles as Sam drives Cas and Jack back to the bunker in the Impala]
SAM: Jack, you, uh… you okay?
CASTIEL: Jack, I've killed people who didn't deserve it… my friends– I've killed people I loved. I wish I could tell you that it– that it gets easier, that with time, it hurts less, but that would be a lie because it– it never gets easier. And those moments, they never stop hurting. But that doesn't mean that you should stop fighting. Doesn't mean that just because you made a mistake – and that's what this is, Jack. It's a mistake. That doesn't mean that you can't– can't be better, do better. I believe that. I have to believe that.
SAM: And we still believe in you, Jack. We, uh–
JACK: Stop. Just… Please stop.

[Inside the mortuary, the graveyard tunnel opens behind an old crematorium door, and Dean crawls out and falls to the ground]
DEAN: Aah!
[When he gets to his feet, he finds Athena tied to a chair]
DEAN: [whispers as he moves over to untie Athena] Hey. Hey. Hey. You okay?
ATHENA: No. What the hell is going on?
DEAN: Okay, well, your boyfriend, uh, is not exactly human.
ATHENA: What?
[Across the room, Sarge groans as he regains consciousness, and Dean runs to check on him]
DEAN: Hey. Hey, Sarge. Hey, hey. Hey, you okay?
SARGE: Still kickin'.
DEAN: Okay.
SARGE: Just barely. That sumbitch dragged me down here, tossed me around like I was a damn rag doll.
DEAN: You got any idea where he is?
SARGE: A little bit.
[A gun cocks behind Dean's head, and he turns to see Dave standing behind him]
DAVE: Hands up. Oh, I think you heard me. Raise 'em! High! Attaboy.
ATHENA: Dave? Don't.
DAVE: It's okay. I'm doing this for us, baby.
ATHENA: There is no "us."
DEAN: Ooh. Ouch. Breakups can be a bitch.
DAVE: Shut up.
DEAN: Or what?
DAVE: Or I'm gonna put a bullet right between your eyes. I mean, what'd you think was gonna happen here? You come down with no gun. Like it matters anyway. You ain't fast enough.
DEAN: No, but he is.
[Dean takes one step to the side, revealing Sarge on the floor behind him, aiming Dean's rifle at Dave. Sarge fires and kills Dave]
DEAN: Happy trails, cowboy.

ACT V

[Morning in the graveyard, Dean and Sarge walk back to their cars]
SARGE: So, you mind telling me exactly what went on back there?
DEAN: Sure. Guy named Dave killed your deputy. He tried to kill you, and you shot him dead. And I was never here.
SARGE: Fair enough.
DEAN: And the, uh, security guard at the bank, Dave killed him, too.

[Dean arrives back in the bunker, where Jack's sitting at the library table alone and contemplative. Sam sits at the war room table across from Cas.]
SAM: Hey.
DEAN: Hey.
SAM: How'd it go?
DEAN: Usual. Killed the bad guy, saved the girl.
SAM: What about the, uh…
DEAN: Took care of it.
SAM: Good.
JACK: Good? How is that good? I killed someone. What was his name? The guard? Did he have a family?
CASTIEL: Jack, don't do this to yourself.
JACK: No, did he?
DEAN: Yes, he did.
SAM: Jack, look, this life, what we do, it's… it's not easy. And we've all done things we regret.
JACK: Just don't. You're afraid of me.
CASTIEL: Jack, no.
JACK: No, maybe you're right. Maybe I'm just another monster.
DEAN: No, you're not. I thought you were. I did. But… Like Sam said, we've all done bad. We all have blood on our hands. So if you're a monster, we're all monsters.
JACK: No, you don't… Every time I try and do something good, people get hurt. I thought I was getting better. I'm not… I don't know what I am, but I know I can't make the world a better place, not like this. I can't even do one good thing. And I know that if I stay, I'm gonna hurt you. All of you. And… I can't. You're all I have.
SAM: Jack, listen…
JACK: I have to go.
CASTIEL: No, Jack.
JACK: I'm sorry.
[Jack uses his power to knock Sam, Dean, and Cas backward across the war room. His eyes glow golden.]
JACK: I'm so sorry.
[Jack disappears with a woosh]
CASTIEL: Jack.
SAM: Hey.
[Sam and Cas get to their feet and look around for Jack]
CASTIEL: Jack!
SAM: He's gone.
