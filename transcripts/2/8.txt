INT. SALOON - NIGHT (1938)

Robert Johnson is seated on a small stage, playing. His head is down, and a cigarette dangles from his mouth. The room is sparsely populated with people listening intently. One WOMAN near the front stares at him, smiling as if the show is just for her, and occasionally he looks up and catches her eye.

He hears the growling of a dog, outside. He pauses, then resumes. Again, he stops, hearing eerie barking that nobody else seems to notice, and seeing a dark shape flitting past the window. The cigarette falls from his mouth; he is terrified. He stands, clutching his guitar, and bolts from the room in terror. The WOMAN and several others follow.



EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT

ROBERT stops, listening for the dog. He hears it, drops the guitar, and runs to:

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

ROBERT runs into a wooden house and bolts the door behind him. He hears the scrabbling and barking of the dog and draws a chair across the floor, wedging it under the door. He backs up slowly, then sinks to his knees, weeping. The door rattles violently until it flies open; two men and the WOMAN from earlier enter to find ROBERT on the floor, convulsing.

OLD MAN
What is going on?

WOMAN
Oh my God!

(She goes to ROBERT, runs her hands over him.)
Get a doctor. Run!

The OLD MAN runs. The WOMAN leans over ROBERT, patting his face.

WOMAN
What happened? Talk to me!

ROBERT
Dogs...

WOMAN
Stay with us, baby!

ROBERT
Dogs... Black dogs...

WOMAN
Robert? Robert, don't you die on me!

SUPERNATURAL

INT. DINER - DAY (PRESENT)

SAM and DEAN are sitting at a table, SAM with his laptop open. Onscreen is a mugshot of DEAN from the St. Louis Police Department.

SAM
So much for our low profile. You've got a warrant in St. Louis, and now you're officially in the Fed's database.

DEAN
(grinning)
Dude, I'm like Dillinger or something.

SAM
Dean, it's not funny. Makes the job harder, we've gotta be more careful now.

DEAN
Well, what do they got on you?

SAM
(mutters)
I'm sure they just haven't posted it yet.

DEAN
No accessory? Nothing?

SAM
Shut up.

DEAN
(laughing)
You're jealous.

SAM
No, I'm not!

DEAN
Uh-huh. All right. What do you got on the case there, you innocent, harmless young man, you?

SAM shuts his computer, annoyed, and pulls out several pages of research.

SAM
Architect Sean Boyden plummeted to his death from the roof of his home, a condominium he designed.

DEAN
Hmm. Build a high-rise and jump off the top of it. That's classy. When did he call animal control?

SAM
Two days earlier.

DEAN
Did he actually say Black Dog?

SAM
Yeah. A vicious, wild, black dog. The authorities couldn't find it, no one else saw it; in fact, the authorities are a little confused as to how a wild dog could get past the doorman, take the elevator up and start roaming the halls of the cushiest joint in town. After that, no more calls, he doesn't show up for work, two days later he takes a swan dive.

DEAN
Do you think we're dealing with an actual Black Dog?

SAM
Well, maybe.

DEAN
What's the lore on it?

SAM
(passing DEAN the pages)
it's all pretty vague. I mean, there are spectral black dogs all over the world, but... some say they're animal spirits, others say death omens. But anyways, whatever they are, they're big, nasty,

DEAN
Yeah, I bet they could hump the crap outta your leg, look at that one, huh?
(he holds up a picture and smirks; Sam glares; the smirk slips)
What? They could.


INT. APARTMENT - DAY

In a posh, well-lit room, SAM and DEAN are wearing suits and interviewing a man.

SAM
So, you and Sean Boyden were business partners for almost ten years, right?

MAN
That's right. Now one more time, this is for...?

DEAN
A tribute to Mr. Boyden. Architectural Digest.
(The MAN laughs.)
This funny to you?

MAN
No, it... it's just, a tribute. Yeah. See, Sean always got the tributes. He kills himself, leaves me and his family behind... well, he gets another tribute.

SAM
Right. Any idea why he'd do such a thing?

MAN
I, I have no clue, I mean he lived a charmed life.

SAM
How so?

MAN
He was a flat-out genius. I mean, I'm capable, but next to him, I... and it wasn't always that way, either.

DEAN
No?

MAN
You wanna know the truth? There was a time where he couldn't even design a pup tent. Hell, ten years ago he's working as a bartender at this place called Lloyds. A complete dive.

SAM
Right. So what changed?

MAN
You got me. But overnight, he gets this huge commission, and he starts designing... he starts designing the most ingenious buildings anyone has ever seen. It was like, the level of Van Gogh, and Mozart...
(he cuts off abruptly)

DEAN
What?

MAN
It's funny. True geniuses, they seem to die young, don't they? To have that kind of talent? Why... why just throw it away?



EXT. STREET - DAY

DEAN exits a building designated ANIMAL PROTECTION AGENCY, still wearing the suit. SAM is waiting in the car. DEAN gets in the driver's side.

SAM
So.

DEAN
Secretary's name is Carly. She's twenty three, she, uh, kayaks, and they're real.

SAM
You didn't happen to ask her if she's seen any black dogs lately, did you?

DEAN
(holding up a page)
Every complaint called in this week about anything big, black, or dog-like. There's nineteen calls in all. And, uh,
(pulling off a Post-it note)
I don't know what this thing is.

SAM takes it, reads it, and laughs. He glances at DEAN

SAM
You mean Carly's MySpace address?

DEAN
Yeah, MySpace, what the hell is that?
(SAM laughs again)
Seriously, is that like some sort of porn site?



EXT. DR. PEARLMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

DEAN and SAM approach (yet another) white suburban door and knock.

DEAN
I swear, if this is another freakin' Pomeranian barking in the neighbor's yard...

The door opens to reveal a young woman.

DEAN
Afternoon, ma'am.
(pulling out an ID)
Uh, Animal Control.

WOMAN
Oh, someone already came yesterday.

SAM
Oh, we're just following up. We're looking for Dr. Sylvia Pearlman?



INT. DR. PEARLMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

WOMAN
The Doctor, well, she, I don't know exactly when she'll be back, she left two days ago.

SAM
Okay. And you are...?

WOMAN
I'm Ms. Pearlman's maid.

DEAN
So where did the Doctor go?

WOMAN
I'm not sure. She just packed and went, she didn't say where. That stray dog, did you find it finally?

SAM
Oh, not yet. You know, you didn't ever happen to see the dog yourself, did you?

WOMAN
Well, no. I never even heard it.

In the background, DEAN takes a photograph off the wall: it shows DR. PEARLMAN at a bar with two friends.

WOMAN (cont.)
I was almost starting to think the Doctor was imagining things, but she's not like that, so...

DEAN
Hey, you know I read she was, uh chief surgeon at the hospital. She's gotta be what, forty two, forty three? That's pretty young for that job.

WOMAN
Youngest in the history of the place. She got the position... ten years ago?

DEAN
Huh.

SAM
Huh. An overnight success. Ten years ago.

DEAN
Yeah, we know a guy like that. Oh, look at this.
(he holds up the photo, flips it over to show writing on the back)
Lloyd's Bar.



INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

In a rumpled hotel room with red curtains and sheets, a forty-something woman (DR. PEARLMAN) huddles on the bed. Her hair is frazzled and she is terrified, flinching at the slightest noise and hugging her arms around herself. She stands, pacing.

DR. PEARLMAN
Oh god.

She hears a loud pounding at the door. She whirls to face it, frozen.

MAN
(outside the door)
Ms. Pearlman? I've been calling for hours. You need to vacate the room or you gotta pay for another night!

She opens the door and pokes her head out.

DR. PEARLMAN
Okay. No problem.

She goes to the bed and opens her wallet, pulling out some cash. As she turns back to the door, she sees the man's face stretch hideously, mouth opening wide and eyes rolling back in his head. She gasps, tosses the money down at his feet, shuts the door and chains it. She leans against it, panting.



EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

DEAN and SAM pull up outside LLOYD'S BAR and get out. As they walk towards the bar, DEAN notices some yellow flowers growing by the side of the road. He stops.

DEAN
Hey.

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
That's weird.

Pan up to reveal the crossroads; on more than one corner, the yellow flowers are growing.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Think someone planted these?

SAM
Middle of all these weeds?

DEAN
These are, uh, what do you call 'em.

SAM
Yarrow flowers?

DEAN
Yeah. Used for certain rituals, aren't they?

SAM
Yeah, actually. Summoning rituals.

DEAN
Heh. So, two people become sudden successes about ten years ago. Right around the time they were hanging out here at Lloyd's.

SAM
Where there just happens to be a crossroads. You think?

DEAN
Let's find out.

He walks to the center of the crossroads and looks around, measuring.

DEAN
This seem about the dead center to you?

DEAN digs a few inches into the hard soil and hits something solid. He stops.

DEAN
Yahtzee.

He drops the shovel and digs with his hands, pulling out an old rusted box. He opens it. It contains, among other things, several small bones and a small stoppered jar that SAM takes out.

SAM
I'd be willing to bet that's graveyard dirt. And a black cat bone.

DEAN
That's serious spellwork. I mean, that's Deep South Hoodoo stuff.

SAM
Used to summon a demon.

DEAN
Not just summon one. Crossroads are where pacts are made. These people are actually making deals with the damn thing. You know, 'cause that always ends good.

SAM
They're seeing dogs, all right. But not Black Dogs, they're seeing Hellhounds. Demonic pit bulls.

DEAN
Yeah, whoever this demon is, it's back and it's collecting. And that doctor lady? Wherever she's running? She ain't running fast enough.



INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

Inside DR. PEARLMAN'S hotel room, the door is rattling violently. She crouches by the window, screaming. The rattling stops and she gets up warily. Suddenly something invisible bursts through the window, knocking her to the ground. She scrabbles backwards along the floor, away from the scratching and growling; something (still invisible) with sharp claws grabs her leg and shreds it, leaving bloody trails. She's pulled across the floor, grasping at the bed sheets and screaming.



ACT TWO
LOCATION TITLE:
ROSEDALE, MISSISSIPPI
1930


EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

Robert Johnson's "Crossroad Blues" plays in the soundtrack as the man himself kneels in the dust at the dead center of the crossroads. He buries a rough sack tied with a string. He wears a hat and a brown blazer and has a guitar slung around his back. He stands. Suddenly behind him is a beautiful young woman in a white dress; he turns and sees her.

ROBERT
Holy...

DEMON
Holy?
(her eyes burn red)
Guess again.

She walks slowly towards him on bare feet.

ROBERT
I want to play guitar. I want you to make me the best blues man ever lived.

She places a hand gently on his cheek.

DEMON
If that's what you want.

He nods. She smiles.

ROBERT
So... how do we... do we shake on it?

She shakes her head, still smiling, and pulls him in for a deep kiss. When she pulls back, his eyes are closed for a moment. He opens them slowly, and he is alone. He pulls his guitar into his hands and caresses it.



EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY (PRESENT)

SAM
So it's just like the Robert Johnson legend, right? I mean, selling your soul at the crossroads, kind of deal?

DEAN
Yeah, except that wasn't a legend. I mean, you know his music.
(SAM shrugs)
You don't know Robert Johnson's songs? Sam, there's, there's occult references all over his lyrics, I mean, Crossroad Blues? Me and the Devil Blues? Hellhound on My Trail?
(SAM frowns, and DEAN rolls his eyes. )
The story goes, he died choking on his own blood, he was hallucinating, and muttering about big evil dogs.

SAM
And now it's happening all over again.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
We've gotta figure out if anyone else struck any bargains around here.

DEAN
Great. So we've gotta clean up these peoples' mess for 'em? I mean, they're not exactly squeaky clean. Nobody put a gun to their head and forced 'em to play Let's Make A Deal.

SAM
So what, we should just leave them to die?

DEAN
Somebody goes over Niagara in a barrel, you gonna jump in and try to save 'em?

SAM
Dean.

DEAN
All right. Fine.
(beat)
Rituals like this, you've got to put your own photo into the mix, right? So this guy probably summoned this thing, let's go and see if anyone inside knows him. If he's still alive.



INT. DARROW HOME - DAY

SAM and DEAN are walking up a set of wide, wooden stairs to the fourth floor of an apartment building.

SAM
What's this guy's name again?

DEAN
George Darrow. Apparently quite the regular at Lloyd's. Though this house probably ain't up next on MTV Cribs, is it?

SAM
Yeah. So whatever kind of deal he made,

DEAN
Wasn't for cash. Oh, who knows. Maybe this place is full of babes in Princess Leia bikinis.
(SAM sighs)
No, I'm just saying, this guy's got one epic bill come due. Hope at least he asked for something fun.

They reach the landing and stop in front of apartment 4C. The floor is dusted with a fine black powder.

SAM
Look at that.

They crouch down, fingering it.

DEAN
What is that, pepper?

The door opens to reveal GEORGE - a middle-aged man with graying hair, wearing a grimy t-shirt and open button-down.

GEORGE
Who the hell are you?

DEAN
George Darrow?

GEORGE
I'm not buying anything.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, looks like you went for the wrong shaker there. Heh. Usually when you want to keep something evil out you go for the salt.

GEORGE
I don't know what you talkin' about.

DEAN
Talkin' about this.
(he holds up the small picture)
Tell me. You seen that Hellhound yet?

SAM
Look. We want to help. Please. Just five minutes.



INT. GEORGE'S APT - DAY

GEORGE shows them in and pours himself a glass of whisky. The studio apartment is filled with paintings, completed and half-finished, and a table holds painting supplies.

SAM
So what is that stuff out front?

GEORGE
Goofer Dust.
(They look at him blankly)
What, you boys think you know somethin' about somethin' but not Goofer dust?

He tosses DEAN a brown sack, tied close with twine. He catches it.

DEAN
Well, we know a little about a lot of things. Just enough to make us dangerous.

SAM
What is it?

GEORGE
Hoodoo. My grandma taught me. Keeps out demons.

DEAN
Demons we know.

GEORGE
Well, then. Maybe it'll do you some good.
(He walks over to a chair)
Four minutes left.

DEAN glances at SAM, who takes the lead.

SAM
Mr. Darrow. We know you're in trouble.

DEAN
Yeah, that you got yourself into.

SAM
(half-directed at DEAN)
But it's not hopeless, all right? There's gotta be something we can do.

GEORGE
Listen. I get that you boys want to help. But sometimes a person makes their bed, they've just got to lie down in it. I'm the one called that demon in the first place.

DEAN
What'd you do it for?

GEORGE
I was weak. I mean, who don't want to be great? Who don't want their life to mean something? I just... I just never thought about the price.

DEAN
Was it worth it?

GEORGE
Hell no. 'Course, I asked for talent. Shoulda gone for fame. I'm still broke, and lonely. Just now I got this pile of paintings don't nobody want. But that wasn't the worst.

SAM
Go on.

GEORGE
Demon didn't leave. I never counted on that. After our deal was done the damn thing stayed at Lloyd's for a week. Just chattin'. Makin' more deals. I tried to warn folks, but, I mean who's goin' to listen to an old drunk?

SAM
How many others are there?

GEORGE
Uh, the architect, that doctor lady — I kept up with them, they've been in the papers. Least they got famous.

DEAN
Who else, George? Come on, think.

GEORGE
One more. Uh, nice guy too. Hudson. Evan, I think. I don't know what he asked for. Don't matter now. We done for.

SAM
No. No, there's gotta be a way.

GEORGE
You don't get it! I don't want a way!

SAM
Look, you don't -

GEORGE
I called that thing! I brought it on myself. I brought it on them. I'm going to hell, one way or another. All I want is to finish my last painting. Day or two, I'm done. I'm just trying to hold them off 'till then. Buy a little time. Okay, boys. Time you went, go help somebody that wants help.

SAM
We can't just —

GEORGE
Get out! I got work to do.

SAM
You don't really want to die.

GEORGE
I don't? I'm... I'm tired.

They leave as GEORGE starts painting.



INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

EVAN HUDSON is working at his computer when he hears a familiar loud barking outside his window. He stands and pulls back the curtain, peering out. His wife JULIE enters.

JULIE
Evan? You spying on the neighbors?

EVAN
No, I uh, I thought i heard something in the yard, but it's nothing. You all ready to go?

JULIE
You know, if I didn't know better I'd say you want me out of the house.

EVAN
Of course not. It's just, you, you've barely seen your sister since she had the baby.

JULIE
Well, what are you going to do all weekend?

EVAN
Um, not much, I, I got some bills to pay.
(He turns and looks at her sadly, crosses the room to take her in his arms.)
Come here. I'll miss you.

JULIE
You'd better.

EVAN
You know I love you, right? Forever.

JULIE
Of course — Evan, are you okay?

EVAN
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Now get going.

He kisses her again.

JULIE
Okay, I'll call you when I get there.
(she goes to the door, stops and turns back)
Hey, sweetie?

Suddenly her face twists horribly, her skin going gray and cracked, eyes white. Evan recoils; she returns to normal.

JULIE
I love you too.



END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM approach EVAN'S front door. SAM knocks. A moment later, EVAN opens the door.

EVAN
Yes?

SAM
Evan Hudson?

DEAN
You ever been to a bar called Lloyd's? Would have been about ten years ago.

Terrified, EVAN slams the door and latches it.

DEAN
Come on, we're not demons!

INSIDE, EVAN bolts into a back room.

SAM
Any other bright ideas?

DEAN steps back, sets himself, then kicks the door down in one go. They enter. Outside the back room EVAN has just entered, DEAN prepares to kick down that door too. SAM catches his leg, stopping him.

SAM
What —

Looking at DEAN pointedly, SAM turns the handle and pushes the door open gently. The room is quiet. as they enter.

SAM
Evan?

EVAN
(jumping out from behind a bookshelf)
Please! Don't hurt me.

SAM
(holding his hand out, pacifying)

We're not going to hurt you, all right? We're here to help you.

DEAN
We know all about the genius deal you made.

EVAN
What? How?

SAM
Doesn't matter. All that matters is, we're trying to stop it.

EVAN
How do I know you're not lying?

DEAN
Well, you don't, but you're kinda running low on options there, buddy-boy.

EVAN swallows and starts pacing.

EVAN
Can you stop it?

SAM
Don't know. We'll try.

EVAN
I don't want to die.

DEAN
Of course you don't, not now.

SAM
(quietly)
Dean. Stop.

DEAN
What'd you ask for anyway, Evan? Huh? Never need Viagra? Bowl a perfect game? What?

EVAN
My wife.

DEAN
(laughs)
Right. Gettin' the girl. Well, that's worth a trip to hell for.

SAM
Dean, stop.

EVAN
No. He's right, I made the deal. Nobody twisted my arm, that... woman, or whatever she was, at the bar? She said I could have anything I wanted. I thought she was nuts at first, but... I don't know how to— I was desperate.

SAM
Desperate?

EVAN
Julie was dying.

DEAN
You did it to save her?

EVAN
She had cancer, they'd stopped treatment, they were moving her into hospice, they kept saying... a matter of days. So yeah, I made the deal. And I'd do it again. I'd have died for her on the spot.

DEAN
Did you ever think about her in all this?

EVAN
I did this for her.

DEAN
(advancing on him)
You sure about that? I think you did it for yourself. So you wouldn't have to live without her. But guess what? She's going to have to live without you now. But what if she knew how much it cost? What if she knew it cost your soul? How do you think she'd feel?

SAM
(putting a hand on DEAN'S chest, pulling him back)
Okay, that's enough. You just sit tight, all right? We're going to figure this out.

He follows DEAN into the hallway.

SAM
You all right?

DEAN
Yeah, why wouldn't I be? Hey, I got an idea.
(he pulls out the Goofer dust)
You throw George's hoodoo at that Hellhound, keep it away from Evan as long as you can. I'm gonna go to the crossroads and summon the demon.

SAM
Summon— are you nuts?

DEAN
Maybe a little. But I can trap it. I can exorcise it, and I can buy us time to figure out something more permanent.

SAM
Yeah, but how much time?

DEAN
I don't know, a while. I mean, it's not easy for those suckers to claw their way back from hell and into the sunshine.

SAM
No. No way.

DEAN
You're not allowed to say no, Sammy, not unless you've got a better idea.

SAM
Dean, you can forget it, all right? I'm not letting you summon that demon.

DEAN
Why not?

SAM
Because I don't like where your head is at right now, that's why not.

DEAN
What are you talking about?

SAM
You know, you've been on edge ever since we found that crossroads, Dean, and I think I know why.

DEAN
We don't have time for this.

He brushes past SAM, but is stopped by a single word.

SAM
Dad. You think maybe Dad made one of these deals, huh? Hell. I've been thinking it. I'm sure you've been thinking it too.

DEAN
(quietly)
It fits, doesn't it? I'm alive, Dad's dead. The yellow-eyed demon was involved. What if he did? What if he struck a deal? My life for his soul?

EVAN (inside)
I think I hear it! It's outside!

DEAN
Just keep him alive, okay?

SAM
Dean...

DEAN
Go!



EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

DEAN is placing a photo of himself in GEORGE'S box of Hoodoo Magic. He buries dead center at the crossroads, scraping the dirt over it with his hands. As he stands, a beautiful young woman in a black dress appears behind him.

DEMON
So. What brings a guy like you to a place like this?
(He looks at her appraisingly)
You called me?

DEAN
I'm just glad it worked.

DEMON
First time?

DEAN
You could say that.

DEMON
Oh, come on now. Don't sell yourself short. I know all about you, Dean Winchester.

Her eyes glow red for a moment.

DEAN
So, you know who I am.

DEMON
I get the newsletter.

DEAN
Well, don't keep me in suspense. What have you heard?

DEMON
Well, I heard you were handsome, but ... you're just edible. What can I do for you, Dean?

DEAN
Maybe we should do this in my car. Nice and private.

DEMON
Sounds good to me.

They stroll to DEAN'S car.



INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

SAM is sprinkling the dust in a line before the windows, then starts making a circle of it around EVAN, who stands in the middle of the room.

EVAN
What is that stuff?

SAM
Goofer dust.

EVAN
You serious?

SAM
Yeah. 'Fraid so. Look. Believe me, don't believe me, whatever you want. Just whatever you do, stay inside the circle, all right?

EVAN nods.



EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

DEAN and the DEMON are still strolling towards the IMPALA.

DEAN
So I was hoping we could strike a deal.

DEMON
That's what I do.

DEAN
I want Evan Hudson released from his contract.

DEMON
Hmm. So sorry, darling. That's not negotiable.

DEAN
I'll make it worth your while.

DEMON
Oh really? What are you offering?

DEAN
Me.

DEMON
Well, well, well. You'd sacrifice your life for someone else's. Like father, like son.

DEAN eyes her warily.



INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

EVAN is hugging himself, standing in the middle of the circle that SAM is just finishing. He shakes the bag to get out the last grains.

SAM
That's the last of it.



EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

DEMON
You did know about your dad's deal, right? His life for yours? Oh, I didn't make the deal myself, but... boy, I wish I had.

DEAN grits his teeth and opens the passenger side door.

DEAN
After you.

DEMON
Such a gentleman.

As she starts to get into the car, she looks down and sees the edge of a symbol extending from below the car.

DEMON
A Devil's Trap? You've got to be kidding me.



INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

EVAN whirls around at an unheard sound.

SAM
What?

(Dog growling.)

EVAN
You hear that?

SAM
No, where?

He hears the demonic growling.

EVAN
Right outside the door.

The doors begin to rattle violently; Sam steps inside the circle.



END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

Side by side inside the circle of dust, EVAN and SAM stare tensely at the rattling door.

SAM
Just don't move, all right? Stay where you are.



EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

DEMON
You stupid, stupid... I should rip you limb from limb.

She slams the car door shut and advances on DEAN, who backs up towards a wooden structure.

DEAN
(more pleading than defiant)
Take your best shot.

DEMON
No. I don't think so. I'm not going to put you out of your misery.

DEAN
Yeah? Why not?

DEMON
Because your misery's the whole point. It's too much fun to watch. Knowing how your daddy died for you, how he sold his soul. I mean, that's gotta hurt.
(DEAN is backed up against a wooden railing)
It's all you ever think about. You wake up and your first thought is, "I can't do this anymore." You're all lit up with pain. I mean, you loved him so much. And it's all your fault.
(DEAN recoils as she gets more in his face.)
You blew it, Dean! I could have given you what you need.

DEAN
What do I need?

DEMON
Your father. I could have brought him back. Your loss. Seeya, Dean. I wish you a nice long life.

DEAN
Hold on.

She stops, smiling.



INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

The rattling becomes louder, more violent, then stops suddenly.

SAM
Do you still hear it?

EVAN
No. Is it over?

A rumbling sound comes from a grating by the wall. They both whirl to stare at it; it bursts outward, kicking dust into the room.

EVAN
It's here!



EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

The DEMON stops and turns back; DEAN is standing beneath the wooden structure, head down.

DEMON
You're lucky I've got a soft spot for lost puppies and long faces. I just can't leave you like this. Besides. You didn't call me here to bargain for Evan. Not really.

DEAN
Can you bring him back? My dad?

DEMON
Of course I can. Just as he was. Your dad would live a long and natural life, like he was meant to. That's a promise.

DEAN
What about me?

DEMON
I could give you ten years. Ten long good years with him. That's a lifetime. The family can be together again. John, Dean, Sammy. The Winchester boys all reunited.
(she advances towards him)
Look. Your dad's supposed to be alive. You're supposed to be dead. So we'll just set things straight, put things back in their natural order. And you get ten extra years on top. That's a bonus.

She's very close to him; he turns and walks farther back.

DEAN
You think you could... (he turns to face her) ... throw in a set of steak knives?

DEMON
(taking a few steps forward)
You know, this smart-ass self-defense mechanism of yours...

She stops and looks up. Above her head, on the ceiling of the wooden structure, is a Devil's Trap. She glares at him.

DEMON
Dean!

DEAN
Now you're really trapped. That's gotta hurt.

DEMON
Let me out. Now.

DEAN
Sure. We just gotta make a little deal here first. You call off your Hellhounds and let Evan go. Then I'll let you go.

DEMON
I can't break a binding contract.

DEAN
Hmm. And by "can't" you mean "don't want to"? Last chance. Evan and his wife get to live to a ripe old age. Going, going...

DEMON
Let's talk about this.

DEAN
Okay, gone.

He circles around her, pulling out Dad's Journal.



INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

The barking is growing louder and closer; invisible Hellhounds surround SAM and EVAN.

SAM
No! Back inside the circle!

Deep claw marks are gouged into the floor in a path towards the circle; they stop just before the edge.



EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

DEAN has opened the JOURNAL; he holds a rosary in one hand.

DEMON
What are you doing?

DEAN
Oh, you're just gonna go on a little trip. Way down South.

DEMON
Forget Evan. Think of your dad.

DEAN
Regna terrae, cantate Deo...

DEAN continues the exorcism, circling the DEMON, who begins to flinch and convulse; intercut we see SAM and EVAN backing away slowly, wind starting to eat away at their protective circle.



INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

Over DEAN'S continued exorcism, we see SAM and EVAN backing away slowly, wind starting to eat away at their protective circle.

SAM
Circle's broken. Come on!

He pulls EVAN out of the room and down the hall. Quick cuts between DEAN'S exorcism and their frantic escape, DEAN'S voice continuing over it all. SAM and EVAN dart into a storeroom and slam the door behind them. SAM braces himself against it and the Hellhounds start to pound it down.



EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

DEAN
... in potentis Magnife!

DEMON
Wait!



INT. HUDSON HOUSE - NIGHT

The violent pounding stops; everything goes quiet. SAM and EVAN look around, panting.



EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

DEAN and the DEMON are locked in a passionate kiss. She breaks it; he steps back and blinks.

DEAN
What the hell was that for?

DEMON
Sealing the deal.

DEAN
I usually like to be warned before I'm violated with demon tongue.

DEMON
Evan Hudson is free. He and his wife will live long lives.

DEAN
How do I know you're not lying?

DEMON
My word is my bond.

DEAN
Oh, really?

DEMON
It is when I make a deal. It's the rules. You got what you wanted. Now let me go.

DEAN steps back, glancing up at the Devil's Trap. He fingers the rosary.

DEMON
You're gonna double-cross me? Funny how I'm the trustworthy one.
(DEAN shrugs.)
You know, you renege? Send me to hell? Sooner or later I'm gonna climb out, and skinning Evan Hudson will be the first thing that I do.

DEAN smiles, stashes the rosary away. He climbs up and breaks the protective circle above her head. She steps out.

DEMON
I gotta tell you. You would have never pulled that stunt if you knew.

DEAN
Knew what?

DEMON
Where your dad is. You should have made that deal. See, people talk about hell, but it's just a word. It doesn't even come close to describing the real thing.

DEAN
Shut your mouth, bitch.

DEMON
If you could see your poor daddy? Hear the sounds he makes 'cause he can't even scream?

DEAN
(advancing)
How about I send you back there?

She throws her head back; black ichor pours out of her mouth as she screams. DEAN backs up until he's against the wooden structure again. The DEMON is gone, and the girl who had hosted it slumps to the ground, confused.

GIRL
What... how did I get here?



END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

DEAN is driving down a dark road as SAM broods beside him.

SAM
Demons lie all the time, right? Maybe she was lying.

DEAN
Come on. That really what you think?
(Sam looks down)
How could he do it?

SAM
He did it for you.

DEAN
Exactly. How am I supposed to live with that? You know, the thought of him... wherever he is right now. I mean, he spent his whole life chasing that... yellow-eyed son of a bitch. He should have gone out fighting. That was supposed to be his legacy. You know? Not bargaining with the damn thing. Not this.

SAM
How many people do you think Dad saved? Total?

DEAN
That's not the point, Sam.

SAM
Evan Hudson is safe because of what Dad taught us. That's his legacy, Dean. But we're still here, man. So we gotta keep going, for him.
(beat)
Dean?

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
(nervously)
When you were trapping that demon, you weren't... I mean, it was all a trick, right? You never considered actually making that deal, right?

DEAN stares straight ahead, then glances out the window. He reaches forward and turns the radio on full blast and doesn't say a word. SAM flinches.
