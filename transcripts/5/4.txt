OUTSIDE HOTEL
EXT. CENTURY HOTEL – NIGHT

A RELIGIOUS MAN stands outside the hotel with a handful of pamphlets. He addresses a PASSERBY while the Impala drives up.

RELIGIOUS MAN
Hi. Good evening, brother. Is your soul rapture-ready?

The PASSERBY ignores him.

RELIGIOUS MAN
Thank you, sir. God bless.

The RELIGIOUS MAN addresses TWO PASSERSBY while the Impala stops in front of the hotel.

RELIGIOUS MAN
Good evening, folks. Is your soul rapture-ready? Because what I'd like to do is just show you exactly what God's love is for you.

The TWO PASSERSBY ignore him.

RELIGIOUS MAN
Okay, God bless.

DEAN gets out of the Impala and heads for the hotel. The RELIGIOUS MAN addresses him.

RELIGIOUS MAN
Excuse me, friend, but have you taken time out to think about God's plan for you?

DEAN stops and looks at him.

DEAN
Too friggin' much, pal.

DEAN enters the hotel. The RELIGIOUS MAN watches him go.

PHONE CONVERSATION 1
INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT and EXT. ROAD – NIGHT, alternating

DEAN and CASTIEL are on the phone.

DEAN
We're talking about the Colt, right? I mean, as in the Colt?

CASTIEL
We are.

DEAN
Well, that doesn't make any sense. I mean, why would the demons keep a gun around that, uh, kills demons?

A car goes by CASTIEL.

CASTIEL
What? What? Did—I didn't—I didn't get that.

DEAN laughs.

DEAN
You know, it's kind of funny. Talking to a messenger of God on a cellphone. It's, you know, like watching a Hell's Angel ride a moped.

CASTIEL
This isn't funny, Dean. The voice says I'm almost out of minutes.

DEAN
Okay, all right. I'm—I'm telling you, Cas, the mooks have melted down the gun by now.

CASTIEL
Well, I hear differently. And if it's true and if you are still set on the insane task of killing the devil, this is how we do it.

DEAN
Okay. Where do we start?

CASTIEL
Where are you now?

DEAN
Kansas City.

DEAN leans across the bed to grab his room key off the bedside table.

DEAN
Century Hotel, room 113.

CASTIEL
I'll be there immediately.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, come on, man. I just drove like sixteen hours straight, okay? I'm human. And there's stuff I got to do.

CASTIEL
What stuff?

DEAN
Eat, for example. In this case, sleep. I just need like four hours once in a while, okay?

CASTIEL
Yes.

DEAN
Okay, so, you can pop in tomorrow morning.

CASTIEL
Yes. I'll just—

DEAN hangs up. CASTIEL hears a dial tone.

CASTIEL
—wait here, then.

CASTIEL stands at the side of the road.

PHONE CONVERSATION 2
INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN is in bed. His phone vibrates; he answers it.

DEAN
Damn it, Cas, I need to sleep!

SAM
Dean, it's me.

DEAN
Sam? It's quarter past four.

SAM
This is important.

INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT and INT. CAR – NIGHT, alternating

DEAN gets a beer out of the fridge. SAM is driving.

DEAN
So, you're his vessel, huh? Lucifer's wearing you to the prom?

SAM
That's what he said.

DEAN
Just when you thought you were out, they pull you back in, huh, Sammy?

SAM
So, that's it? That's your response?

DEAN
What are you looking for?

SAM
I don't know. A—a little panic? Maybe?

DEAN
I guess I'm a little numb to the earth-shattering revelations at this point.

SAM
What are we gonna do about it?

DEAN
What do you want to do about it?

SAM
I want back in, for starters.

DEAN
Sam—

SAM
I mean it. I am sick of being a puppet to these sons of bitches. I'm gonna hunt him down, Dean.

DEAN
Oh, so, we're back to revenge, then, are we? Yeah, 'cause that worked out so well last time.

SAM
Not revenge. Redemption.

DEAN
So, what, you're just gonna walk back in and we're gonna be the dynamic duo again?

SAM
Look, Dean, I can do this. I can. I'm gonna prove it to you.

DEAN
Look, Sam—it doesn't matter—whatever we do. I mean, it turns out that you and me, we're the, uh, the fire and the oil of the Armageddon. You know, on that basis alone, we should just pick a hemisphere. Stay away from each other for good.

SAM
Dean, it does not have to be like this. We can fight it.

DEAN
Yeah, you're right. We can. But not together. We're not stronger when we're together, Sam. I think we're weaker. Because whatever we have between us—love, family, whatever it is—they are always gonna use it against us. And you know that. Yeah, we're better off apart. We got a better chance of dodging Lucifer and Michael and this whole damn thing, if we just go our own ways.

SAM
Dean, don't do this.

DEAN
Bye, Sam.

DEAN hangs up.

MORNING
INT. HOTEL ROOM – DAY

The nightstand clock is smashed; when DEAN answered his phone it was fine. DEAN is lying on the springs of the hotel bed; the mattress is gone. DEAN gets up and looks around; the entire room is trashed. He looks out the window; so is the city.

ACT ONE
DESTROYED CITY
EXT. DESTROYED CITY – DAY

"THE END"

DEAN leaves the hotel and takes a look around; the area is devastated, everything broken or graffitied on or both.

The first sign of life DEAN sees is a GIRL in an alley with a teddy bear. DEAN approaches her slowly.

DEAN
Little girl? Little girl?

Executive Producer

DEAN
Are you hurt?

Executive Producer
McG

DEAN
You know the not-talking thing is kind of creepy, right?

Blood drips from the GIRL's mouth. The GIRL shrieks and attacks DEAN with a shard of glass. DEAN flattens her and looks around, catching sight of a large piece of graffiti: it reads "CROATOAN".

DEAN
Oh, crap.

Several PEOPLE, all most likely infected with the Croatoan virus the same as the GIRL, come around the corner. DEAN runs. They chase him onto a street blocked by a chain-link fence.

Several SOLDIERS on tanks arrive, shooting the INFECTED PEOPLE. A glass window shatters.

One of the SOLDIERS flicks a switch on an electronic device. The Contours' "Do You Love Me" plays.

MUSIC
Do you love me?

The SOLDIER drinks from a glass bottle.

MUSIC
I can really move

Gunfire. Two INFECTED PEOPLE fall.

MUSIC
Do you love me?

A SOLDIER jumps out of a tank.

MUSIC
I'm in the groove

Several SOLDIERS advance with gunfire.

MUSIC
Do you love me?

More INFECTED PEOPLE fall. DEAN stays under cover and retreats to an alley.

MUSIC
Do you love me now that I can dance? Dance...

More INFECTED PEOPLE fall.

MUSIC
Watch me now

DEAN makes it to the safety of an alley.

MUSIC
Oh work, work, work it all baby

DEAN hotwires a conveniently located, conveniently fueled car.

INT. CAR – NIGHT

DEAN is driving. There is no cell service and only static on the radio.

DEAN
That's never a good sign.

ZACHARIAH
"Croatoan pandemic reaches Australia."

ZACHARIAH has arrived in the shotgun seat, startling DEAN; he reads from a newspaper.

DEAN
I thought I smelled your stink on this Back to the Future crap.

ZACHARIAH
"President Palin defends bombing of Houston." Certainly a buyer's market in real estate. Let's see what's happening in sports. That's right—no more sports. Congress revoked the right to group assembly. What's left of Congress, that is. Hardly a quorum, if you ask me.

DEAN
How did you find me?

ZACHARIAH
Afraid we had to tap some unorthodox resources of late—human informants. We've been making inspirational visits to the fringier Christian groups. They've been given your image, told to keep an eye out.

DEAN
The Bible freak outside the motel—he, what, dropped a dime on me?

ZACHARIAH
Onward, Christian soldiers.

DEAN
Okay, well, good, great. You have had your jollies. Now send me back, you son of a bitch.

ZACHARIAH
Oh, you'll get back—all in good time. We want you to marinate a bit.

DEAN
Marinate?

ZACHARIAH
Three days, Dean. Three days to see where this course of action takes you.

DEAN
What's that supposed to mean?

ZACHARIAH
It means that your choices have consequences. This is what happens to the world if you continue to say "no" to Michael. Have a little look-see.

ZACHARIAH vanishes.

BOBBY'S HOUSE
INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN opens the door to BOBBY's house.

DEAN
Bobby? Bobby, I'm coming in!

DEAN looks around. The place is pretty thoroughly trashed, and from the spiderwebs and dust, no one has been around in a while.

DEAN
Oh, no.

BOBBY's wheelchair is on its side. DEAN sets it upright and sees the bullet holes through and dried blood on the back of the seat.

DEAN
Where is everybody, Bobby?

DEAN opens a hidden compartment and pulls out Bobby's journal. He finds a photo of BOBBY with CASTIEL, three unidentified MEN, and a sign.

DEAN
Camp Chitaqua.

CAMP CHITAQUA
EXT. CAMP CHITAQUA – NIGHT

DEAN approaches the sign from the photo. MEN with guns are just inside the fence, patrolling. DEAN is careful to stay out of sight. He catches sight of the Impala, smashed up and rusted to hell.

DEAN
Oh, baby, no.

DEAN approaches the Impala for a better look at the damage, peering inside the driver's side door.

DEAN
Oh, no, baby, what did they do to you?

DEAN hears something and has barely turned to look when he is knocked out by ANOTHER DEAN, this one 2014!DEAN identified by the military-issue green jacket he is wearing instead of DEAN's blue shirt.

ACT TWO
CAMP CHITAQUA HEADQUARTERS
INT. DEAN'S CABIN – DAY

DEAN wakes up and discovers he is handcuffed to a ladder. 2014!DEAN is across the room cleaning a gun.

DEAN
What the hell?

2014!DEAN
I should be asking that question, don't you think? In fact, why don't you give me one good reason why I shouldn't gank you right here and now?

DEAN
Because you'd only be hurting yourself.

2014!DEAN
Very funny.

DEAN
Look, man—I'm no shapeshifter or demon or anything, okay?

2014!DEAN
Yeah, I know. I did the drill while you were out. Silver, salt, holy water—nothing. But you know what was funny? Was that you had every hidden lockpick, box cutter, and switchblade that I carry. Now, you want to explain that? Oh, and the, uh, resemblance, while you're at it?

Dean
Zachariah.

2014!DEAN stands up.

2014!DEAN
Come again?

Dean
I'm you from the tail end of 2009. Zach plucked me from my bed and threw me five years into the future.

2014!DEAN
Where is he? I want to talk to him.

Dean
I don't know.

2014!DEAN
Oh, you don't know.

DEAN
No, I don't know. Look, I just want to get back to my own friggin' year, okay?

2014!DEAN
Okay. If you're me, then tell me something only I would know.

DEAN thinks, then smirks.

DEAN
Rhonda Hurley. We were, uh, nineteen. She made us try on her panties. They were pink. And satiny. And you know what? We kind of liked it.

2014!DEAN
Touché. So, what, Zach zapped you up here to see how bad it gets?

DEAN
I guess. Croatoan virus, right? That's their endgame?

2014!DEAN
It's efficient, it's incurable, and it's scary as hell. Turns people into monsters. Started hitting the major cities about two years ago. World really went in the crapper after that.

DEAN
What about Sam?

2014!DEAN goes still.

2014!DEAN
Heavyweight showdown in Detroit. From what I understand, Sam didn't make it.

DEAN
You weren't with him?

2014!DEAN
No. No, me and Sam, we haven't talked in—hell, five years.

DEAN
We never tried to find him?

2014!DEAN
We had other people to worry about.

DEAN
Where you going?

2014!DEAN
I got to run an errand.

DEAN
Whoa. You're just gonna leave me here?

2014!DEAN
Yes. I got a camp full of twitchy trauma survivors out there with an apocalypse hanging over their head. The last thing they need to see is a version of The Parent Trap. So, yeah, you stay locked down.

DEAN
Okay. All right. Fine. But you don't have to cuff me, man. Oh, come on. You don't trust yourself?

2014!DEAN
No. Absolutely not.

2014!DEAN leaves.

DEAN
Dick.

DEAN pries a nail out of the floorboards and uses it to remove the handcuffs.

CAMP CHITAQUA
EXT. HEADQUARTERS – DAY

DEAN glances around the camp.

CHUCK
Hey, Dean. You got a second?

DEAN
No—yes. Uh, I—I guess. Hi, Chuck.

CHUCK
Hi. So, uh, listen, we're pretty good on canned goods for now, but we're down to next to nothing on perishables and—and hygiene supplies. People are not gonna be happy about this. So, what do you think we should do?

DEAN
I—I don't know. Maybe, uh, share? You know, like at a kibbutz.

CHUCK
Wait a minute. aren't you supposed to be out on a mission right now?

Dean
Absolutely. And I will be.

CHUCK
Uh-oh.

A WOMAN comes up behind Dean and tries to slug him.

DEAN
Whoa! Jeez! Easy, lady!

DEAN ducks and hides behind CHUCK.

CHUCK
Risa.

DEAN
Risa?

RISA
You spent the night in Jane's cabin last night, didn't you?

DEAN
Uh, what? I—I don't—did I?

CHUCK nods.

RISA
I thought we had a 'connection'.

RISA air-quotes the word.

DEAN
Well, I'm sure that we do.

RISA
Yeah?

CHUCK
Hi, Risa.

RISA
Screw you.

DEAN
Oh, jeez. I'm getting busted for stuff I haven't even done yet.

CHUCK
What?

DEAN
Uh, never mind. Hey, Chuck, is...Cas still here?

CHUCK
Yeah. I don't think Cas is going anywhere.

DEAN enters another cabin.

CASTIEL'S CABIN
INT. 2014!CASTIEL'S ROOM – DAY

2014!CASTIEL is sitting in a circle with several WOMEN.

2014!CASTIEL
So, in this way. We're each a fragment of total perception—just, uh, one compartment in that dragonfly eye of group mind. Now, the key to this total, shared perception—it's, um, it's surprisingly physical.

2014!CASTIEL spots DEAN.

2014!CASTIEL
Oh. Excuse me, ladies. I think I need to confer with our fearless leader for a minute. Why not go get washed up for the orgy?

The WOMEN leave.

2014!CASTIEL
You're all so beautiful.

2014!CASTIEL stands and stretches his back, grunting.

DEAN
What are you, a hippie?

2014!CASTIEL
I thought you'd gotten over trying to label me.

DEAN
Cas, we got to talk.

2014!CASTIEL
Whoa. Strange.

DEAN
What?

2014!CASTIEL
You...are not you. Not now you, anyway.

DEAN
No! Yeah. Yes, exactly.

2014!CASTIEL
What year are you from?

DEAN
2009.

2014!CASTIEL
Who did this to you? Is it Zachariah?

DEAN
Yes.

2014!CASTIEL
Interesting.

DEAN
Oh, yeah, it's friggin' fascinating. Now. Why don't you strap on your angel wings and fly me back to my page on the calendar?

2014!CASTIEL
I wish I could just, uh, strap on my wings, but I'm sorry, no dice.

DEAN
What, are you stoned?

2014!CASTIEL
Uh, generally, yeah.

DEAN
What happened to you?

2014!CASTIEL
Life.

CAMP CHITAQUA
EXT. CAMP – DAY

A car and a jeep arrive. 2014!DEAN and some SOLDIERS climb out. 2014!DEAN grabs two beers and tosses one to a SOLDIER. They both open the beers and drink. 2014!DEAN draws his gun and points it at that soldier.

DEAN
Hey. Hey! Watch out!

2014!DEAN shoots the SOLDIER. The others look between the two DEANs.

2014!DEAN
Damn it.

2014!DEAN addresses the SOLDIERS.

2014!DEAN
I'm not gonna lie to you. Me and him—It's a pretty messed-up situation we got going. But believe me, when you need to know something, you will know it. Until then, we all have work to do.

HEADQUARTERS
INT. HEADQUARTERS – DAY

2014!DEAN shoves 2009!DEAN into the room and shuts the door behind them.

2014!DEAN
What the hell was that?

DEAN
What the hell was that? You just shot a guy in cold blood.

2014!DEAN
We were in an open quarantine zone. Got ambushed by some Croats on the way out.

DEAN's expression asks for an explanation.

2014!DEAN
Croats. Croatoans. One of them infected Yeager.

DEAN
How do you know?

2014!DEAN
'Cause after a few years of this, I know. I started seeing symptoms about a half an hour ago. Wasn't gonna be long before he flipped. I didn't see the point in troubling a good man with bad news.

DEAN
'Troubling a good man'? You just blew him away in front of your own people. Don't you think that freaked them out a little bit?

2014!DEAN
It's 2014. Plugging some Croat, it's called commonplace. Trading words with my friggin' clone—that might have freaked them out a little.

DEAN
All right, look—

2014!DEAN
No, you look. This isn't your time. It's mine. You don't make the decisions. I do. So, when I say stay in, you stay in.

DEAN
All right, man. I'm sorry. Look, I—I'm not trying to mess you—me—us up here.

2014!DEAN
I know.

2014!DEAN pours two glasses of alcohol.

DEAN
It's just been a really wacky weekend.

2014!DEAN
Tell me about it.

They drink.

DEAN
What was the mission, anyway?

2014!DEAN pulls out a gun; it's the Colt.

DEAN
The Colt?

2014!DEAN
The Colt.

DEAN
Where was it?

2014!DEAN
Everywhere. They've been moving it around. Took me five years, but...I finally got it. And tonight—tonight, I'm gonna kill the devil.

ACT THREE
HEADQUARTERS
INT. HEADQUARTERS – NIGHT

RISA
So, that's it? That's the Colt?

2014!DEAN
If anything can kill Lucifer, this is it.

RISA
Great. Have we got anything that can find Lucifer?

2014!DEAN
Are you okay?

DEAN
Oh, we were in, uh, Jane's cabin last night. And, apparently, we and...Risa have a connection.

2014!DEAN
You want to shut up?

DEAN raises his hands in surrender.

2014!DEAN
We don't have to find Lucifer. We know where he is. The demon that we caught last week, he was one of the big guy's entourage. He knew.

RISA
So, a demon tells you where Satan's gonna be, and you just believe it?

2014!DEAN
Oh, trust me, he wasn't lying.

RISA
And you know this how?

2014!CASTIEL
Our fearless leader, I'm afraid, is all too well schooled in the art of getting to the truth.

DEAN
Torture? Oh, so, we're—we're torturing again.

2014!DEAN looks at DEAN.

DEAN
No, that's—that's good. Classy.

2014!CASTIEL laughs. 2014!DEAN looks at him.

2014!CASTIEL
What? I like past you.

2014!DEAN
Lucifer is here. Now. I know the block and I know the building.

2014!CASTIEL
Oh, good—it's right in the middle of a hot zone.

2014!DEAN
Crawling with Croats, yeah. You saying my plan is reckless?

2014!CASTIEL
Are you saying we, uh, walk in straight up the driveway, past all the demons and the Croats, and we shoot the devil?

2014!DEAN
Yes.

2014!CASTIEL
Okay, if you don't like, uh, 'reckless', I could use 'insouciant', maybe.

2014!DEAN
Are you coming?

2014!CASTIEL sighs.

2014!CASTIEL
Of course. But why is he? I mean, he's you five years ago. If something happens to him, you're gone, right?

2014!DEAN
He's coming.

2014!CASTIEL
Okay. Well, uh. I'll get the grunts moving.

2014!DEAN
We're loaded and on the road by midnight.

2014!CASTIEL
All righty.

2014!CASTIEL and RISA leave.

DEAN
Why are you taking me?

2014!DEAN
Relax. You'll be fine. Zach's looking after you, right?

DEAN
No, that's not what I mean. I want to know what's going on.

2014!DEAN
Yeah, okay. You're coming because I want you to see something. I want you to see our brother.

DEAN
Sam? I thought he was dead.

2014!DEAN:
Sam didn't die in Detroit. He said 'yes'.

DEAN
'Yes'?

A long silence.

DEAN
Wait. You mean—

2014!DEAN
That's right. The big 'yes'. To the devil. Lucifer's wearing him to the prom.

DEAN
Why would he do that?

2014!DEAN
Wish I knew. But now we don't have a choice. It's in him, and it's not getting out. And we've got to kill him, Dean. And you need to see it—the whole damn thing, how bad it gets—so you can do it different.

DEAN
What do you mean?

2014!DEAN
Zach said he was gonna bring you back, right? To oh-nine?

DEAN
Yeah.

2014!DEAN
Well, when you get back home—you say 'yes'. You hear me? Say 'yes' to Michael.

DEAN
That's crazy. If I let him in, then Michael fights the devil. The battle's gonna torch half the planet.

2014!DEAN
Look around you, man. Half the planet's better than no planet, which is what we have now. If I could do it over again, I'd say 'yes' in a heartbeat.

DEAN
So why don't you?

2014!DEAN
I've tried! I've shouted 'yes' till I was blue in the face! The angels aren't listening! They just—left—gave up! It's too late for me, but for you—

DEAN
Oh, no. There's got to be another way.

2014!DEAN
Yeah, that's what I thought. I was cocky. Never actually thought I'd lose. But I was wrong. Dean. I was wrong. I'm begging you. Say yes.

A pause.

2014!DEAN
But you won't. 'Cause I didn't. Because that's just not us, is it?

CAMP CHITAQUA
EXT. CAMP – NIGHT

CHUCK
So, you're really from oh-nine?

DEAN
Yeah, afraid so.

CHUCK
Some free advice? You ever get back there, you hoard toilet paper. You understand me? Hoard it. Hoard it like it's made of gold. 'Cause it is.

DEAN
Thank you, Chuck.

CHUCK
Oh, you'll thank me, all right. Mark my words.

DEAN
I'll see you around.

CHUCK
Yeah. Okay.

DEAN gets in one of the vehicles. They drive off.

ON THE MOVE
INT. OFF ROAD VEHICLE – NIGHT

DEAN is riding shotgun in 2014!CASTIEL's car. 2014!CASTIEL takes some pills.

DEAN
Let me see those.

2014!CASTIEL
You want some?

DEAN
Amphetamines?

2014!CASTIEL
It's the perfect antidote to that absinthe.

DEAN
Mmm. Don't get me wrong, Cas. I, uh. I'm happy that the stick is out of your ass, but—what's going on—w-with the drugs and the orgies and the love-guru crap?

2014!CASTIEL laughs.

DEAN
What's so funny?

2014!CASTIEL
Dean, I'm not an angel anymore.

DEAN
What?

2014!CASTIEL
Yeah, I went mortal.

DEAN
What do you mean? How?

2014!CASTIEL
I think it had something to do with the other angels leaving. But when they bailed, my mojo just kind of— psshhew!—drained away. And now, you know, I'm practically human. I mean, Dean, I'm all but useless. Last year, broke my foot, laid up for two months.

DEAN
Wow.

2014!CASTIEL
Yeah.

DEAN
So, you're human. Well, welcome to the club.

2014!CASTIEL
Thanks. Except I used to belong to a much better club. And now I'm powerless. I'm hapless, I'm hopeless. I mean, why the hell not bury myself in women and decadence, right? It's the end, baby. That's what decadence is for. Why not bang a few gongs before the lights go out? But then that's, that's just how I roll.

HOT ZONE
EXT. HOT ZONE – DAY

DEAN, 2014!DEAN, 2014!CASTIEL, RISA, and other SOLDIERS walk, carrying guns and scanning the area.

EXT. JACKSON COUNTY SANITARIUM – DAY

2014!DEAN
There. Second-floor window. We go in there.

RISA
You sure about this?

2014!DEAN
They'll never see us coming. Trust me. Now, weapons check. We're on the move in five.

DEAN
Hey, uh, me. Can I talk to you for a sec?

2014!DEAN goes to the side with DEAN.

DEAN
Tell me what's going on.

2014!DEAN
What?

DEAN
I know you. You're lying to these people and to me.

2014!DEAN
Is that so.

DEAN
Yeah. See, I know your lying expressions. I've seen them in the mirror. Now, there's something you're not telling us.

2014!DEAN
I don't know what you're talking about.

DEAN
Oh, really? Well, I don't seem to be the only member of your posse with some questions, so, uh, maybe I'll just take my doubts over to them.

2014!DEAN
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

DEAN
What?

2014!DEAN
Take a look around you, man. This place should be white-hot with Croats. Where are they?

DEAN
They cleared a path for us. Which means that this is—

2014!DEAN
A trap. Exactly.

DEAN
Well, then we can't go through the front.

2014!DEAN
Oh, we're not. They are. They're the decoys. You and me, we're going in through the back.

DEAN
You mean you're gonna feed your friends into a meat grinder? Cas, too? You want to use their deaths as a diversion?

2014!DEAN looks away.

DEAN
Oh, man, something is broken in you. You're making decisions that I would never make. I wouldn't sacrifice my friends.

2014!DEAN
You're right. You wouldn't. It's one of the main reasons we're in this mess, actually.

DEAN
These people count on you. They trust you.

2014!DEAN
They trust me to kill the devil and to save the world and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

DEAN
No. Not like this, you're not. I'm not gonna let you.

2014!DEAN
Oh, really?

DEAN
Yeah.

2014!DEAN slugs DEAN.

GARDEN
EXT. JACKSON COUNTY SANITARIUM GARDEN – DAY

DEAN wakes up on the ground. He hears gunfire in the building and runs toward it. Thunder crashes, lightning flashes, and DEAN sees 2014!DEAN on the ground, neck held down by SOMEONE wearing a white shoe. 2014!DEAN opens his eyes and sees DEAN. The SOMEONE shifts his weight; 2014!DEAN's neck audibly breaks. The SOMEONE, DEAN sees, is SAM but not; it must be LUCIFER. He turns around and sees DEAN.

LUCIFER
Oh. Hello, Dean.

ACT FOUR
EXT. JACKSON COUNTY SANITARIUM GARDEN – DAY

DEAN stares at LUCIFER.

LUCIFER
Aren't you a surprise.

Thunder and lightning; LUCIFER is now behind DEAN.

LUCIFER
You've come a long way to see this, haven't you?

DEAN
Well, go ahead. Kill me.

LUCIFER
Kill you?

LUCIFER looks at the corpse of 2014!DEAN.

LUCIFER
Don't you think that would be a little...redundant?

LUCIFER sighs.

LUCIFER
I'm sorry. It must be painful, speaking to me in this—shape. But it had to be your brother. It had to be.

LUCIFER reaches for DEAN's shoulder. DEAN moves back.

LUCIFER
You don't have to be afraid of me, Dean. What do you think I'm going to do?

DEAN
I don't know. Maybe deep-fry the planet?

LUCIFER examines a rose, but turns away.

LUCIFER
Why? Why would I want to destroy this stunning thing? Beautiful in a trillion different ways. The last perfect handiwork of God.

DEAN doesn't answer.

LUCIFER
You ever hear the story of how I fell from grace?

DEAN
Oh, good God, you're not gonna tell me a bedtime story, are you? My stomach's almost out of bile.

LUCIFER
You know why God cast me down? Because I loved him. More than anything. And then God created...

LUCIFER smirks.

LUCIFER
You. The little...hairless apes. And then he asked all of us to bow down before you—to love you, more than him. And I said, "Father, I can't." I said, "These human beings are flawed, murderous." And for that, God had Michael cast me into hell. Now, tell me, does the punishment fit the crime? Especially, when I was right? Look at what six billion of you have done to this thing, and how many of you blame me for it.

DEAN
You're not fooling me, you know that? With this sympathy-for-the-devil crap. I know what you are.

LUCIFER
What am I?

DEAN
You're the same thing, only bigger. The same brand of cockroach I've been squashing my whole life. An ugly, evil, belly-to-the-ground, supernatural piece of crap. The only difference between them and you is the size of your ego.

LUCIFER smiles.

LUCIFER
I like you, Dean. I get what the other angels see in you. Goodbye. We'll meet again soon.

LUCIFER turns to walk away.

DEAN
You better kill me now!

LUCIFER turns back.

LUCIFER
Pardon?

DEAN
You better kill me now. Or I swear, I will find a way to kill you. And I won't stop.

LUCIFER
I know you won't. I know you won't say yes to Michael, either. And I know you won't kill Sam. Whatever you do, you will always end up here. Whatever choices you make, whatever details you alter, we will always end up—here. I win. So, I win.

DEAN
You're wrong.

LUCIFER
See you in five years, Dean.

Thunder and lightning; LUCIFER is gone. DEAN turns around and sees ZACHARIAH behind him, reaching for his forehead with two fingers.

EPILOGUE
HOTEL ROOM
INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT, 2009

DEAN leans against the kitchenette sink. ZACHARIAH stands in front of him.

DEAN
Oh, well, if it isn't the ghost of Christmas screw you.

ZACHARIAH
Enough. Dean, enough. You saw it, right? You saw what happens. You're the only person who can prove the devil wrong. Just say yes.

DEAN
How do I know that this whole thing isn't one of your tricks? Huh? Some angel hocus-pocus?

ZACHARIAH
The time for tricks is over. Give yourself to Michael. Say yes and we can strike. Before Lucifer gets to Sam. Before billions die.

DEAN considers this for a long moment, turning away from ZACHARIAH.

DEAN
Nah.

ZACHARIAH
'Nah'? You telling me you haven't learned your lesson?

DEAN
Oh, I've learned a lesson, all right. Just not the one you wanted to teach.

ZACHARIAH
Well, I'll just have to teach it again! Because I got you now, boy, and I'm never letting you—

DEAN is gone.

ZACHARIAH
Son of a...

ROAD
EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

DEAN turns around and sees CASTIEL.

DEAN
That's pretty nice timing, Cas.

CASTIEL
We had an appointment.

DEAN puts a hand on CASTIEL's shoulder.

DEAN
Don't ever change.

CASTIEL
How did Zachariah find you?

DEAN
Long story. Let's just stay away from Jehovah's Witnesses from now on, okay?

DEAN pulls out his phone.

CASTIEL
What are you doing?

DEAN
Something I should have done in the first place.

BRIDGE
EXT. ROAD BY BRIDGE – DAY

DEAN waits by the Impala. Another car pulls up. SAM gets out. DEAN and SAM approach each other.

DEAN
Sam.

DEAN pulls out Ruby's knife. SAM looks at it nervously. DEAN holds it out to SAM, handle first.

DEAN
If you're serious and you want back in...you should hang on to this. I'm sure you're rusty.

SAM takes the knife. He can't meet DEAN's eyes.

DEAN
Look, man, I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm...whatever I need to be. But I was, uh—wrong.

SAM
What made you change your mind?

DEAN
Long story. The point is...maybe we are each other's Achilles heel. Maybe they'll find a way to use us against each other, I don't know. I just know we're all we've got. More than that. We keep each other human.

SAM
Thank you. Really. Thank you. I won't let you down.

DEAN
Oh, I know it. I mean, you are the second-best hunter on the planet.

SAM nods.

SAM
So, what do we do now?

DEAN
We make our own future.

SAM
Guess we have no choice.
