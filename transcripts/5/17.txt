Act One
EXT. IMPALA, HIGHWAY - NIGHT

SAM
Drive faster, Dean.

DEAN
I can’t! Are you okay?

SAM
Yeah, I’m amazing.

DEAN
You ever seen that many?

SAM
No. No way, not in one place.

DEAN
What the hell?

DEAN
Damn it!

ROB says Enochian exorcism.

DEAN

Well that’s something you don’t see every day.

ROB
You two alright?

DEAN
Peachy.

ROB
Be careful. It’s…dangerous around here.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

ROB
No need to thank us.

DEAN
No, hold up a sec! Who are you?

ROB
We’re the Sacrament Lutheran Militia.

DEAN
I’m sorry—the what?

ROB
I hate to tell you this, but those were demons and this is the Apocalypse. So…buckle up.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

SAM
Looks like we’re in the same line of business.

DEAN
And among colleagues. That’s a police-issued shotgun. That truck is, uh…inspired. Where’d you guys pick up all this crap?

PAUL
You know you pick things up along the way.

DEAN
Guys, come on. This whole corner of the state is nuts with demon omens. We just want to help. That’s all.

SAM
We’re on the same team here. Just talk to us.

ROB
Follow us.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

JANE
Dylan, it’s a church. Headphones off.

DYLAN
Yes, mom.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

PASTOR GIDEON
Who would have thought the Apocalypse could be so romantic? Marriage, family—it’s a blessing. Especially in times like this. So hold on to that.

SAM
Wedding?

SAM scoffs.

SAM

Seriously?

PAUL
Yeah. We’ve had eight so far this week.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

CROWD
Congratulations! Yay!

PASTOR GIDEON
So Rob tells me you boys hunt demons.

SAM
Uh…yes sir.

PASTOR GIDEON
You missed a few.

SAM
Yeah. Tell us about it. Any idea why they’re here?

PASTOR GIDEON shakes his head.

PASTOR GIDEON
They sure seem to like us, though. Follow me, gentlemen.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

DEAN
So you’re a preacher?

PASTOR GIDEON
Not what you expected, huh?

DEAN
Well, dude, you’re packing.

PASTOR GIDEON
Strange times.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

DEAN
Is that a twelve-year-old packing salt rounds?

PASTOR GIDEON
Everybody pitches in.

SAM
So, the whole church?

PASTOR GIDEON
The whole town.

DEAN
A whole town full of hunters. I don’t know whether to run screaming or buy a condo.

PASTOR GIDEON
Well the demons were killing us. We had to do something.

SAM
So why not call the National Guard?

PASTOR GIDEON
We were told not to.

SAM
By who?

PASTOR GIDEON doesn’t answer.

DEAN
Come on, Padre. You’re as locked and loaded as we’ve ever seen. And that exorcism was Enochian. Someone’s telling you something.

PASTOR GIDEON
Look, I’m sorry, I, uh, I can’t discuss it.

LEAH GIDEON
Dad, it’s okay.

PASTOR GIDEON
Leah—

LEAH
It’s Sam and Dean Winchester. They’re safe. I know all about them.

DEAN
You do?

LEAH
Sure. From the angels.

DEAN
The angels. Awesome.

LEAH
Don’t worry. They can’t see you here. The…marks on your ribs, right?

SAM
So you know all about us because angels told you?

LEAH
Yes. Among other things.

DEAN
Like the snappy little exorcism spell.

LEAH
And they show me where the demons are going to be, before it happens. How to fight back.

PASTOR GIDEON
Never been wrong. Not once. She’s very special.

LEAH
Dad…

DEAN
And let me guess. Before you see something, you get a really bad migraine, you see flashing lights?

LEAH
How’d you know?

DEAN
‘Cause you’re not the first prophet we’ve met. But you are the cutest.

PASTOR GIDEON gives DEAN a look.

DEAN
I mean that with total respect, of course.

INT. PAUL’S TAVERN - DAY

CASTIEL’S VOICEMAIL
You have reached the voicemail box of:

CASTIEL
I don’t understand why, why do you want me to say my name?

CASTIEL presses random buttons.

SAM
Cas, hey, uh, it’s me. So we are in Blue Earth, Minnesota, and um, we could use a little help. I…hope you get this.

SAM
Busy night?

PAUL
I’m telling you, since The End started, it’s been like one long last call. That round’s on me.

SAM
Thanks.

DEAN
So, did you get a hold of Cas?

SAM
Yeah, I left him a message. I think. So uh, what’s your theory? Why all of the demon hits?

DEAN
I don’t know. Gank the girl? The prophet, maybe?

SAM shakes his head.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Just these angels are sending these people to do their dirty work.

DEAN
Yeah. And?

SAM
And they could get ripped to shreds.

DEAN
We’re all gonna die, Sam. In like a month—maybe two. I mean it. This is the end of the world, but these people aren’t freaking out. In fact they’re running to the exit in an orderly fashion. I don’t know that that’s such a bad thing.

SAM
Who says they’re all gonna die? What ever happened to us saving them?

Church bells toll, people exit.

DEAN
Something I said?

SAM
Paul. What’s going on?

PAUL
Leah’s had another vision.

SAM
Wanna go to church?

DEAN
You know me—downright pious.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

PASTOR GIDEON
Three miles off Talmadge Road.

LEAH whispers to PASTOR GIDEON.

PASTOR GIDEON
Five miles. There are demons gathered. I…don’t know how many, but a lot. Thank you, Leah. So, who’s going to join me?

ROB
Wouldn’t miss it.

PAUL
Someone’s got to cover Rob’s ass.

DEAN
We’re in, Padre.

PASTOR GIDEON
Thank you. I’d like to offer a prayer. “Our Father in Heaven--

DEAN
Yeah, not so much.

PASTOR GIDEON
Help us to fight in your name. We ask that you protect us from all servants of evil. Guide our hands in defeating them, and deliver us home, safely. Thank you, Amen.

EXT. WOODS – DAY

PASTOR GIDEON directs the crew to battle.

INT. DEMON HOUSE - DAY

DYLAN speaks Enochian exorcism.

PASTOR GIDEON speaks Enochian exorcism.

DYLAN speaks Enochian exorcism.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

SAM sighs.

SAM
I guess that’s what it’s like, huh?

DEAN
What?

SAM
Having backup.

DYLAN
Dean. Sam.

DEAN
Yo.

DYLAN
Hey. So, um, is—is that—is that cool that I get a ride back with you guys?

DEAN
Hey, you’ve saved my ass twice already. One more time, you can drive. Get a beer?

DEAN
Hey, you earned it. Don’t tell your mom.

DYLAN
Oh, believe me—I will not.

DYLAN screams.

DEAN
Dylan!

DYLAN is attacked by a demon and killed.

DEAN
No!

Act Two
EXT. CHURCH - DAY

DEAN
Ma’am, we’re just, um, very sorry.

JANE
You know…this is your fault.

ROB
Jane. Come on.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

PASTOR GIDEON
I wish I knew what to say. But I don’t. I’m so sorry, Jane, Rob. There are no words. Dylan… I don’t know why this happened. I don’t know why any of this is happening. I got no easy answers. But what I do know is—Leah, honey?

LEAH falls and has a seizure.

PASTOR GIDEON
Leah, honey? Honey? It’s okay sweetie. It’s okay.

LEAH
Dad, it’s Dylan.

PASTOR GIDEON
Just rest a minute, huh?

LEAH
No, listen. Dylan’s coming back.

ROB
Jeez.

LEAH
Jane, Rob… It’s going to be okay. You’ll see Dylan again. When the final day comes, Judgement Day, he’ll be resurrected and you’ll be together again. We’ll all be together. With all our loved ones. We’ve been chosen. The angels have chosen us. And we will be given paradise on earth. All we have to do is follow the angels’ commandments.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

SAM
No drinking, no gambling, no premarital sex. Dean, they basically just outlawed ninety percent of your personality.

DEAN
Yeah, well, whatever. When in Rome.

SAM
So, uh…you’re cool with it?

DEAN
I’m not cool. I’m not, not cool. I’m just, look man, I’m not a prophet. We’re not locals. It’s not my call. I’ll catch up with you.

INT. CHURCH OFFICE - DAY

DEAN
This a bad time?

LEAH
In general. Now’s okay.

DEAN
Angel stuff really takes it out of you, huh?

LEAH
Can’t complain. I know you have it worse. So…what’s on your mind, Dean?

DEAN sighs.

DEAN
Don’t take this the wrong way but…are you on the level?

LEAH
About what?

DEAN
About paradise.

LEAH
What about it?

DEAN
I want to know what the angels are telling you. Everything.

LEAH
Well, uh…

DEAN
You can skip the rainbows.

LEAH
There’s gonna be a prize-fight. And…it’s gonna get bad. But after we win—and we will—the planet gets handed over to the chosen. And…it’s finally peaceful. No monsters, no disease, no death. You’re just…with the people you love.

DEAN
Of course, that’s if you can get past the velvet rope. Must be nice—being chosen.

LEAH
Well, Dean…you’re chosen.

DEAN
Yeah, more like cursed.

LEAH
Must be hard. Being the Vessel of Heaven and having no hope.

INT. PAUL’S TAVERN - DUSK

SAM
Hey. So what happened to, uh, “the Apocalypse is good for business?”

PAUL
Oh yeah, right up until Leah’s angel pals banned the good stuff. Wanna help me kill some inventory?

SAM
Sure.

PAUL
Don’t get me wrong. I grew up here. I love this town, but uh, well, these holy rollers?

SAM
Yeah, yeah, I uh, I noticed you’re not the praying type.

PAUL
Yeah, well, between you and me, neither are half those guys. A couple of months back, they’re all in here, getting wasted, banging the nanny. Now they’re all Warriors of God. Cheers.

SAM
Cheers.

PAUL
Look, there’s sure as hell demons. And maybe there is a God. I don’t know. Fine. But I’m not a hypocrite. I never prayed before and I ain’t starting now. If I go to hell, I’m going honest. How ‘bout you?

SAM
What about me?

PAUL
Not a true believer, I take it.

SAM
I believe, yeah. I do. I’m just. Pretty sure God stopped caring a long time ago.

SAM and PAUL scoff.

INT. GREEN VALLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

DEAN
Where you been?

SAM
Drinkin’.

DEAN
You rebel.

SAM
I’d have had more, um, but it was curfew.

DEAN
Right.

SAM
You hear they shut down the cell towers?

DEAN
No. That’s, uh, news to me.

SAM
Yeah. No cable, internet. Total cut off from the “corruption of the outside world.”

DEAN
Huh.

SAM
Don’t you get it? They’re turning this place into some kind of fundamentalist compound.

DEAN
No, I get it.

SAM
And all you’ve got’s a “hmm?” What’s wrong with you?

DEAN
I get it. I just don’t care.

SAM
What?

DEAN
What difference does it make?

SAM
It makes a hell of a—

SAM
At what point does this become too far for you? Stoning? Poisoned Kool-Aid? The angels are toying with these people!

DEAN
Angel world, angel rules, man.

SAM
And since when is that okay with you?

DEAN
Since the angels’ got the only lifeboats on the Titanic. I mean, who exactly is supposed to come along and save these people? It was supposed to be us, but we can’t do it.

SAM
So what? You wanna, you wanna just want to stop fighting, roll over?

DEAN
I don’t know, maybe.

SAM
Don’t say that.

DEAN
Why not?

SAM
Cause you can’t do this.

DEAN
Actually, I can.

SAM
No you can’t. You can’t do this to me.

SAM
I got one thing, one thing, keeping me going. You think you’re the only one white-knuckling it here, Dean? I can’t count on anyone else. I can’t do this alone.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN
I got to clear my head.

SAM
It’s past curfew. It’s past curfew.

Act Three
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

ELISE
Leah, what’s wrong?

LEAH
Daddy, can I talk to you for a second?

PASTOR GIDEON
Of course.

PASTOR GIDEON
Leah, honey, w-what is it?

LEAH
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. They’re just so angry.

PASTOR GIDEON
Who’s angry?

LEAH
The angels.

PASTOR GIDEON
Why are they angry?

LEAH
They said… They said that we can’t go to paradise.

JANE
What? But we’re doing everything they say!

LEAH
They said they gave clear commandments, but some people aren’t listening.

ROB
Who, Leah?

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

CASTIEL
I got your message. It was long, your message. And I find the sound of your voice grating.

SAM
What’s wrong with you? Are you…drunk?

CASTIEL
No!…Yes.

SAM
What the hell happened to you?

CASTIEL
I found a liquor store.

SAM
And?

CASTIEL
And I drank it. Why’d you call me?

SAM
Whoa. There you go. Easy. Are you okay?

CASTIEL
Don’t ask stupid questions. Tell me what you need.

SAM
T-there have been these—these demon attacks. Massive, right on the edge of town. And we can’t figure out why they’re—

CASTIEL
Any sign of angels?

SAM
Sort of. They’ve been speaking to this prophet.

CASTIEL
Who?

SAM
This girl, Leah Gideon.

CASTIEL
She’s not a prophet.

SAM
I’m pretty sure she is. Visions, headaches—the whole package.

CASTIEL
The names of all the prophets, they’re seared into my brain. Leah Gideon is not one of them.

SAM
Then what is she?

EXT. STRIP MALL – NIGHT

DEAN is walking and hears loud voices and smashing glass.

INT. PAUL’S TAVERN - NIGHT

PASTOR GIDEON
Please, guys, guys, guys!

PAUL
I’m not going to tell you again!

PASTOR GIDEON
Take a breath, both of you!

PAUL
You come onto my property, spouting some kind of crazy—

ROB
Sorry, Paul. There’s no other way!

PAUL
Come on! What country is this, huh?

DEAN
Need a hand, Padre?

PASTOR GIDEON
Just, everybody cool down for a minute!

PAUL
“Cool down,” hmm? My friends are trying to run me out of town. Do you think I should cool down?

ROB
I’m sorry, Paul. It is not our choice.

PAUL
Oh, come on. That’s bull.

ROB
You’ve got to go—for everyone’s sake!

PAUL
We grew up together. I stood up at your wedding!

JANE
Yes, you did. But that was then. And now you’re standing against the flock.

PAUL
That’s not true. I fight with you.

JANE
This is a town of believers, Paul. You are not a believer.

ROB
Don’t make this hard for us.

PAUL
Hard for you? No. This is my home. You want me out of here? You’ll have to drag me out.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don’t want to do this.

ROB
Get out of my—

PASTOR GIDEON
No, no, no.

JANE
No one’s gonna stop me from seeing my son again.

INT. MOTEL - DAY

SAM
We went out looking for—You alright?

DEAN
Yeah. It’s—it’s not my blood. Paul’s dead.

SAM
What?!

DEAN
Jane shot him.

CASTIEL
It’s starting.

DEAN
What’s starting? Where the hell have you been?

CASTIEL
On a bender.

DEAN
Did he—did you say “on a bender?”

SAM
Yeah. He’s still pretty smashed.

CASTIEL
It is not of import. We need to talk about what’s happening here.

DEAN
Well I’m all ears.

SAM
Well, for starters…Leah is not a real prophet.

DEAN
Well, what is she, exactly?

CASTIEL
The whore.

DEAN
Wow. Cas, tell us what you really think.

CASTIEL
She rises when Lucifer walks the earth. “And she shall come, bearing false prophecy.” This creature has the power to take a human’s form, read minds. Book of Revelation calls her “the Whore of Babylon.”

DEAN
Well, that’s catchy.

SAM
The real Leah was probably killed months ago.

DEAN
What about the demons attacking the town?

CASTIEL
They’re under her control.

DEAN
And the Enochian exorcism?

CASTIEL
Fake. It actually means, “you, um, breed with the mouth of a goat.”

CASTIEL
It’s funnier in Enochian.

DEAN
So the demons smoking out—that’s just a con? Why? What’s the endgame?

CASTIEL
What you just saw—innocent blood spilled in God’s name.

SAM
You heard all that heaven talk. She manipulates people.

DEAN
To slaughter and kill and sing preppy little hymns. Awesome.

CASTIEL
Her goal is to condemn as many souls to hell as possible. And it’s…just beginning. She’s well on her way to dragging this whole town into the pit.

DEAN
Alright. So, then, how do we go Pimp of Babylon all over this bitch?

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT – DAY

JANE
I only wanted to…Did I make it worse? Did I make the angels angry?

LEAH
Jane. The angels—they understand.

JANE
They do?

LEAH
What you did was for the greater good.

JANE
Yes. Yes.

LEAH
We all liked Paul. But he was a sinner, and he would have taken us down with him. You saved us.

JANE
Thank you.

PASTOR GIDEON
How can that be okay? She killed him. That sin is so much greater—

LEAH
It’s not a sin to strike down evil.

PASTOR GIDEON
But how can the angels—

LEAH
You always taught me we have to have faith.

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

CASTIEL puts down a wooden stake on the table in front of SAM and DEAN.

CASTIEL
The whore can be killed with that. It’s a stake made from a cypress tree in Babylon.

DEAN
Great. Let’s ventilate her.

CASTIEL
It’s not that easy.

DEAN
‘Course not.

CASTIEL
The whore can only be killed by a true Servant of Heaven.

DEAN
Servant, like…

CASTIEL
Not you. Or me. Sam, of course, is an abomination. We’ll have to find someone else.

INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

LEAH
The angels…I don’t know why they’ve chosen us. But they have. And today…Today, they told me the most important thing yet. Tonight, at midnight…I’m sorry. It’s just that we knew this day would come, and it’s here—the final judgement. Now, we need to do this right. We don’t have much time. They angels said we’re not ready. There are still a few elements that need to be taken care of. Sinners.

CROWD murmurs and looks around at each other.

PASTOR GIDEON (to the crowd)
Now, uh, now, everybody calm down. Just hold on.

PASTOR GIDEON (to LEAH)
Leah, you’re scaring these people.

LEAH
Now, I don’t want us to panic, but we have to hurry.

PASTOR GIDEON (to LEAH)
Stop it.

LEAH
I’ve been given instructions, names.

PASTOR GIDEON (to LEAH)
Wait. Let’s go. What are you doing? Stop it! You’re going to get somebody killed.

LEAH
Let me go. Or the next sinner I name will be you.

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

CASTIEL
Pastor David Gideon.

PASTOR GIDEON
Yeah. Who are you?

CASTIEL
I’m an angel of the Lord.

PASTOR GIDEON
Yeah, sure.

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

PASTOR GIDEON
What the hell was that?

DEAN
Yeah, he wasn’t lying about the angel thing. Have a seat, Padre. We got to have a chat.

PASTOR GIDEON looks at the cypress stake and shakes his head.

PASTOR GIDEON
No. She’s my daughter.

DEAN
I’m sorry, but she’s not. She’s the thing that killed your daughter.

PASTOR GIDEON
That’s impossible.

SAM
But it’s true. And deep down, you know it. Look, we get it—it’s too much. But if you don’t do this, she’s going to kill a lot of people. And damn the rest to hell.

DEAN picks up the stake and holds it out to PASTOR GIDEON.

PASTOR GIDEON
It’s just…Why does it have to be me?

CASTIEL
You’re a Servant of Heaven.

PASTOR GIDEON
And you’re an angel.

CASTIEL
Poor example of one.

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

DEAN closes the trunk of the Impala, walks around the driver’s side, and reaches in an open window. He grabs a bottle of aspirin.

DEAN
Heads up.

DEAN tosses the bottle to CASTIEL.

CASTIEL
How many should I take?

DEAN
You? You should probably just down the whole bottle.

CASTIEL
Thanks.

DEAN
Yeah, don’t mention it. Yeah, I’ve been there. I’m a big expert on deadbeat dads. So…Yeah, I get it. I know how you feel.

CASTIEL
How do you manage it?

DEAN
On a good day, you get to kill a whore.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT

ELISE
Rob, Jane, please! Come on, it’s me! It’s Elise!

JANE
Sorry. Really. But you know we have to do this.

LEAH
We’re putting them in the storage unit.

ELISE
No! No!

CROWD shouts and pushes, trying to get out.

LEAH
Jane, is that everyone?

JANE
Yeah.

LEAH
Okay, then. Get the kerosene.

LEAH
What?

JANE
There are kids in there.

LEAH
The angels named them for a reason. Jane…Your son needs you to do this.

INT. CHURCH OFFICE - NIGHT

LEAH looks into a mirror in the wardrobe and shows her true face.

CASTIEL grabs LEAH and holds her for PASTOR GIDEON.

LEAH
Daddy! Don’t hurt me!

SAM
Gideon, now!

LEAH chants in Enochian, putting a spell on CASTIEL.

LEAH
Pizin noco iad.

CASTIEL
Aah!

LEAH uses a form of telekinesis to push away PASTOR GIDEON, SAM, and DEAN. She runs off while they get up.

SAM
Gideon! Wait! No!

CASTIEL is left groaning on the ground.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT – NIGHT

LEAH
Help me! He’s a demon!

CROWD fights PASTOR GIDEON as he comes in, causing him to lose the cypress stake.

LEAH
Light the kerosene.

DEAN
Come on, come on!

The SINNERS locked in the storage room beg to be let out.

SAM tackles ROB before he can light the kerosene, and then throws the lighter across the room.

LEAH knocks DEAN down with her telekinesis.

DEAN reaches for the cypress stake.

LEAH
Please. Like you’re a servant of Heaven.

JANE
Let me go!

LEAH
This is why my team’s gonna win. You’re the great vessel? You’re pathetic, self-hating, and faithless. It’s the end of the world. And you’re just gonna sit back and watch it happen.

DEAN grabs the stake, punches LEAH, and stakes her.

DEAN
Don’t be so sure, whore.

LEAH’s body shakes and the stake catches on fire. It explodes, leaving a burning hole where it entered her body.

JANE
But…I don’t understand. How are we supposed to get to paradise now?

DEAN
I’m sorry. Pretty sure you’re headed in a different direction.

PASTOR GIDEON attempts to stand. SAM grabs him and helps him up.

SAM
Gotcha.

DEAN
Come on.

EXT. CHURCH BASEMENT’S STAIRS – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM have CASTIEL and PASTOR GIDEON and are helping them walk up the stairs.

SAM
Dean, how did you do that?

DEAN
What?

SAM
Kill her.

DEAN
Long run of luck held out, I guess.

SAM
Last I checked, she could only be ganked by a servant of Heaven.

DEAN
Well, what do you want me to tell you? I saw a shot. I went for it.

SAM and DEAN get PASTOR GIDEON and CASTIEL into the backseat of the Impala.

DEAN
Alright. Here we go.

SAM
Watch your head, now.

SAM
Are you gonna do something stupid?

DEAN
Like what?

SAM
Like Michael stupid.

DEAN
Come on, Sam. Give me a break.

INT. MOTEL – NIGHT

DEAN
How’s the head?

PASTOR GIDEON
I’m seeing double. But that may be the painkillers.

DEAN
You’ll be okay.

PASTOR GIDEON
No.

SAM
Where you going?

DEAN
I’m just gonna grab some clean bandages out of the trunk. Relax.

SAM
There. How’s that?

DEAN starts the Impala and revs the engine. SAM runs out after him while DEAN speeds away.

EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

SAM
Damn it! Dean! DEAN!

Act Four
EXT. HIGHWAY – NIGHT

DEAN is driving alone.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

DEAN knocks. LISA BRAEDEN answers.

LISA
Dean.

DEAN
Hi, Lisa. I didn’t have your number, uh, so…

LISA
No. No, it’s okay. I’m—I’m…just surprised.

DEAN
How’s Ben?

LISA
Good. Good. He’s at baseball.

DEAN
You moved. It’s a…nice house.

LISA
Dean, you didn’t come all the way here to talk about real estate. You alright?

DEAN
No, not really.

LISA
Well, what is it?

DEAN
Look, I have no illusions, okay? I know the life that I live, I know how that’s gonna end for me. Whatever. I’m okay with that. But I wanted you to know…that when I do picture myself happy…it’s with you. And the kid.

LISA
Wow.

DEAN
I mean, you don’t have to say anything.

LISA
No, I…I mean, I know. I know. I want to. Come inside. Let me get you a beer.

DEAN
I wish I could. Take care of yourself, Lisa.

LISA
No, wait, wait! You can’t just drop a bombshell like that and then leave.

DEAN
I know. I’m sorry. But I don’t have a choice.

LISA
Yeah, you do. You do. You can come inside and let me get you a beer. We can talk.

DEAN
Lisa, wait a minute. Things are about to get really bad.

LISA
Like how? Like your kind of bad?

DEAN
Worse. Next few days, the crap you’re gonna see on your TV, it’s gonna be downright trippy. Scary. But I don’t want you to worry, because I’m making arrangements for you and Ben.

LISA
Arrangements?

DEAN
Whatever happens, you’re gonna be okay.

LISA
What do you mean? What are you talking about?

DEAN
The people that I’m gonna see next, they’re not gonna get anything from me without agreeing to a few conditions.

LISA
Just...just come inside. Please. And whatever you’re thinking of doing, don’t do it.

DEAN
I have to.

LISA
Just stay an hour. At least say bye to Ben.

DEAN
It’s better if I don’t.

DEAN kisses LISA.

DEAN
Bye, Lisa.
