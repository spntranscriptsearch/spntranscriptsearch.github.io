TEASER
INTERIOR OF A CHURCH IN MASON CITY, IOWA. A CHURCH BELL TOLLS AS PARISHIONERS PRAY. AS THE PRIEST APPROACHES THE ALTAR A WOMAN ENTERS. SHE’S CRYING AND SHOWS SIGNS OF THE STIGMATA.

FATHER VALDECANTOS: Olivia?

GASPING, OLIVIA SANCHEZ CONTINUES WALKING DOWN THE CHURCH AISLE.

OLIVIA: Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw!

OLIVIA STOPS IN FRONT OF THE PRIEST. THE WHIP CRACKS AGAIN AND OLIVIA CRIES OUT AS SHE DROPS TO HER KNEES.

OLIVIA: Prok yaw-thi...

FATHER VALDECANTOS LOOKS ON AS OLIVIA CONTINUES TO SOB. BLOOD BEGINS TO SLOWLY FLOW FROM HER RIGHT EAR.

OLIVIA: Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw!

FATHER VALDECANTOS RUSHES FORWARD AS OLIVIA COLLAPSES. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK.

TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH. THE CHURCH BELL TOLLS AS TWO PRIESTS WALK DOWN THE AISLE.

SAM: Father Valdecantos?

THE CAMERA TURNS TO SHOW FATHER VALDECANTOS AT THE ALTAR. THE CAMERA THEN PANS BACK TO WHERE SAM AND DEAN ARE STANDING.

SAM: I'm Father Penn of the Dubuque Archdiocese. This is –

DEAN: Father DeNiro.

SAM: We're here to talk about Olivia Sanchez.

FATHER VALDECANTOS LOOKS AT BOTH OF THE BROTHERS A MOMENT BEFORE SPEAKING.

FATHER VALDECANTOS: I'm not talking about that anymore.

FATHER VALDECANTOS TURNS TO WALK AWAY.

DEAN: You sure were chatty with the press and the cops. "Priest Claims Demons Walk Among Us." Boy, that's quite the headline grabber.

FATHER VALDECANTOS STOPS AND TURNS BACK.

FATHER VALDECANTOS: I said I'm not talking about –

DEAN: No, we heard you. Don't care.

FATHER VALDECANTOS: You'll think I'm lying, like my bishop, like everyone. But I knew Olivia. She was a good person. I watched her get flayed alive by some invisible force. That was the devil's work. I've been told the church doesn't want us talking like that anymore – too old fashioned. But I know what I saw.

DEAN: You see any black smoke?

FATHER VALDECANTOS: What?

SAM: We don't think you're lying. We just wanna ask you a few questions, that's all.

FATHER VALDECANTOS: Um...no. No smoke.

What about sulfur? Did you smell, uh, rotten eggs?

FATHER VALDECANTOS: No.

SAM: You told people that she was speaking in tongues?

FATHER VALDECANTOS: Yes. It sounded like Hebrew. Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw.

SAM: Sounds more like Aramaic than Hebrew.

DEAN: Hmm.

FATHER VALDECANTOS: What kind of priests are you?

DEAN: The old-fashioned kind.

DEAN TURNS AND WALKS AWAY.

SAM: Thanks.

THE BROTHERS CONTINUE WALKING DOWN THE CHURCH AISLE.

DEAN: So no sulfur means no demon. You think the padre's right? We talking about Lucifer here?

SAM: Little small-time for him. I don't know. Maybe a rogue angel?

DEAN STOPS AND WATCHES A BOY LIGHTING A CANDLE.

SAM: Dean.

DEAN: Yeah. Uh, I'll make a call.

EXTERIOR DAYLIGHT. DEAN IS TALKING ON THE PHONE AS HE WALKS AROUND THE IMPALA.

DEAN: Wait, wait, wait. What? Are you serious? Yes, Cass, that's weird. It's really, really weird. All right, yeah. Um... Thanks for the heads up.

DEAN HANGS UP THE PHONE AND LOOKS UP TO SEE SAM WALKING TOWARD HIM. DEAN SENDS MARY A TEXT ON HIS CELL PHONE…HI MOM, JUST CHECKING IN. IS MOM STILL OKAY OR WEIRD? SHOULD I CALL YOU MARY? He waits for an answer but none comes.

DEAN: Now I'm a 13-year-old girl.

SAM HANDS DEAN A CUP OF COFFEE.

SAM: Hey. So what's the word? Cass have anything?

DEAN (CLEARING HIS THROAT): Yeah. Uh... Well, good news, uh, there's nothing on angel radio, and Heaven's still on lockdown, so rogue angel is out.

SAM: Bad news?

DEAN: Cass is chumming it up with Crowley.

SAM: Hmm.

DEAN: They're hunting Lucifer together. That's right – one's an angel, one's a demon, and apparently, they solve crimes.

SAM: Are they having any luck?

DEAN: Kind of. So Lucifer, the Lord of Evil, Angel of Light, is now the Master of Butt Rock. He jumped into Vince Vincente.

SAM: The rock star?

DEAN: The douchebag. Guy used to roll with purple hair down to his butt and a spiked codpiece.

SAM: It – it was the '80s.

DEAN: The what?

SAM (CHUCKLES) Uh... It was the '80s.

DEAN: What, are you defending him?

SAM (SIGHING): No, I'm not... I mean, his third album was kind of... not horrible.

DEAN: I hate you so much right now.

SAM: Anyway, he's the Devil now?

DEAN: Well, I mean, he was always kind of the Devil, but, yeah, now it's official.

SAM: Where is he?

DEAN: Rowena blasted him to the bottom of the ocean.

SAM: Why?

DEAN: I don't know. Why do you love Vince Vincente?

SAM: I don't love – Anyways, uh, looked at those words. I was right. They are Aramaic. READS FROM A TABLET. "Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw." It means, "Save me, oh, God."

DEAN: Save me from what?

THE LOOK ON SAM’S FACE SHOWS THAT HE DOESN’T KNOW THE ANSWER.

INTERIOR: A MORGUE. CARL OPENS THE DOOR TO AN EXAM ROOM AND LEADS SAM AND DEAN INSIDE.

CARL: Body's right there, Agents. I can get her prepped to your –

DEAN: That's great, Carl. Uh... We'll take it from here.

CARL: Oh? Okay. Um, but...it's a weird'un. If you guys need anything at all, I'm –

DEAN: We won't. We won't. Thank you.

CARL: Are...you sure? Yep. Oh, okay.

DEAN USHERS CARL OUT OF THE ROOM AND CLOSES THE DOOR.

SAM: Little, uh, tough on Carl, don't you think?

DEAN: Ah, he's a big boy. He can take it.

SAM: You okay?

DEAN: Peachy.

SAM: You sure? 'Cause ever since Mom left, you've been a little, uh... cranky.

DEAN: Cranky, huh?

SAM: Yeah. I mean, to the priest, to Carl. Heck, on the way here, you wouldn't even make a pit stop.

DEAN: So now your tiny bladder is my problem?

SAM: I'm just saying –

DEAN: Olivia Sanchez. The body was found. It had deep cuts on her back as though she'd been whipped. Holes punctured through her hands and her feet, and pinprick wounds around the top of her skull. What's that sound like to you?

SAM: Stigmata.

DEAN: Bingo. Gets weirder.

SAM: How?

DEAN HANDS THE AUTOPSY REPORT TO SAM

SAM (READING): "The victim's skull was filled with a goopy mush."

DEAN: That Carl paints quite a picture, doesn't he? All right. What can do all that?

SAM (SHAKING HIS HEAD): I got nothing.

DEAN: Me neither.

SAM: Well, maybe we should focus more on the case and less on the Dr. Phil crap.

DEAN WALKS TOWARD THE DOOR TO THE EXAM ROOM WITH SAM FOLLOWING. INTERIOR: CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES BUILDING. A MAN IS REMOVING THE SIGN FROM WHAT USED TO BE OLIVIA SANCHEZ’S OFFICE. SAM AND DEAN ARE BEING ESCORTED BY BETH ROBERTS.

BETH: It's just over here. This is – was Olivia's office.

BETH LEADS SAM AND DEAN INTO THE OFFICE.

SAM: So...what is it now?

BETH: ...kinda mine now.

DEAN LOOKS DOWN AT THE LIT CANDLE.

DEAN: So is that yours?

BETH: It's for positive energy. I'm a Wiccan.

DEAN: Cool.

SAM: So how well did you know Olivia?

BETH: She was my boss. Is it true what they're saying, that she, you know... killed herself?

SAM: Well, we're working on that. Um, now the day she died, was Olivia acting strange?

BETH: Not really. I mean... She was getting headaches. Bad ones, like super migraines. But we all knew she was working too hard.

SAM: She have any enemies?

DEAN: Somebody who held a grudge, maybe wanted to do her harm?

BETH: Yeah. I mean, Olivia was great, but this is Child Protective Services. We get threats all the time.

SAM: From who?

BETH: Everyone. You don't make a lot of friends when sometimes what's best for a family is to split them up.

SAM: Right. Um, yeah, can we see Olivia's case files?

BETH: Of course. They're right over here.

EXTERIOR: DAYLIGHT. THE BROTHERS EXIT THE BUILDING WITH SAM HOLDING THE CASE FILES.

DEAN: Well, that was easy.

SAM: What?

DEAN: What? The Wicca'd Witch of the West in there. Little Miss Positive Energy wanted a bigger office, did a little hoodoo... Boom. I say we put a witch-killing cap in her ass, call it a day.

SAM: Yeah, but we checked the church and Olivia's house. We didn't exactly find any hex bags.

DEAN: So she covered her tracks.

SAM: But we're not looking at a witch. I'm not saying it's not Beth.

DEAN OPENS THE TRUNK OF THE IMPALA.

SAM: I'm – I'm just saying we need proof. And look, if it's her, I'll shoot her myself.

DEAN PICKS UP A BOX OF WITCH KILLING BULLETS.

DEAN: Oh, no, no, no, no. No, I'm definitely shooting her.

DEAN CLOSES THE TRUNK. SAM SHAKES HIS HEAD AND SIGHS. THE BROTHERS GET INTO THE IMPALA

EXTERIOR: NIGHT. A DELIVERY BOY PICKS UP PRODUCE AT A LOADING DOCK. HE’S LISTENING TO MUSIC ON HEAD PHONES. THERE’S THE SOUND OF A WHIP CRACKING AND BLOOD APPEARS ON HIS BACK.

RICKY COPELAND: Aah! Oh! Aah! Ah! Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw!

THE WHIP CRACKS AGAIN AND RICKY SCREAMS.

RICKY: Aah!

THE WHIP CRACKS SEVERAL MORE TIMES AS RICKY SCREAMS. HE FALLS TO THE GROUND AS THE MUSIC HE’S BEEN LISTENING TO CONTINUES TO PLAY. THE CAMERA PANS OUT TO SHOW THE SCENE.

ACT TWO
EXTERIOR: DAYLIGHT. AT THE LOADING DOCK. DEAN FINISHES QUESTIONING A MAN AND WALKS OVER TO SAM WHO’S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POLICE TAPE.

DEAN: Coroner says signs of stigmata with a side of scrambled brains, just like Olivia.

SAM: Great.

DEAN: Did you find anything?

SAM: Maybe. Kid delivered groceries all over town, so I checked his route against Olivia's case files.

DEAN: And?

SAM: Got a match.

DEAN (ON THE PHONE): Tell us about the Petersons.

BETH: They're weird.


DEAN: How weird?

BETH: All the way. That family, they're, like, off the charts religious. Old, old Testament. I'm talking no cars, no electricity, no nothing. Kids are homeschooled. Family like that, we try to keep an eye on them, but...

BETH WALKS INTO HER OFFICE AND TAPS THE KEYS CHECKING THE COMPUTER FOR DATA.

SAM: But what, Beth?

BETH: Their oldest, Magda – a few years ago, she got pneumonia, and the family wouldn't let a doctor treat her. They said whatever happened was God's will.

DEAN: What happened?

BETH: She died.

SAM: All right. Um, thank you.

DEAN ENDS THE PHONE CALL AS SAM SHAKES HIS HEAD.

SAM: So?

DEAN: Weird, creepy, off the grid, "Children of the Corn" people? Yeah, I'm in.

DEAN STARTS THE CAR AND DRIVES OFF. THE SCENE SEGUES TO THE IMPALA DRIVING DOWN A ROAD. DEAN TURNS INTO A DRIVEWAY AND PARKS AT A LOCKED GATE WITH A NO TRESPASSING SIGN ON IT. THE BROTHERS GET OUT OF THE IMPALA DRESSED AS CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES WORKERS WEARING SWEATERS.

DEAN: Guess we're walking from here.

DEAN HAS ISSUES GOING OVER THE FENCE BUT EVENTUALLY MAKES IT. SAM JUST WALKS AROUND. THE BROTHERS WALK UP THE DRIVEWAY. THE SEE A POWER POLE DOWN ON THE GROUND NO LONGER CONNECTED.

DEAN: Whoa. When they cut the cord, they really cut the cord.

SAM: Yeah, no kidding.

DEAN: How fast you think their buggy goes? Like, top speed?

SAM: Hey, about yesterday...

DEAN: Oh, all right. Next time you gotta take a leak, I'll pull over.

SAM: I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you and Mom.

DEAN: What about her? What, she took some cash, she took a cellphone she doesn't answer, and she bailed on us.

SAM: I mean, think about what she's going through. After everything, she probably just needs some space. We've been there. We've both had times where we needed time apart.

DEAN: And we both came back.

SAM: You don't think she's going to?

DEAN: I don't know. She hates the way that we were raised. She hates the fact that we're hunters. Maybe she starts walking and she doesn't stop. You know, she obviously has zero interest in keeping this family together.

SAM: Well, you know, sometimes families do better after a little time apart.

DEAN: Yeah, who? The Mansons?

THE BROTHERS WALK UP TO A HOUSE. THERE ARE SOUNDS OF ANIMALS IN THE DISTANCE. A MAN WALKS AROUND THE HOUSE.

ABRAHAM PETERSON: Can I help you?

SAM: Uh, Abraham Peterson? I'm James Morrison. This is my associate Ray Manzarek. Uh, we're your new case workers with Child Protective Services.

ABRAHAM: Pleasure to meet you.

SAM: Pleasure to meet you.

DEAN: Yeah, thought you'd be, uh, you know, long beard, suspenders, big hat.

ABRAHAM (CHUCKLES): We're not that kind of religious.

DEAN: Ah.

INTERIOR: THE PETERSON’S LIVING ROOM.

SAM: Mr. and Mrs. Peterson, we're here because your previous case worker, Olivia Sanchez, has passed away.

THE PETERSON’S ARE SITTING ON A COACH. THEY CROSS THEMSELVES.

ABRAHAM: What happened?

DEAN: We're not sure yet.

SAM: How often did she visit?

ABRAHAM: Every few months.

GAIL PETERSON: We liked her better than the other one – that Beth.

SAM: And what was wrong with Beth?

GAIL: She hated us because of our faith. Olivia Sanchez was a Papist, but... at least she believed in God.

DEAN: Hmm.

GAIL: Do you know God, gentlemen?

DEAN: Oh, yeah. Yeah, we're – we're besties.

ELIJAH PETERSON WALKS INTO THE ROOM AND WHISPERS TO ABRAHAM.

ABRAHAM: Okay. Um...I'm a little embarrassed to ask, but do you think one of you boys might help me with something?

EXTERIOR: DAYLIGHT. A MOTORCYCLE COMES DOWN THE ROAD. IT STEPS WHEN IT COMES LEVEL WITH THE IMPALA. THE MAN CHECKS THE LICENSE PLATE AND MOVES ON.

EXTERIOR: OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. THE BUGGY HAS LOST A WHEEL.

DEAN: So what happens when, uh, stuff like this goes wrong and no one's around to help you?

ELIJAH: Pray harder.

ABRAHAM: See, I'm not good with all this. I was a computer programmer till about five years ago.

DEAN: What made you move out to the middle of nowhere?

ABRAHAM: Oh, the world out there is all distractions. Consumerism, corporations. And the people, if they're not shopping or stuffing their face, they're sitting in front of some screen watching fake people do fake things, while the real world just gets more and more screwed up. Gail and I, we didn't want that for our kids, so... so here we are, sweatin' our butts off.

DEAN: The things you do for family. Hmm.

ELIJAH: It's ready.

ABRAHAM: All right, let's get this wheel on. On three. One, two, three.

TOGETHER THE BUGGY IS RAISED AND THE WHEEL IS PUT ON.

ELIJAH: Okay.

INTERIOR: THE LIVING ROOM. A CLOCK IS CHIMING. SAM LOOKS AT A FAMILY PICTURE.

GAIL: We're out of coffee. Hope lemonade's all right.

GAIL ENTERS THE ROOM WITH TWO GLASSES.

SAM: Oh, yeah. Great. Thank you.

GAIL: Welcome.

SAM MOTIONS WITH THE PICTURE.

SAM: Happy family.

GAIL: No, they weren't. The father was working 80 hours a week to barely pay the mortgage. And what little time he did spend at home, he spent in a bottle. Children were on four different kinds of behavior-enhancing medication and barely spoke. Could text up a storm, though. And the mother, she was the worst. She was so pilled up, she could barely think straight.

SAM: So what happened?

GAIL: God showed them a better way. I was in a car accident. Almost died. Nerves in the lower half of my body are damaged.

SAM: Wow.

GAIL: I saw doctors. No one could stop the pain. Best they could do was give me drugs, which helped for a while.

SAM (WHISPERING) Yeah.

GAIL: But the more I took, the more I needed. And when I didn't get them... And then one night, when things were at their worst, I was... lying in a puddle of my own sick. I heard a voice. It was God's voice. And he said, "Go, live a life of simplicity and humility, and all your pain will be taken away."

SAM: So has the pain gone away?

GAIL: I get by, with His grace.

SAM: Mrs. Peterson, um, what can you tell me about Ricky Copeland?

GAIL: The delivery boy?

SAM: Yeah.

GAIL: Comes by once a week, brings us things we can't grow ourselves. Why?

SAM: Well... He's dead, too.

GAIL: I see.

SAM: You see? That's it?

GAIL: God has a plan for us all.

SAM: So what happened to your daughter, was that God's plan?

GAIL: Yes.

SAM: She didn't have to die. She was sick. If you had taken her to a doctor –

GAIL: God does –

SAM (INTERRUPTING) God doesn't care what kind of life you live. Trust me. And God didn't kill your daughter. You did.

ABRAHAM: Think you boys should go.

THE CAMERA PANS TO SHOW DEAN, ELIJAH, AND ABRAHAM STANDING IN THE HALLWAY.

EXTERIOR: DAYLIGHT. DEAN OPENS THE TRUNK OF THE IMPALA.

DEAN: All right. We're clear on what we gotta do, right?

SAM: Yeah, definitely.

DEAN: What's that for?

SAM: To track down Magda's ghost. What's...

DEAN: Beth. The witch.

SAM: Dean, this isn't a witch.

DEAN: Well, it's not a ghost.

SAM: Those people let their daughter die. She's angry and wants revenge.

DEAN: Yeah, but they're alive. Besides, how – how she getting around town, huh? Ghosts are tied to one place.

SAM: Or – or to a person or to a thing.

DEAN: Oh, you're reaching.

SAM: And you're not? Beth didn't even know the delivery boy.

DEAN: Maybe, maybe not, but I'm gonna find out.

SAM: Look, you didn't spend alone time with that woman. She is disturbed.

DEAN: The family's weird, but they're good people. Look, Beth wanted the better job, she killed to get it. End of story.

SAM: You're wrong.

DEAN: All right, look, you got your ideas, I got mine. You wanna stay here and, uh, scan the farm for EMF, you go right ahead. I'm on Beth.

SAM: Fine. We'll see who's right.

DEAN: Well, you'll see I'm right.

DEAN CLOSES THE TRUNK

SCENE SWITCHES TO FIND GAIL STANDING ON THE PORCH. ABRAHAM AND ELIJAH ARE WALKING SOME HORSES. GAIL WALKS BACK INTO THE HOUSE. BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR SINGING CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM A BASEMENT. A GIRL IS LAYING ON THE FLOOR. HER BACK IS FLAYED AND RAW.

MAGDA PETERSON: ♪ I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy Down in my heart Where? Down in my heart to stay And if the Devil doesn't like it He can sit on a tack Ouch Sit on a tack Ouch And I'm so happy So very happy ♪

ACT THREE
INTERIOR: THE PETERSON HOUSE. GAIL OPENS THE DOOR TO THE BASEMENT AND WALKS DOWN.

GAIL: What did you do?

MAGDA: Nothing. Nothing.

GAIL: Liar. That woman. That boy. You killed them.

MAGDA: What? No.

GAIL SLAPS MAGDA.

GAIL: I have tried to keep the Devil locked away, and you let him out. You couldn't let it rest. And now... Now the Devil is doing his work through you. Confess your sins.

GAIL HANDS A WHIP TO MAGDA.

GAIL: Pray for forgiveness.

MAGDA UNTIES THE BACK OF HER SHIFT TO SHOW THE SCARS FROM PREVIOUS FLAYINGS.

MAGDA: Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw a-rum mayyaw mto 'ad naf-Shaw.

MAGDA PERFORMS SELF-FLAGELLATION.

MAGDA: Tma-'ith bama-'a-ma-ke syawn w-leth a-Thar lma'kum.

MAGDA WHIPS HERSELF AGAIN.

EXTERIOR: DAYLIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. ELIJAH MOVES TOWARD THE BASEMENT WINDOW AND LOOKS INSIDE. WHERE MAGDA HITS HERSELF AGAIN AND CRIES OUT.

MAGDA: Ishthal-hith bmik-ri.

EXTERIOR: THE PETERSON BARN. FLASHLIGHT OUT, SAM STEPS INSIDE HOLDING AN EMF METER. HE HEARS A DOOR CREEK AND HIDES. ABRAHAM AND ELIJAH ENTER.

ABRAHAM: Elijah? What's wrong?

ELIJAH: Mom's with Magda.

ABRAHAM: Your mother's doing God's work. She's hurting her. Son, the Devil's a deceiver. Don't let him sow doubt in you.

A HORSE WHINNIES AND SAM IS SHOWN HIDING IN THE STALL. ABRAHAM: If anyone found out about Magda, they'd come for her.

ABRAHAM GRABS A FEED BUCKET AND HANGS IT IN THE STALL.

ABRAHAM: And if that happened... I love your sister... but you know what she can do. Magda... Magda's our cross to bear.

ABRAHAM AND ELIJAH LEAVE THE BARN. SAM LEAVES THE STALL. HE TAKES HIS PHONE OUT OF HIS POCKET BUT THERE’S NO SIGNAL.

SAM: Come on.

INTERIOR: CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. BETH IS SITTING AT HER DESK. THE CANDLE IS STILL LIT.

DEAN: Working late?

BETH LOOKS UP TO SEE DEAN STANDING IN THE DOOR WAY. HE HIDES A GUN BEHIND HIM.

BETH: Oh. Sorry, Agent, you surprised me.

DEAN: No worries.

BETH: Can I help you?

SMILING, DEAN WALKS INTO THE ROOM.

DEAN: How you liking the new gig?

BETH: I hate it.

DEAN: What?

BETH: Yeah. You make more, but you work more. And if somebody screws up, that's on you. If somebody blows a deadline, that's on you. And if somebody's photocopying their ass in the breakroom, you have to adult and act all mad, even though it's kind of hilarious. Being the boss sucks. I don't know how Olivia did it.

DEAN: I-I thought you wanted this job.

BETH (CHUCKLES) No. Nobody wants this job.

DEAN: Oh.

DEAN TUCKS THE GUN INTO THE BACK OF HIS PANTS.

BETH: So...why are you here?

DEAN: Um...

INTERIOR: BASEMENT OF THE PETERSON HOUSE.

GAIL: Krav lwaw-thi prok yaw-thi.

MAGDA HITS HERSELF AND SOBS.

GAIL: Hekh ksa-gi-uth Ra-chamawch this-tha-kal lwaw-thi.

MAGDA HITS HERSELF. SAM LOOKS INTO THE WINDOW.

GAIL: W-Al this-tha-lak... a-pawch me-'av-dawch. A-Ni yaw-thi sar-hev a-rum 'yawk Li.

MAGDA CRIES WHILE SAM LOOKS ON IN DISGUST.

GAIL: Again. Again!

MAGDA CONTINUES SOBBING AND SHE WHIPS HERSELF.

GAIL: Ra-chamawch this-tha-kal lwaw-thi. Shezev-Ni mba'-Le dvawv-vay.

MAGDA WHIPS HERSELF.

A-Ni yaw-thi a-do-nay a-rum tawv.

SAM’S PHONE BUZZES AND HE TURNS TO GRAB IT. HE MOVES OUT OF SIGHT BEFORE GAIL TURNS TO LOOK AT THE WINDOW. MAGDA CONTINUES TO SOB.

SAM (ANSWERING HIS PHONE): Hey.

DEAN: Beth is not a witch. You were right about the whole ghost thing.

SAM: Listen, Magda is still alive.

DEAN: Wait, what?

SAM: Yes, Magda's not dead. She's alive.

SAM HEARS THE SOUND OF A SHOTGUN COCKING.

DEAN: Sam.

SAM TURNS TO SEE ELIJAH HOLDING A SHOTGUN.

ELIJAH: Don't move.

DEAN (HEARD OVER THE PHONE): Sammy?

SAM: Okay, listen to me. I can help your sister, okay? I just need you to trust me here.

ABRAHAM COMES UP BEHIND SAM, HITS HIM WITH A STICK, AND KNOCKS HIM OUT.

ACT FOUR
EXTERIOR: NIGHT. DEAN EXITS THE CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES BUILDING.

DEAN: Sam? Sammy?

DEAN GETS INTO THE IMPALA AND DRIVES AWAY.

INTERIOR: BASEMENT OF THE PETERSON HOUSE.

MAGDA (HUMMING): Joshua fought the battle of Jericho And the walls came tumbling down♪

SAM AWAKENS TO FIND HIMSELF IN THE BASEMENT FLOOR WITH HIS HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK.

MAGDA: ♪You may talk about your men of Gideon You may talk about your men of... ♪

SAM: Magda?

MAGDA STOPS HUMMING.

SAM: Magda Peterson.

MAGDA: That's not my name. I'm not Magda. I'm the Devil.

SAM: No. No, you're not. You're really not.

MAGDA: He's inside me. I can hear him whispering. He lets me hear what people are thinking. He lets me do things.

SAM: What kind of things? Magda, I'm here... I'm here to help you. Show me. Please.

MAGDA LOOKS AT THE CROSS ON THE WALL. WITH THE POWER OF HER MIND SHE MAKES IT COME OF AWAY FROM THE WALL AND HOVER.

INTERIOR: DINING ROOM OF THE PETERSON HOUSE. SAM’S CELLPHONE RINGS AS THE PETERSON’S STARE AT IT FROM WHERE THEY’RE STANDING.

GAIL: They'll come for us, our children. We need to leave tonight.

INTERIOR: PETERSON’S BASEMENT.

SAM: Magda... You're not the Devil. You're just psychic. There are others out there like you, like – like me. I have powers, too. I'd get these visions sometimes and – and I could move things with my mind.

MAGDA: You can do that?

SAM: Well, no, not anymore, I don't think. But that didn't make me the Devil. It – it – it just made me who I am.

MAGDA: Then you are evil. Mother says I'm evil, 'cause I hurt people.

SAM: Who did you hurt?

MAGDA: I didn't mean it. She was pretty, and she always smiled. And I thought that maybe she could help me. I couldn't talk to her, but I could hear her thoughts. And I thought maybe I could make her hear mine. (Speaking Aramaic) So I prayed. Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw.

OLIVIA (ECHOING MAGDA’S WORDS WHILE IN THE CHURCH) Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw.

MAGDA CRACKS THE WHIP AS OLIVIA REACTS AND SCREAMS. WHILE MAGDA SPEAKS THE SCENE SHOWS OLIVOA WALKING DOWN THE AISLE IN CHURCH.

MAGDA: Tma-'ith bama-'a-ma-ke syawn w-leth a-Thar lma'kum. And I reached out to her... Ishthal-hith bmik-ri ith-char-char 'inki. ...but she never came.

THE SCENE SWITCHES BACK TO THE BASEMENT WHERE MAGDA TALKS AS SHE REMEMBERS.

MAGDA: And I did it again with the delivery boy. Mother says I killed them.

SAM: Magda, that wasn't your fault. You are not the Devil. You're not evil. And it's scary. I-I know it's scary. But you can learn how to control it. You don't ever have to hurt anyone ever again.

THE DOOR OPENS. MAGDA’S CHAINS RATTLE AS SHE TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND. ABRAHAM AND ELIJAH WALK DOWN THE STAIRS. ABRAHAM IS HOLDING THE SHOTGUN.

ELIJAH: It's time for supper.

INTERIOR: THE PETERSON’S DINNING ROOM. THE CLOCK CHIMES AS SAM’S HANDS ARE TIED TO THE BACK OF A CHAIR. GAIL GRABS A POT OF STEW FROM THE SIDEBOARD.

GAIL: Who's hungry?

SAM: Abraham... your daughter needs help.

GAIL BEGINS TO SERVE THE FOOD.

ABRAHAM: What do you think we've been doing all these years?

GAIL: You talk about knowing God, but we know the Devil.

SAM SCOFFS AS GAIL CONTINUES TO SERVE THE FOOD.

GAIL: We've been wrestling with her for years. You have any idea what she's done?

SAM: Those people, but... That wasn't her fault.

GAIL: You think they're the first? Tell him. Tell him.

MAGDA: Before we came here... I wanted a new cellphone, but my mom wouldn't buy me one.

GAIL: We were driving home, and she screamed at me to pull over. And I felt the Devil at my hands. I yanked that wheel right into oncoming traffic. She did this to me. She did this to us. She has taken lives. Don't you understand that by keeping her here, we're protecting you?

SAM: By doing what? Beating the hell out of her?

GAIL: Pain purges sin.

SAM: No, it doesn't. You're wrong. Abraham.

GAIL: It's time.

THE FAMILY BOWS THEIR HEADS IN PRAYER.

ABRAHAM: We thank you for these bountiful gifts. May they nourish our body and soul. And look after each one of us, now and until our dying day. Amen.

GAIL AND ELIJAH: Amen.

ABRAHAM TAKES A BITE OF THE STEW.

ABRAHAM: Mm.

GAIL: Dig in, everyone. Elijah.

ABRAHAM DROPS HIS SPOON AND BEGINS CHOKING.

ELIJAH: Dad?

ABRAHAM CONTINUES CHOKING AND BEGINS TO FOAM AT THE MOUTH.

SAM: Abraham?

ABRAHAM GRABS FOR HIS THROAT. ELIJAH RISES FROM HIS SEAT.

ELIJAH: Dad?

GAIL RISES.

GAIL: Shh.

ABRAHAM CONTINUES TO CHOKE AND THEN FALLS FACE FIRST INTO HIS BOWL OF STEW.

SAM: What did you do?

THE CAMERA PANS TO REVEAL A CAN OF “RAT HELL” USED AS MOUSE BLOCK AND RAT POISON. GAIL SITS BACK DOWN.

GAIL: Eat.

SAM: What did you do?!

GAIL: This is how we will stay together. We will enter Heaven as a family. Eat!

SAM: Elijah, do not eat that. Elijah!

ELIJAH PICKS UP A SPOONFUL OF STEW. GAIL RISES.

ELIJAH: Mom?

GAIL MOVES TO RIGHT NEXT TO ELIJAH.

GAIL: Eat.

SAM: Elijah, do not do it.

GAIL: Eat!

MAGDA (SCREAMS): No!

ELIJAH DROPS THE SPOON. MAGDA STANDS UP.

GAIL: Devil.

DISHES AND BOWLS FLY OFF THE TABLE. GAIL LOOKS DOWN AND REACHES FOR A KNIFE. SHE LUNGES FOR MAGDA.

ELIJAH: No!

ELIJAH IS STABBED AS HE GETS BETWEEN GAIL AND MAGDA. GAIL PULLS THE KNIFE OUT AND ELIJAH FALLS TO THE FLOOR. GAIL LUNGES AT MAGDA WITH THE KNIFE. BUT HER FORWARD MOTION STOPS BEFORE SHE CAN COMPLETE IT.

MAGDA: I'm not the Devil. You are.

SAM TRIES TO GET OUT OF THE CHAIR AS GAIL FIGHTS THE KNIFE THAT IS SLOWLY TURNING IN HER DIRECTION.

SAM: Magda, stop! You don't have to do this. You could control it. Magda, nobody else has to die. Please!

THE KNIFE PAUSES AT GAIL’S CHEST. MAGDA RELEASES CONTROL OF THE KNIFE AND IT FALLS TO THE GROUND.

ACT FIVE

EXTERIOR: DAY. OUTSIDE THE PETERSON HOUSE. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AN AMBULANCE ARE PRESENT. AN EMT CHECKS MAGDA AS GAIL IS WALKED TO A POLICE CAR.

GAIL: She's the Devil! The Devil is among us! She must be cleansed! She is the Devil! Pray for us!

GAIL IS PLACED IN THE POLICE CAR.

DEAN: Sorry I missed all the psycho.

SAM: Hey, you thought our family was crazy.

DEAN: Yeah.

THE POLICE CAR DRIVES AWAY AS MAGDA LOOKS ON.

SAM AND DEAN WALK OVER TO MAGDA.

SAM: Hey, Magda. Are you holding up?

MAGDA: Beth called my aunt in California. I'm gonna be staying with her.

BETH: She has a ranch. Lots of wide open country.

DEAN: Well, that's great. You know, sometimes in order to figure things out, a person needs space.

BETH: Agent, can I talk to you?

DEAN: Yeah, sure.

DEAN AND BETH WALK OFF. SAM SITS DOWN NEXT TO MAGDA.

SAM: Magda, I-I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but...you're gonna be all right. You can do this. You will do this. Just remember, that power... it doesn't control you. You control it.

MAGDA: I know.

SAM: If you ever need anything, anything, call me, okay? I'll be there.

MAGDA LEANS HER HEAD ON SAM’S SHOULDER.

SCENE SWITCHES TO SAM AND DEAN WALKING DOWN THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD THE IMPALA.

DEAN: Think you made the right call back there, letting her go?

SAM: I hope so. I mean, Magda didn't know what she was doing. She had no idea. I think she deserves a second chance. What did Beth want?

DEAN: She gave me her number, her personal number.

SAM: You were gonna shoot her.

DEAN: Yeah, I know. Kinda weird. Kinda hot. Pfft.

THE BROTHERS SPLIT UP TO EITHER SIDE OF THE IMPALA AND REACH FOR THE DOOR HANDLES.

SAM: Hey, um... did you mean what you said back there?

DEAN: Yeah, you were right. This whole mom thing, it's... I mean, we get her back, and then she leaves. I hate it, but I get it. I do. I guess I just...still working through some of that crap. I'll try to be less of a dick about it.

SAM: Deal.

DEANS CELLPHONE CHIMES. DEAN LOOKS DOWN TO SEE TWO TEXTS FROM MARY. HEY DEAN, PHONE DIED, DIDN’T HAVE A CHARGER. THINGS ARE GOOD. I’LL ALWAYS BE MOM. TELL SAM I LOVE YOU BOYS. DEAN SMILES AND LOOKS UP AS HE PUTS THE PHONE IN HIS POCKET.

SAM: What?

DEAN: Nothing.

DEAN OPENS THE DOOR, GETS INTO THE IMPALA AND THEY DRIVE AWAY.

EXTERIOR: NIGHT. THE BUS TO SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA MAKES A STOP TO ALLOW THE PASSENGERS TO TAKE A BREAK.

BUS DRIVER: All right, bathrooms to the right. Soda machines to the left. You have 20 minutes, folks. Then we're off to Cali.

THE PASSENGERS DISEMBARK. MAGDA HEADS TO THE BATHROOMS ALONE. SHE PASSES A MAN KNEELING NEXT TO A MOTORCYCLE. HE STANDS, TAKES OFF HIS HELMET AND FOLLOWS MAGDA. HE PUTS A SILENCER ON HIS GUN AND ENTERS THE BATHROOM AFTER MAGDA. SHE TURNS AS HE ENTERS. THE SOUNDS OF GUNSHOTS ARE HEARD. AS THE DOOR CLOSES MAGDA IS SEEN LAYING ON THE GROUND.

THE MAN WALKS AWAY AND HIS CELLPHONE RINGS.

Man: What's your status?

MR. KETCH: I cleaned up the Winchesters' mess. As suspected, they couldn't finish the job.

MAN: Very well. Thank you, Mr. Ketch.
