EXT. WOODS – NIGHT


100 Mile Wilderness, Maine

One Year Later


A young MAN and WOMAN are asleep in a tent. A bright light appears outside. The woman sits up in alarm and shakes the MAN.


WOMAN
Will, get up. Something just happened.


The light outside disappears. Footsteps approach the tent and a figure walks past.


WOMAN
Go. Go do something.


WILL
W-what are we supposed to...


WILL grabs a flashlight and goes outside the tent.


WILL
Hello? Hello? [He stands for a moment pointing his flashlight into the darkness.] It was a deer. [He turns back to the tent door.] I don't know. It was like – it was a deer or something – [He hears a noise, turns around again and gasps.] Oh!


DEAN, bloodstained and dirty and holding an axe-like weapon, is standing in front of him.


DEAN
Where am I?


WILL
What?


The WOMAN comes out of the tent. DEAN cocks a gun and points it at her and WILL.


WILL
W– hey, hey.


DEAN
Where's the road?


WILL
[pointing] Twelve miles, that way.


Keeping his gun pointed at the couple, DEAN picks up a backpack from the ground and runs off.


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD – DAY


Styx's Man in the Wilderness plays.


Clayton, Louisiana

Four Days Later


An orange pick-up comes to a stop.


♪ Another year has passed me by ♪

♪ Still I look at myself and cry ♪


DEAN gets out and the driver points directions.


♪ What kind of man have I become? ♪


DEAN walks down the road.


♪ All of the years I've spent in search of myself ♪

♪ And I'm still in the dark ♪


DEAN holds his left arm while walking.


♪ 'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone ♪


DEAN holds his left arm again.


♪ Sometimes I feel ♪

♪ Like a man in the wilderness ♪


EXT. NIGHT


A sign on a stone pillar marking someone’s land reads “Lafitte”.


♪ I'm a lonely soldier off to war ♪


DEAN reads the sign and walks onto the land.


♪ Sent away to die ♪

♪ Never quite knowing why ♪

♪ Sometimes it makes no sense at all ♪


DEAN, carrying a shovel and holding his left arm, paces slowly and deliberately from a windmill.


♪ It makes no sense at all ♪


DEAN
This better be you, you son of a bitch.


He starts to dig, grunting as if in pain. The scene then cuts to him throwing the shovel down and hoisting himself up to sit on the edge of the grave he has dug. He holds his left arm.


DEAN
All right.


DEAN stands up and the camera pans to uncovered bones in the grave.


DEAN
Hold on, you bastard. [He rolls up his left sleeve. His forearm is glowing red and pulsing.] Hold on!


DEAN cuts his left arm with a large knife.


DEAN
Anima corpori... [He holds his arm out over the grave and red glowing liquid drips from his arm onto the bones.] Fuerit corpus... totem resurgent.


DEAN groans in pain as light plays over the bones. As the light vanishes, he drops to the ground.


DEAN
Wow.


DEAN rolls down his sleeve, still gasping in pain. A MAN appears behind him.


DEAN
Wow. That was fast.


MAN
No thanks to you. The hell took you so long?


DEAN gets to his feet, holding his arm.


DEAN
You're welcome.


The MAN cracks his neck.


DEAN
Everything working?


MAN
Good enough. [He opens his mouth wide and vampire teeth descend, then retract as he closes his mouth.]


MAN
So... what now?


DEAN
Like we talked about, I guess.


MAN
[nods] Then this is goodbye.


DEAN
Keep your nose clean, Benny. You hear me?


BENNY walks towards DEAN, holding out his hand. They shake.


BENNY
We made it, brother. I can't believe it.


BENNY laughs and pulls DEAN into a hug.


DEAN
You and me both.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT


Kermit, Texas


INT. HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM is packing a bag in a dark bedroom. He pats a dog that is lying on the bed. A woman in the bed opens her eyes and watches SAM leave. SAM pauses briefly in the doorway, then walks on. We hear the front door close.


EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT


The IMPALA pulls out of the driveway. Someone watches from the shadows across the street.


CUT TO: the IMPALA driving down a road.


EXT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


The IMPALA pulls up outside the cabin and SAM gets out.


INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


SAM opens the front door and takes a few steps inside. DEAN pushes SAM to the ground and douses him with holy water.


SAM
What the –? I'm not a demon.


DEAN pours Borax over SAM.


SAM
Or a Leviathan. What –


DEAN grabs SAM’s arm and cuts it with a knife. SAM gasps in pain.


DEAN
Or a shifter. Good. [He stands up.] My turn. Come on. Let's go. [He holds out the bottles to SAM.]


SAM
I don't need to. I know it's you.


DEAN
Damn it, Sammy! [He splashes the holy water and Borax over himself and holds out a knife to SAM, who has stood up.] Come on!


SAM
No! Dean, can I just say hello?


DEAN rolls up his sleeve and cuts his own arm.


DEAN
All right. [He smiles as he binds his arm.] Well... let's do this.


SAM
I don't know whether to give you a hug or take a shower.


DEAN
[laughs] Come here.


DEAN holds out his arms and they hug.


SAM
Dude. You're... freakin' alive. [He walks a few steps away with his hands in his hair.] I mean, what the hell happened?


DEAN
Well, I guess standing too close to exploding Dick sends your ass straight to Purgatory.


SAM
You were in Purgatory? For the whole year?


DEAN
Yeah, time flies when you're running for your life.


SAM
Well, how'd you get out?


DEAN
I guess whoever built that box didn't want me in there any more than I did.


SAM
What does that mean?


DEAN
I'm here, okay?


SAM
What about Cas? Was he there?


DEAN walks a few steps away and speaks with his back to SAM.


DEAN
Yeah, Cas didn't make it.


SAM
What exactly does that mean?


DEAN
Something happened to him down there. Things got pretty hairy towards the end, and he... just let go.


SAM
So Cas is dead? You saw him die?


DEAN
I saw enough.


SAM
So, then what, you're not sure?


DEAN
[turning back to SAM] I said I saw enough, Sam.


SAM
Right. Dean, I'm sorry.


DEAN
Me too. So you – I can't believe you're actually here. [He takes two beers out of the refrigerator.] You know that half your numbers are out of service? Felt like I was leaving messages in the wind. [He sits down at the table and sets a beer down for SAM. SAM remains standing.]


SAM
Yeah, I-I-I didn't get your messages.


DEAN
How come?


SAM
Probably because I ditched the phones.


DEAN
Because...?


SAM
I guess, um... I guess something happened to me this year, too.[He shrugs.] I don't hunt anymore. [He smiles tentatively.]


DEAN
Yeah. And Sasha Grey's gone legit. [SAM exhales.] What?


SAM
Nothing. Um, she did a Soderbergh movie.


DEAN
What?


SAM
She did a Soderbergh –


DEAN
No. You, Sam. You quit?


SAM
Yeah. Yeah, I – you were gone... Dean. Cas was gone, Bobby was dead. I mean, Crowley even shipped off Kevin and Meg to parts unknown.


DEAN
So you just turned tail on the family business.


SAM
Nothing says "family" quite like the whole family being dead.


DEAN
I wasn't dead. [He stands up and walks around SAM.] In fact, I was knee-deep in God's armpit killing monsters, which, I thought, is what we actually do.


SAM
Yes, Dean. And far as I knew, what we do is the thing that got every single member of my family killed. I had no one – no one. And for the first time in my life, I was completely alone. And, honestly, I-I didn't exactly have a roadmap. So, yeah, I-I fixed up the Impala, and I just... drove.


DEAN
After you looked for me. [SAM says nothing.] Did you look for me, Sam? [SAM looks away.] Good. That's good. Now, we – we... always told each other not to look for each other. That's smart. Good for you. Of course, we always ignored that because of our deep, abiding love for each another, but not this time, right, Sammy?


SAM
Look, I'm still the same guy, Dean.


DEAN
Well, bully for you. I'm not.


DEAN walks away and we hear the door close.


SAM
Welcome back.


INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – NIGHT


DEAN is going through a box containing phones.


SAM
You want some dinner?


DEAN
Pass. [He puts an earphone into his ear.]


SAM
Okay. [He stirs something on the stove.]


CUT TO: SAM is at the table eating. DEAN, who had been listening to phone messages through the headset, turns to look hard at him.


SAM
What?


DEAN takes out the earphone and puts the phone on speaker.


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
Sam Winchester, it's Kevin Tran. Crowley had me in this warehouse, and I just escaped. I don't know where I am. And I don't know if he or – or any other demons are still after me. I need your help. Call me back. It's Kevin Tran.


SAM
When was that?


DEAN plays another message.


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
Sam Winchester. It's Kevin Tran. I called you a week ago. Call me, please. I don't know what the hell I'm doing out here, man.


SAM puts down his spoon.


SAM
Okay. [He stands up.] I get it. So, what, you want to... strategize or something?


DEAN plays another message.


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
Sam, it's Kevin. I'm... Whoo! I'm so good.


SAM
Is he...drunk?


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
Three months since you ditched my ass. Haven't slept for more than four hours a night. It's all good in the hood. [clears throat] Uh, if you're still alive, eat me.


DEAN plays another message.


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
Eat me!


DEAN plays another message.


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
Sam, it's been six months. I can only assume you're dead. If not, don't try and reach me. You won't be able to. I won't be calling this number anymore.


DEAN stands up.


DEAN
He was our responsibility. [He tosses the phone at SAM’s chest.] And you couldn't answer the damn phone.


CUT TO: DEAN is reading on the couch. SAM is using his laptop at the table.


SAM
All right, listen to this – Kevin's last message. Listen to the background.


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
If not, don't try and reach me. You won't be able to. I won't be calling this number anymore.


SAM
Hear that?


DEAN
What is it?


SAM
I think he was on a bus. Listen again.


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
If not, don't try and reach me.


PHONE MESSAGE – WOMAN’S VOICE
Last stop – Centreville.


PHONE MESSAGE – KEVIN
...won't be calling this number –


DEAN stands up and walks over to SAM.


DEAN
Centreville? Centreville, where?


SAM
Michigan.


DEAN
And why would Kevin be in Centreville, Michigan?


SAM
Because... [He does an internet search for “Kevin Tran BFF Link”] his high-school girlfriend... [He turns the laptop around to show DEAN a page for CHANNING NGO] goes to college there.


DEAN
That's thin.


SAM
It's the best lead we got.


DEAN
"We"?


SAM
You were right. He was our responsibility. So... let's find him, okay?


EXT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


DEAN and SAM put weapons and their bags into the trunk of the IMPALA.


SAM
Hey. [He tosses DEAN the keys.]


DEAN looks the IMPALA over.


DEAN
Well... no visible signs of douchery – I'll give you that. [He and SAM get in. DEAN pauses and looks at the back seat.] Smell like dog to you?


SAM
[inhales] In the car?


DEAN
You tell me. [SAM shrugs.] Hmm.


DEAN starts the engine and they drive away.


EXT. PALM MOTEL – DAY


DEAN is standing in front of a vending machine. SAM unloads the car and pauses to look at DEAN before he heads towards the room. Two young boys run across the parking lot shooting at each other with toy guns.


BOY 1
Come on, I got you!


BOY 2
No way.


BOY 1
You’re dead!


BOY 2
No way, I’m not dead at all!


DEAN continues to stand in front of the vending machine.


FLASHBACK


DEAN is chasing someone in Purgatory. He loses the trail and stops, then hears a rustling noise and sets off again. The MAN he is chasing stops running and DEAN comes up behind him. The MAN turns with a yell and grapples with DEAN. DEAN hits the MAN’s arm, making him drop his weapon, then pushes him hard against a tree and holds a knife to his throat. The MAN’s teeth descend, revealing that he is a VAMPIRE.


DEAN
Take a breath. Calm down. Where's the angel?


VAMPIRE
You're him. The human.


DEAN
[forcefully] Where's the angel?


VAMPIRE
I don't know.


DEAN
Hmm.


DEAN plunges his knife into the VAMPIRE’s arm, pinning him to the tree. DEAN then picks up the VAMPIRE’s weapon and beheads him with it.


With a yell, a SECOND VAMPIRE tackles DEAN to the ground. DEAN reaches unsuccessfully for the weapon as the SECOND VAMPIRE holds him down. BENNY appears, flings himself at the SECOND VAMPIRE and beheads him. BENNY turns to look at DEAN with his vampire teeth descended.


The flashback ends and we return to the present, where DEAN is still standing in front of the vending machine.


ACT TWO
INT. PALM MOTEL – DAY


DEAN is sitting on the edge of a bed, rubbing his hands together. SAM comes out of the bathroom and leans on the door frame.


SAM
You okay?


DEAN
[looking tense and nervous] Yeah. Yeah, hey, what do you say we blow this joint, hit the road?


SAM
Now?


DEAN
Yeah, Kevin's not getting any more found.


SAM
The kid survived a year without us. He'll be okay for another twelve hours. Besides, when's the last time you slept?


DEAN
Hmm.


SAM
What?


DEAN
Nothing. Is that, uh, that how you rationalized taking a year off? People will be okay?


SAM
People were okay, Dean. You're okay.


DEAN
Wow.


SAM
Look, I did what we promised we'd do. I moved on. I lived my life.


DEAN
Yeah, no, I'm getting that.


SAM
Look, it wasn't like I was... just oblivious. I mean, I read the paper every day. I saw the weird stories… [He sits down on the other bed facing DEAN] …the kind of stuff we used to chase.


DEAN
And you said what? "Not my problem"?


SAM
Yes. And you know what? The world went on.


DEAN
People died, Sam.


SAM
People will always die, Dean. Or maybe another hunter took care of it. I don't know, but the point is, for the first time, I realized that it wasn't only up to me to stop it.


DEAN
Hmm. So what was it, hmm? What could possibly make you stop just like that? A girl? Was there a girl?


SAM
The girl had nothing to do with it.


DEAN
There was a girl.


SAM
Yeah. There was. And then there wasn't. Any more questions?


EXT. PALM MOTEL – NIGHT


INT. PALM MOTEL – NIGHT


SAM is sitting on the edge of one of the beds.


SAM
Listen, I know this is gonna sound crazy to you. I don't even necessarily need you to understand. But...you need to know. I didn't just drop out, Dean. I found something. Something I've... never had all my life.


DEAN is on the floor leaning against the other bed, with his back to SAM.


DEAN
Yeah, what was her name?


SAM
Amelia.


DEAN
So, what, you, uh, you dropped your peanut butter in her chocolate? How'd it happen?


SAM
I hit a dog.


DEAN turns to look at SAM and points a finger at him.


DEAN
I knew I smelled dog.


SAM
And I knew you'd throw a bitch fit.


DEAN
Hey, the rules are simple, Sam. You don't take a joint from a guy named Don, and there's no dogs in the car!


SAM
All right, what about you?


DEAN
What about me?


SAM
Look at you. You've still got that look. You're shaky. You're on edge. What was it like?


DEAN
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.


SAM
Try me.


DEAN
It was bloody. Messy. 31 flavors of bottom-dwelling nasties. Hell, most days felt like 360-degree combat. But there was something about being there.


FLASHBACK – PURGATORY


DEAN is standing, holding the VAMPIRE’s weapon.


DEAN (V-O)
It felt pure.


BENNY retracts his teeth.


BENNY
What, no thanks for saving your hide?


DEAN
Sure. I won't shove this up your ass.


BENNY
Mm. Awful strange way to punch your meal ticket, friend. I got something you need.


DEAN
Yeah, what's that?


BENNY
A way out.


DEAN
[laughs] Even a dental apocalypse [?] like you knows there's no such thing.


BENNY
There is if you're human. God has made it so. At least, that's the rumor.


DEAN
Bull.


BENNY
Suit yourself. Maybe you've gone native. Maybe you like being man meat for every Tom, Dick, and Harry.


DEAN
Prove it.


BENNY
Nah. You're either in or you're out.


DEAN
So you just want to guide me out of Purgatory out of the goodness of your undead heart?


BENNY
More or less.


DEAN
What's in it for you?


BENNY
I'm hopping a ride.


DEAN
What?


BENNY
It's a human portal, jackass. Only humans can pass through. I show you the door, you hump my soul to the other side.


DEAN
So you're looking for a soul train.


BENNY
Sure. If that's what you're into.


DEAN
And how do I know this isn't a set-up? How do I know I ain't gonna end up like your friend over there?


BENNY
He was my friend. Now you are. First rule of Purgatory, kid. You can't trust nobody.


DEAN
You just asked me to trust you.


BENNY
You see? You're getting it now.


DEAN
Hmm. First we find the angel.


BENNY
Mm, three's a crowd, chief.


DEAN
Well, hey. Either you're in or you're out.


INT. PALM MOTEL – NIGHT


The flashback ends and we return to a close-up of DEAN’s face in the motel room.


EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS – DAY


INT. COLLEGE ROOM – DAY


A GIRL is using a laptop. CHANNING NGO is standing.


CHANNING
The last time I saw Kevin was, like, a year ago.


SAM
When he disappeared?


CHANNING
Mm-hmm. He stole his mother's car because he thought he was on a mission from God or something?


SAM and DEAN are wearing suits.


CHANNING
It was crazy.


GIRL
Shut up! My friend Adam – who got addicted to Adderall but got a perfs on his SATs, so it was totally worth it – same thing.


CHANNING
Shut up!


GIRL
Serious. Mission from God.


SAM
[Clears throat] Look, Channing, we know Kevin was here.


CHANNING
No, he wasn't.


SAM
And we understand if you're trying to protect him. But nobody can protect Kevin better than we can.


CHANNING
I hate Kevin. I wouldn't protect him.


DEAN
I thought you two had a thing.


CHANNING
Yeah, when he was going to Princeton.


DEAN
Wow. Just like that?


GIRL
Yeah.


CHANNING
Mm-hmm.


EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS – DAY


DEAN
So why would Kevin come sniffing around here if not to see her?


SAM
No idea. Maybe we should split up, ask around, see if anybody's seen him?


DEAN
Yeah, Asian kid, yea high, at a university. That should be easy.


INT. COLLEGE ROOM – DAY


The GIRL is still using her laptop. CHANNING is sitting at a desk taking something out of a bag.


GIRL
Okay. Are you ready to forget all about what's-his-name? Okay, this guy's name is Kyle, he's Jewish, um, I'm pretty sure he has an Asian thing. Perfs, right?


CHANNING turns around. She is holding a bowl and a dagger. Her eyes turn black.


CHANNING
Shut up, bitch.


GIRL
What?


CHANNING cuts the GIRL’s throat and fills the bowl with her blood.


CHANNING
Inferni clamavi ad te regem sermonos meos. [The blood bubbles and boils.] The Prophet still has not yet shown his face to me. But you should know Dean Winchester is back.


ACT THREE
EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS – DAY


SAM is sitting at an outdoor table using his laptop. A dog barks and SAM looks up to see a woman walking a large brown dog on a leash.


FLASHBACK


INT. RIVER BLUFF VETERINARY HOSPITAL – NIGHT


SAM enters, carrying a dog covered with a bloodstained blanket.


SAM
Help. I need help. The dog needs help.


A nurse, ROBERTA, points to a treatment room.


ROBERTA
That way!


SAM
He just – he just came out of nowhere, right in front of my car. [He lays the dog on the table.] We need a doctor. Are you a doctor?


ROBERTA
The doctor's coming, sir. But I'm not sure –


SAM
You're not sure what? [shouting] This is an animal hospital. You save animals.


ROBERTA
Sir.


SAM
Save this animal!


VET
Roberta, can you escort this gentleman out, please?


The VET is a young woman with long dark hair.


ROBERTA
Yes.


SAM
I did this.


ROBERTA
Come on.


ROBERTA and SAM leave the room. The VET lifts the blanket covering the dog.


EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS – DAY


The flashback ends and we return to SAM sitting at the outdoor table and staring into space. DEAN sits down opposite him.


DEAN
Don't judge me. I got bubkis.


SAM
Well...


A WAITRESS puts a plate of food in front of SAM.


WAITRESS
And here you go.


SAM
Ah, thank you.


SAM pushes the plate towards DEAN.


DEAN
Sweet mother of God. It's for me? Seriously? [He looks very pleased.]


SAM
Check this out. So, I went through campus security archives around the time Kevin should have been here. [DEAN takes a bite of a burger.] Anyone look familiar?


SAM turns the laptop towards DEAN, who is chewing with his eyes closed. The laptop shows security footage of KEVIN wearing a baseball cap.


SAM
Dude. It's a burger.


DEAN
It's a treasure. All right, so, what, Kevin comes all the way to campus and doesn't see his girlfriend?


SAM
I don't know... but I went to the computer lab and found the computer he was on.


DEAN
And?


SAM
And I found the website he was visiting, found his account username, hacked in to the website, found when else this username logged in, and then I reverse-tracked the IP address back to the original user, Kevin, who has apparently been using the same wireless router for the past two months.


DEAN
That is spectacular work. Any chance I can get that in English?


SAM
Yeah. I think he's in Iowa – at a coffee shop. [He shows DEAN the laptop again, this time with a map on the screen.]


EXT. CHURCH – DAY


Fairfield, Iowa


We hear car doors close and SAM and DEAN walk from the IMPALA to the church.


DEAN
A church? You sure this is right?


SAM
Barista at the coffee shop swears he's seen Kevin ducking in here for the past few months. [He tries the door, then knocks.] Kevin. It's Sam and Dean Winchester. Open up.


SAM shakes his head at DEAN and DEAN picks the lock.


INT. CHURCH – DAY


SAM and DEAN enter. KEVIN sprays them with Borax from a large water gun.


DEAN
Stop! Stop! Not Leviathans. It's us.


KEVIN
What the hell happened to you guys?


DEAN
Cliff Notes? I went to Purgatory. Sam hit a dog.


KEVIN
For real? [DEAN wipes his face with his sleeve.] You want some towels?


KEVIN leads the way into the room. Symbols are painted on the floor.


DEAN
Who taught you all this?


KEVIN
I guess... God.


SAM
God taught you how to trap demons?


KEVIN
Technically, yeah.


SAM
Wait, wait, hold on. Crowley kidnapped you. I saw that. But then you left a message saying you escaped. How?


KEVIN
Well...


FLASHBACK


INT.WAREHOUSE – DAY


KEVIN walks up a flight of stairs with a DEMON.


KEVIN (V-O)
First, he took me to a warehouse.


CROWLEY is waiting for them.


CROWLEY
Look at you. Haircut, manicure, pedicure. Like a new penny.


KEVIN
Will there be torture now?


CROWLEY
Torture? Heavens, no. No. Quite the opposite, my young prince. Sky's the limit for you and I.


CROWLEY puts a hand on KEVIN’s shoulder and leads him across the room.


KEVIN (V-O)
There was a tablet there, like the last one.


CROWLEY motions KEVIN into a chair in front of a stone tablet.


CROWLEY
There we go. Now, remember – feel like a winner, be a winner. Okay? Interpret.


INT. CHURCH – DAY


DEAN
Wait, there's another tablet? So another Word of God.


KEVIN
[nods] Yes.


DEAN
How many Words of God are there?


KEVIN
I just became a Prophet, like, a year ago.


SAM
Well, did this tablet have a name?


KEVIN
"Demons."


DEAN
What about demons?


KEVIN
As far as I could tell... everything.


FLASHBACK


INT.WAREHOUSE – DAY


CROWLEY
What are we looking at?


KEVIN
It's all just fragments. Bits and pieces. This is hard.


CROWLEY
Throw me a bone here, Kev.


KEVIN
Wait...


CROWLEY
Yes?


The tablet seems to shake and blur in KEVIN’s hands.


KEVIN
I'm sorry. Is it just me, or is it hot in here?


CROWLEY
Is it? Our mistake. [He mouths “Turn it up” to the DEMON, who nods and leaves.]


KEVIN
Okay. I see something. Hell Gates.


CROWLEY
Talk to me.


INT. CHURCH – DAY


SAM
What about Hell Gates?


KEVIN
There's one in Wisconsin. The tablet told me how to open it. There were ingredients for a spell.


FLASHBACK


INT.WAREHOUSE – DAY


KEVIN is using a mortar and pestle. He adds something to a large bowl. DEMONS bring other ingredients to the table and KEVIN continues to prepare the spell. He looks up and nods to one of the DEMONS, who is on his cell phone.


DEMON (on phone)
Right away.


DEMON (to KEVIN)
Mr. Crowley would like you to proceed.


KEVIN
Where is Mr. Crowley?


DEMON
Where do you think, dumbass? Wisconsin.


KEVIN lights a match and holds it above the bowl.


DEMON
Go.


KEVIN smiles and drops the match.


INT. CHURCH – DAY


DEAN
You showed the King of Hell how to open a Hell Gate? So that all the demons in Hell could come out all at the same time?


KEVIN
What? No.


FLASHBACK


INT.WAREHOUSE – DAY


The match falls into the bowl. Flames flare up and light engulfs the DEMONS, who burn up while being flung backwards into the wall.


EXT.WISCONSON FIELD – DAY


CROWLEY (on phone)
Men?


INT.WAREHOUSE – DAY


KEVIN takes the tablet and runs.


EXT.WISCONSON FIELD – DAY


CROWLEY (on phone)
Kevin? Kevin?


The camera pans out and we see that CROWLEY is surrounded by goats.


INT. CHURCH – DAY


KEVIN
[smiling] I told Crowley I was opening a Hell Gate, but I was reading from another chapter – how to destroy demons.


DEAN
You son of a bitch.


SAM
Wait. Kevin? Where's the tablet now?


KEVIN
Safe.


SAM
Safe where?


DEAN
Hey. As long as it's safe, okay? Were you able to read anything else off the tablet before you stashed it?


KEVIN
Only the stuff about closing the gates of Hell. Forever.


DEAN
Come again?


KEVIN
Banish all demons off the face of the Earth, lock them away forever. That could be important, right?


SAM and DEAN look at each other.


DEAN
Closing the gates of Hell forever? Yeah. Yeah, that could be important.


ACT FOUR
EXT. CHURCH – DAY


DEAN and SAM exit the church and stand talking outside it.


DEAN
Okay, if this kid is right, he's sitting on a bombshell. Hell, he is the bombshell. [SAM looks away.] What?


SAM
That. I mean, there's no way that Kevin's getting out of this intact, is there?


DEAN
Well, he's doing pretty well for himself so far.


SAM
Yeah, he got out.


DEAN
And now he's in it... whether he likes it or not.


SAM
So...free will, that's only for you?


DEAN
I can't believe what I'm hearing. Sam, we have an opportunity to wipe the slate clean. We take Kevin to the tablet, he tells us the spell, we send every demon back to hell – forever. Every single bastard that destroyed our lives, killed our mother, killed Jess. And you're not sure?


INT. CHURCH – NIGHT


SAM walks in and sits in a pew behind KEVIN.


SAM
Kevin, I, uh... I owe you an apology. Um... look, when you disappeared and Dean disappeared, I...needed to clear my head, and... I'm thinking maybe you were one of the pieces that I should have been there to pick up.


KEVIN
You've been a hunter since you were a kid, right?


SAM
Yeah, mostly. Yeah.


KEVIN
Ever since I realized I was a prophet... It's just hard to believe this is actually my life.


SAM
Yeah. It sucks right now. I know that. Um, it might suck for a lot longer, but... trust me on this – it gets better.


KEVIN
[turns to look at SAM] You know I'm not gay, right?


SAM
If we can do this, get the tablet, get you everything you need to close the gates of Hell, there's a world out there where nobody – not Crowley, no demon – is chasing you anymore.


KEVIN
I guess I just don't see how I get from here to there.


SAM
I used to not be able to see it, either. But there is a way.


KEVIN
Just give me five minutes.


KEVIN walks off. DEAN stands in the doorway watching SAM.


FLASHBACK


INT. RIVER BLUFF VETERINARY HOSPITAL – NIGHT


SAM sits in the waiting room, looking down with his hands clasped and jiggling his feet. ROBERTA is behind the counter. The VET comes into the room to talk to him. SAM stands up.


VET
He's sustained some serious internal bleeding. There's at least two leg fractures that I can see right now. But with some TLC, he should pull through for you.


SAM
[sighs in relief] Thanks, Doctor.


VET
You're gonna take the dog?


SAM
Look, I-I would. He's... not mine.


VET
He's not anybody's.


SAM
I-I spend a lot of the time on the road.


VET
Don't you think you're responsible?


SAM
Why do you think I brought him here?


VET
Roberta, could you hand this man his trophy on his way out, please? Well, maybe if you were such an upstanding guy, you wouldn't have hit him in the first place?


SAM
Fine. I'll take him.


VET
There's my hero.


INT. CHURCH – NIGHT


SAM is still sitting in the pew.


EXT. CHURCH – NIGHT


INT. CHURCH – NIGHT


KEVIN is walking into the room to join SAM and DEAN when the church starts to shake. SAM draws DEAN’s attention to the floorboards breaking.


DEAN
We got company. Sam. [He hands SAM a knife and picks up his weapon from Purgatory.]


SAM
What the hell is that?


DEAN
It's Purgatory.


The doors fly open and two DEMONS enter.


DEMON
Dean Winchester. Back from Purgatory.


DEAN
Spanky the demon. [SAM moves to stand in front of KEVIN.] Yeah, I heard about you. You’re the one who uses too much teeth, right?


The DEMONS rush for DEAN and SAM and they fight. KEVIN squirts one of the DEMONS with holy water from a squeeze bottle. SAM kills one of the demons with the knife.


SAM
Dean!


SAM passes the knife to DEAN, who is struggling with the other DEMON. DEAN kills the DEMON with the knife.


CROWLEY
Hello, boys.


CROWLEY and CHANNING are standing in the doorway.


CROWLEY
Dean. You're looking... well, let's just say Purgatory didn't do you any favors. Where's your angel?


DEAN
Ask your mother.


CROWLEY
There's that grade-school zip. Missed it. I really did. [to SAM] Moose. Still with the pork chops. I admire that.


KEVIN
Let Channing go.


DEAN
That's not Channing, Kevin. Not anymore.


CROWLEY
What an awful thing to say to the boy. Of course it's Channing. Kev. Last time we danced, you stole my tablet and killed my men. Tell you what. Come with me now, bygones. And I'll let the girl go back to... What's-the-Point U.


DEAN
He's lying. You won't get Channing back. She's probably dead already.


CROWLEY
[sighs] Will you please stop saying that? Let the girl speak. [He snaps his fingers.]


CHANNING
Kevin?


KEVIN
Channing?


CHANNING
What's going on?


KEVIN
There's a demon in you, and you're going to your safety school.


CHANNING
What?!


KEVIN
But it's gonna be okay.


CROWLEY
I-I-I-I just – I can't.


KEVIN
No, no, wait.


CROWLEY snaps his fingers again and CHANNING’s eyes turn black.


KEVIN
Okay. I'll do it.


SAM
Kevin.


KEVIN
Myself for the girl. But this ends. All right? No fighting, no nothing. It ends.


DEAN
Can't let you do that, buddy.


KEVIN
Or what? You'll kill me? [to CROWLEY] I'll grab my stuff. [He leaves.]


CROWLEY
Chin up, gentlemen. I'm a professional.


DEAN
This ain't over by a long shot, Crowley.


CROWLEY
Really, Dean, who writes your stuff? A marshmallow? [calls out] Come on, Kevin. Chop, chop. [pause] Kevin?


CROWLEY takes a step forward and DEAN raises the knife. CROWLEY snaps his fingers and the knife glows red. DEAN drops it.


DEAN
Aah!


CROWLEY
Ready, boys?


CROWLEY walks past SAM and DEAN.


CROWLEY
Kevin!


DEAN picks up the knife.


CUT TO: CROWLEY, with CHANNING behind him, opens another door in the church. KEVIN is standing in the room holding the end of a cord.


CROWLEY
Kevin.


KEVIN pulls the cord and holy water drops onto CROWLEY and CHANNING. They yell.


KEVIN
[shouting] Sam, Dean, run!


CROWLEY and CHANNING continue to yell and sizzle. SAM, DEAN and KEVIN run for the IMPALA. CROWLEY and CHANNING come outside the church.


CROWLEY
Find another meatsuit.


Black smoke pours from CHANNING’s mouth. We see the IMPALA drive past the church in slow motion. As KEVIN and SAM watch, CROWLEY makes a hand motion and CHANNING’s neck snaps. She falls to the ground. The IMPALA speeds away and CROWLEY wipes his face with a handkerchief.


ACT FIVE
EXT. GAS STATION – DAY


The IMPALA pulls up to the pumps. DEAN’s phone rings.


DEAN (on phone)
Hello? [He listens.] Wrong number. [He hangs up.]


DEAN
Automated jackass. All right, anybody want anything?


SAM
I'm good.


DEAN turns to look at KEVIN in the back seat. KEVIN doesn’t respond. DEAN looks at SAM.


SAM
Kevin? How you holding up?


KEVIN
Awesome. The king of Hell just snapped my girlfriend's neck. How about you?


SAM and DEAN look at each other.


DEAN
All right, listen to me. I'm sorry about your girlfriend, okay? I am. But the sooner you get this, the better. You're in it now, whether you like it or not. That means you do what you got to do. I'm hitting the head.


DEAN gets out of the IMPALA and walks towards the men’s room. He stops and makes a call on his cell phone.


BENNY (on phone, V-O)
There he is.


DEAN (on phone)
How did you get a phone?


EXT. CEMETERY – DAY


BENNY is wearing a dark cap and dark sunglasses. A funeral is in progress around a gravesite behind him. The remainder of the scene alternates between DEAN at the gas station and BENNY in the cemetery.


BENNY (on phone)
Would you believe they sell these things in convenience stores now? A lot's changed in 50 years.


DEAN (on phone)
Must be a hell of a lot to take in.


BENNY (on phone)
Mostly it's the choices, you know? So many choices. [He turns to look at the funeral party.]


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah, I hear that. Listen, Benny, not to beat a dead horse. What we did down there is what we had to do. Now, I don't regret it for a second. But... you know, maybe until we both adjust, it's best we don't talk for a while.


BENNY (on phone)
There it is.


DEAN (on phone)
One day at a time, just like we talked about, right?


BENNY (on phone)
I think you had it right, bud.


DEAN (on phone)
What's that?


BENNY (on phone)
Purgatory was pure. I'm kind of wishin' I had appreciated it more. You know? Like you.


DEAN (on phone)
Listen, you got an emergency, you call me, you understand?


BENNY (on phone)
I hear you. You keep your nose clean, too, brother.


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah.
