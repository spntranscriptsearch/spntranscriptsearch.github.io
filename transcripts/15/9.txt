--NOW--

[Interior, the Lucky Elephant Casino. Sam is restrained in a chair. Eileen sits across from him]

CHUCK: Hi, Sam.

EILEEN: I'm sorry.

SAM: It's not your fault, Eileen. Is it?

EILEEN: What are you doing to me?

CHUCK: Same thing I've been doing for weeks— helping, helping you to the bunker, to Sam... to romance. It was easy, really, just a nudge here, a conveniently placed spell there.

[flashback to 15.06, as Sam remembers finding "Rowena's" spell, and realized Chuck had planted it]

SAM: Wait. That was you?

CHUCK: Uh, it wasn't all me, Sam. I just gave you half the spell. You did the rest all on your own... which I knew you would... [Sam struggles against his restraints as Chuck mills around him]...because you're such a good guy.

SAM: Why?

CHUCK: I couldn't see you. I needed eyes and ears on the inside. Well, eyes, anyway.

EILEEN: Screw you.

CHUCK: Yeah. You know, I hate missing my favorite show.

SAM: So I was right. You're weak.

CHUCK: Well, I wouldn't say "weak," exactly. I mean, I piñata'd Hell. But, yeah, you figured it out – we're connected by these wounds. Which – [Chuckling] annoying, right? And as long as we are, I'm stuck in this world. But you know what they say... ...all good things must come to an end.

-- TITLE CARD--


ACT 1
[Interior, the bunker. Cas presses shotgun shells for their trip to Purgatory while Dean tries to call Sam but the phone just rings]

DEAN: Come on, Sam!

SAM'S VOICEMAIL: This is Sam. Leave me a message.

CAS: Have you tried Eileen?

DEAN: Yeah. Same thing – no answer.

CAS: Well, maybe they just have their hands full with her case.

DEAN: Yeah. Or they're in trouble.


[Interior, The Lucky Elephant Casino. Chuck holds up a scalpel and examines it]

SAM: What are you doing?

CHUCK: Our wounds aren't healing properly. Because of you. It's as if there's something festering inside of you, something that won't let go.

[Chuck unbuttons Sam's shirt to reveal his wound, while behind his back Eileen takes out her phone and dials Dean]

CHUCK: Now, I can't see it. I can't snap it away. But I know it's there.

SAM: So, what, are you gonna just cut it out?

CHUCK: Hey, good idea.

[Meanwhile in the bunker, Dean answers the phone call from Eileen, and can hear bits of Chuck's conversation in the background]

DEAN: Eileen, where the hell are you?

CHUCK (over the phone) You're so helpful, Sam. Now sit still.

DEAN: Eileen?

[Eileen tucks the phone into her pocket, and Dean just listens to Chuck about to torture Sam]

CHUCK: I don't really know what I'm looking for here, so this might get messy.

[Chuck stops just short of cutting into Sam's wound and turns to Eileen]

CHUCK: I think we have an audience. Come on, Eileen.

[Chuck finds her phone, and hears Dean on the other end of the line]

DEAN: Eileen? Eileen?

CHUCK: Hi, Dean.

DEAN: Chuck, you dick.

CHUCK: Bye, Dean.

[Chuck hangs up on Dean by throwing Eileen's phone and smashing it against a wall. Dean and Cas realize what's been going on, and Chuck turns back to Sam]

CHUCK: Now, where were we? Right.

[Chuck walks back to Sam and begins cutting into his wound]


[Interior, the bunker, Dean searches on his laptop]

DEAN: How the hell did this happen?

CAS: What are you doing?

DEAN: Tracking Sam's phone. Okay, here we go. Uh... Milford, Nebraska, at a casino. What the hell is Chuck doing at a casino? Whatever. We need to go.

CAS: To Purgatory.

DEAN: Chuck has Sam. I'm not leaving him.

CAS: Chuck's not gonna kill him. That's not the ending.

DEAN: Wh— Then he'll torture him.

CAS: Dean, will you stop? Just stop being so stupid.

DEAN: What?

CAS: If we attack Chuck now, we don't have anything that can hurt him. We get that Leviathan blossom, complete Michael's spell, build the Cage. That's our chance. That's the way we'll save Sam, and that's the way we'll save the world.


[Interior, the Casino. Chuck hesitates again on cutting Sam's wound]

SAM: What's the matter, Chuck?

CHUCK: Nothing. I'm just – I'm thinking.

SAM: No. You're stalling.

CHUCK: What? Am not.

SAM: You are.

CHUCK: Mnh-mnh. No.

SAM: Yeah. You blink people out of existence. But when it's time to get your hands dirty, you can't do it. You just like to watch. Wow, Chuck. That – That's a... I don't even know what to call that.

EILEEN: I do. I'd call it pathetic.

CHUCK: You know what? You're right. I do like to watch. Eileen.

[Chuck forces Eileen to stand and puts the blade in her hand, controlling her like a puppet, forcing her to walk toward Sam]

EILEEN: Sam... No.

SAM: What are you doing to her?

EILEEN: Stop, please.

[Chuck snaps his fingers and silences Eileen]

CHUCK: Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Ah, why didn't I think of this first? It's so much more poetic. Eileen? She's still in there, Sam. This is gonna hurt her as much as it hurts you.

[Eileen shakes her head and cries as Chuck forces her hand to stab Sam's wound]

SAM: Ahh!

CHUCK: Ohh. Mnh! Maybe not quite as much.


[Exterior: Purgatory. Dean and Cas have just come through the rift]

DEAN: I mean, how the hell are we supposed to even know what we're looking for here? You know, Michael coulda done us a solid and drawn us a picture.

CAS: You know, of all the time I've been in Purgatory, I've never seen a bloom of any kind.

DEAN: Yeah. Exactly.

CAS: Well, if we see it, we'll know. It's likely to be the only flower here.

DEAN: Alright. Well, maybe we'll run into Benny. He's probably king of this place by now. [Dean checks his phone, and the countdown timer to when the rift home will close. 10:48:54 remaining] Okay. Let's split up.

CAS: What?

DEAN: You go that way. I'll go this way. We'll meet back at the Rift, alright? We'll cover more ground. We'll better our odds.

CAS: Yeah. We'll also improve our odds of getting lost or killed. Come on.

[Cas sets out, and Dean follows after him]


[Interior, Casino. Eileen continues cutting into Sam under Chuck's control while he sits back and watches, playing his guitar]

Sam: Ahh! Ahh! [to Eileen] It's okay. It's okay. I know – I know it's not you. [to Chuck] It's not working.

[Chuck pulls Eileen's hand away and Sam sags in relief]

SAM: I'm gonna die in this chair, Chuck.

[Chuck plunges the scalpel back into Sam's shoulder]

SAM: Ahh! Aah! Mnh. 'Cause you'll keep cutting until I bleed out, and... that's 'cause you don't know what else to do. What then, Chuck? You – You – You just bring me back and try again?

[Chuck stops playing his guitar and puts it down as he jumps up from his chair]

CHUCK: Son of a bitch!

[Chuck heals the damage done to Sam's wound and sends Eileen away]

CHUCK (to Eileen): Go. Go. Clean yourself up. [to Sam] How are you still like this?

SAM: Like what?

CHUCK: This...defiant.

SAM: It's not my first time on the rack.

CHUCK: No, no, no, no. No, this is more. This is...hope. Ah. That's what's stopping me – you. You still think that Dean and Cas are gonna fly through those doors just in the nick of time. You still think that you're the hero of this story. You still think you can win.


ACT 2
[Exterior, Purgatory. Dean and Cas still explore in the dark, and come across a body]

DEAN: I think we're going around in circles. We've seen this corpse before.

CAS: No, Dean, my sense of direction is excellent. That's a different corpse.

DEAN: I don't know.

[Dean crouches over to examine the body as someone sneaks up on them. It's a Leviathan, who attacks. But Dean and Cas were ready for him. Cas sends him flying with a gesture and he lands with a thud]

LEVIATHAN: Ugh!

DEAN: You're right. It is a different corpse.

CAS: We saw you following us.

DEAN: Thought you'd never make your move.

LEVIATHAN: What do you want?

DEAN: Well, it's a little embarrassing saying it loud, but we're looking for a flower.

LEVIATHAN: A flower? What do I look like, a florist?

DEAN: Well, if you can't help us, see this boom stick? It's loaded with Borax-filled shells. You know what Borax does to piranha-faced freaks like you? I'd be happy to show you.

LEVIATHAN: We don't call it a flower. There's a blossom. Grows out of the soil when we die.

CAS: When...Leviathan die?

DEAN: Oh, okay. Cool.

[Dean stands up and cocks his gun, prepared to kill the Leviathan to get the blossom]

LEVIATHAN: I – Hey! The body has to rot. It can take months. And then these blossoms bloom. Tan husks, bloody red centers. I know a place. Not far.

DEAN: And look at that. Thought you weren't a florist. Get up. [The Leviathan does, and starts to walk away. Dean stops him] Wait. You know a vamp around here named Benny? Burly guy, Cajun?

LEVIATHAN: No. Heard of him, though. Everybody has. The guy who got out and then came back. Like an idiot.

DEAN: Pretty much. Where is he?

LEVIATHAN: Dead. Long time ago. His own kind – they didn't trust him, and they – ksch! – ripped him apart.

DEAN: Move.


[Interior, Casino]

CHUCK: How do I put this to you, Sam? Your hope is... misplaced. Now, I'm not saying you can't win. I mean, if you stay firm and Dean and Cas don't screw up their part, with the exact right roll of the dice... you could. But what I'm saying is... you don't want to. You think you do, but you don't. Not if you knew. Not if you could see what I see. You want to know what happens when you win? Here. I'll show you.


[Chuck claps his hands, and we are transported to the bunker. A version of Sam and Eileen sit in the library working, while Sam is forced to watch. The date is April 17, 2020, 11:42.02 PM]

EILEEN: Whoa. [Gasps as she reads an article under the headline "Mystery of Missing Florida Man Solved]

SAM: Find something?

EILEEN: No. That man who disappeared in Florida –

SAM: Yeah.

EILEEN: Turns out he was eaten by an alligator.

[vision-Sam turns to see Dean nodding off in a chair]

SAM: Hey, Dean, if you're tired, why don't you go to bed?

DEAN: I'm not tired. I'm not tired. I'm just resting my eyes. I'm good. [Cas brings four bottles of beer into the library and sets them on the table] Ooh. Jackpot. [Dean shuts his laptop and takes a beer from Cas] Ahh. Thanks. Alright, well, I say let's call it, hmm? Movie night?

EILEEN: I'll make popcorn.

[Sam's cellphone rings]

SAM: Oh. Jody. Jody. Hey. How's it going? Jody?

JODY: Sam...

SAM: Yeah. Hey.

JODY: It was just supposed to be a little nest, maybe three vampires. Claire and I went in armed to the teeth, but there were more. So many more. She's dead, Sam. Claire's dead. Claire's dead.

SAM [real Sam]: No.


[Sam comes to back in the casino, still tied to his chair]

CHUCK: Oh, that was just the beginning. No. This is... the rest. The other side of victory. What happens next. [He holds up a pocket watch] You just set it forward to any day or time, and you can see it all.

SAM: Nothing you show me... You cannot change my mind.

CHUCK: Then it doesn't change your mind. Come on, Sam. Don't you want to see the future?


[Exterior, Purgatory, daylight as Dean and Cas follow the Leviathan along a riverbank]

CAS: Sorry about Benny.

DEAN: I owed him my life. And he sacrificed himself to get Sam out of this place.

CAS: Well, this place will bring that out in you. Guilt. It was my fault the Leviathan got out. It was my fault we were here the first time. I carry that guilt every day.

DEAN: I know you're sorry, Cas. About Bel, about Mom.

CAS: I was talking about Jack. I already apologized to you. You just refused to hear it.

DEAN: Sorry I brought it up. Maybe if you didn't just up and leave us.

CAS: You didn't give me a choice. You couldn't forgive me. And you couldn't move on. You were too angry. I left, but you didn't stop me.


[January 6, 2021, 9:09:18 PM, Chuck's pocket watch ticks as he shows Sam another bit of a potential future. Dean and Sam in the Impala, bloodied from a fight]

DEAN: I know what you're thinking. But we did everything we could.

SAM: No, we didn't. We could've gone in there sooner.

DEAN: The place was crawling with wolves. We had to wait.

SAM: And because we waited, the victims – they all died. They bled out on the floor. Now, if Cas was still here, he could've healed them.

DEAN: Yeah, well, he's not.

[Real Sam sits in the back seat witnessing this conversation, shocked and horrified]

SAM: Cas?

[Real Sam looks at the watch in his hand and the conversation continues]

DEAN: They're winning, Sam. The monsters are winning.


[Exterior, Purgatory, a field of rotting Leviathan corpses where strange blossoms sprout from the ground, as the Leviathan described them]

LEVIATHAN: It's up this way. Just like I promised.

CAS: Leviathan blossom.

DEAN: Alright, well, grab one. Let's get the hell out of here.

[Cas walks toward the blossoms, and becomes stuck]

DEAN: Cas?

CAS: It's an angel trap. You tricked us.

LEVIATHAN: Mother's got beef with you.

CAS: Eve. Eve.

LEVIATHAN: Killing her alphas, swallowing her Leviathan. Bringing you to her should earn us a nice reward.

DEAN: What do you mean, "us"?

CAS: Dean!

[A group of Leviathans steps out of the forest and attacks. Dean shoots one with Borax before another knocks him out]


ACT 3
[Exterior, Purgatory. Dean regains consciousness to find all the Leviathan Blossoms destroyed by fire]

DEAN: No. [he looks around, and is alone] Cas? Cas!


[Interior, the bunker. Sam loads a gun. The date is November 3, 2021, 11:42:38 AM. Again, Real Sam is forced to watch]

DEAN: What are you doing? Come on, man. We just got back.

SAM: I-If we don't hustle, the nest'll move on.

DEAN: No, Sam. It doesn't matter.

SAM: What are you saying?

DEAN: What I've been trying to say for months. It's time... time to stand down.

SAM: You want to quit? What's happened to you, Dean? Ever since –

DEAN: Ever since what? We lost pretty much everyone we've ever cared about? Ever since the Mark made Cas go crazy? Ever since I had to bury him in a Ma'lak box? Ever since then? Yeah. You know why? 'Cause the monsters – they're everywhere. Everywhere! What we do – it's not even Hunting anymore. It's whack-a-mole. We don't even save people. Every friend we've ever had is either dead, or they got wise and they packed it in.

SAM: Jody's still fighting, and Bobby –

DEAN: Bobby has a death wish, and you know it. And Jody – ever since what happened to Donna and the girls, she does, too. And after Eileen... so do you.

SAM: No. What happened to Butch and Sundance? Dean, what happened to going out swinging?

DEAN: We lost, brother. We lost. I'm done.

SAM: No, no, no. Dean... Dean!

[Dean walks out, and Real Sam is incredulous]

SAM: This is a lie. Chuck, I know what you're doing. Chuck?!

CHUCK: Enjoying the show?

SAM: You're just showing me this so I give up, so I lose hope.

CHUCK: I'm just the messenger, Sam. I'm sharing my omniscience with you.

SAM: No, the Dean I know... the Dean who raised me – he'd never give up, no matter how bad things got.

CHUCK: Well, he does. He will. This is the truth, Sam. This is what comes next.


[Exterior, Purgatory. Dean wanders the woods, alone, desperately trying to find Cas]

DEAN: Cas!

[Dean checks his phone. The time remaining is 00:29:54]

DEAN: No, no, no. [Dean looks around and then speaks quietly in prayer] Cas? Cas, I hope you can hear me... that wherever you are, it's not too late. I should've stopped you. You're my best friend, but I just let you go. 'Cause it was easier than admitting I was wrong. [Dean breaks down, sniffles, and then kneels at the base of the tree]

I – Ohh. I don't know why I get so angry. I just know – I know that it's – i-it's just always been there. And when things go bad, it just – it comes out. And I can't -- I can't stop it. No matter how – [Sniffles] how bad I want to, I just can't stop it. And – And I – I forgive you. Of course I forgive you. I'm sorry it took me so long – [Sniffles] I'm sorry it took me till now to say it. Cas, I'm – I'm so sorry. Man, I hope you can hear me. I hope you can hear me. [Sniffling] Okay.


[Interior, the bunker. The date is November 3 2021, 12:36:40 PM. Dean sits quietly with his eyes shut]

SAM: I'm raiding that nest with or without you.

DEAN: Then I guess I don't have a choice, do I?

CHUCK [to Real Sam]: Oh. They're back. Oh, Dean, bad idea. You should've trusted your... [Door slams as Sam and Dean leave the bunker] gut.

SAM: No. It can't end like this.

CHUCK: See for yourself. You're holding the watch.

[Sam twists the knob on the watch, advancing the time until it won't go any further, on December 9, 2022, at 3:11: 23]

SAM: It's stuck.

CHUCK: Guess that's as far as it goes, Sammy. The end of the line.


[Exterior, Purgatory, Dean still searches for Cas. He checks his phone, and only 00:02:56 remains on their timer]

CAS: Dean.

[Dean raises his gun and turns to see Cas sitting at the base of a tree]

DEAN: Cas?

CAS: You made it.

DEAN: I made it?

[Cas gets to his feet and they hug]

DEAN: You okay?

CAS: I'm fine.

DEAN: What happened?

CAS: They were after me, not you. I figured it would be safest to give myself up.

DEAN: They take you to Eve?

CAS: Yeah. We were en route. I waited until I... saw this. [Cas pulls a blossom out of his coat] It got a little smushed.

[Dean chuckles]

CAS: Once I had the blossom, I fought, caught them off guard. They fought back. I managed to get away.

DEAN: You did it. You did it, Cas.

CAS: Well, they're still after me. We should hurry.

DEAN: Okay, Cas, I need to say something.

CAS :You don't have to say it. I heard your prayer.


[Interior, a seedy run-down motel room, December 9, 2022, 3:11:38 AM. Sam and Dean have barricaded themselves inside]

SAM: Alright, only way in.

DEAN: Let 'em come.

SAM: We're outnumbered.

DEAN: What else is new? Those bastards take us down, at least we go down together.

SAM: Butch and Sundance.

DEAN: Go out swinging.

[Sam checks Chuck's watch, and it's still stuck. Meanwhile, in the stairwell outside the motel room, several hunters, including Jody and Bobby, converge on their room]

BOBBY: Hold up. You sure you want to do this, Jody? It's Sam and Dean.

[Inside the room, Sam and Dean both bear vampire fangs and await the attack. In the hall, Jody nods and they go. They fight. Sam kills one hunter, Dean throws another out the window. Jody shoots vampire!Sam and he drops to his knees, while Dean attacks and kills Jody. Bobby comes in and beheads vampire!Sam, and Real Sam wakes up, still shackled to his chair in the casino]

CHUCK: So, what'd you think?


ACT 4
[Interior, the casino, where we left off]

CHUCK: I'm sorry, kid. It's a crappy ending. You and your brother deserve better.

SAM: Yeah, right.

CHUCK: No. I mean it. I-It hurts me to see you go out like that. Listen, I know our friendship has seen better days. But you have to know – you and your brother matter to me. Deeply. You still do. I want better for you both.

SAM: Where's Eileen?

CHUCK: She's fine. I powered her down in a broom closet. Don't change the subject.

SAM: You know, Chuck... I've seen your plans. Dean and Me, Cain and Abel.

CHUCK: You don't know what you saw, Sam.

SAM: I know it didn't look better to me.

CHUCK: Okay, so, that way? Hmm? You being monsters? You being killed off by your friends? You really like that ending better?


[Interior, the bunker library. Dean and Cas work the Leviathan Blossom spell]

CAS: Zee-loh-dah-rup, ah-lahr, zee-zohp, ah-buh-rah-muh-jzh, ahm-ee-zuh-pee --

[Cas prepares to add his blood to the spell]

DEAN: Wait. Wait. Wait. Are you sure?

CAS: Dean, you've already taken the Mark. You can't take it again. I can. It's the only way.

DEAN: Okay.

[Dean ignites the spell while Cas holds a black sphere above the smoke to capture the power of it. He hands the sphere to Dean]

CAS: Because I'm taking the Mark, someone else will have to destroy this. You or Sam.


[Interior, the casino]

SAM: It'll be better. It'll be better. It'll be better. [Exhales sharply] If we win – When we win – When we beat you, I will make it better!

CHUCK: You can't, Sam. You, Sam Winchester, have been playing fast and loose with the laws of nature and magic for a very long time – you and your brother. Always breaking the rules. And that's what I love about you, Sam. It's so heroic. It's so...Promethean. But there's still so much about the fabric of the universe that you don't know... that you can't know. 'Cause you're only humans. But I'm God. Think about what I showed you. Look beyond the Mark, beyond you and Dean fanging out – heartbreaking, but not the headline news.

SAM: The monsters.

CHUCK: The monsters.

[Exterior, tires screech as the Impala races toward Sam]

CHUCK: Without me, it's a law of nature – dark forces prevail, monsters rule, and you, your brother, and everyone you love will die. Can you really live with that?


[Dean and Cas enter the casino silently, and search for Sam]

SAM: Dean? Help. Help me!

DEAN: Hey. Where's Chuck?

SAM: I don't know. He's close. Watch out!

[As Dean cuts Sam free from the chair, Eileen sneaks up behind him, and hits Dean with Chuck's guitar. She continues the attack with the scalpel]

DEAN: Eileen, I don't want to hurt you.

[Cas tackles Eileen and Sam picks up Dean's knife]

CHUCK: Hi, Dean.

[Dean turns and punches Chuck in the face, which barely even moves him]

DEAN: You know I had to.

[Chuck nods, but punches Dean back, sending him flying across the room]

Chuck: Me, too.

CAS: Sam.

[Cas holds up the sphere to show it to Sam, and then rolls it across the floor to him]

DEAN: Sam, smash it. Now!

[Sam holds the sphere, and hesitates]

CHUCK: Well, Sam?

[Sam wrestles with the choice, and drops to his knees, letting the sphere roll away. Chuck stops it with his foot]

DEAN: Sam!

SAM: I can't.

DEAN: What?

SAM: I can't. I'm sorry. I... I just can't.

DEAN: What did you do to him?

[Chuck is finally able to heal the wound on his shoulder, and Sam's wound heals too]

CHUCK: Ahh. Ahh! Yeah! Oh, man. Whew! Yeah, that's the stuff.

CAS: What happened?

CHUCK: Um, short version – Sammy lost hope, and now I'm free. Hey, take it easy on the kid. It took a lot to beat it out of him.

[Chuck crushes the sphere, destroying the spell]

DEAN: No. No! Well, what now? You're not gonna dust us.

CHUCK: Oh, yeah? Why not?

DEAN: Because you're holding out. For your big finish. Yeah, we know about your galaxy-brained idea, how you think this story is gonna go. Sam got a little look into your draft folder.

CHUCK: Sam's visions – they weren't drafts. They were memories. My memories. Other Sams and other Deans in other worlds. But guess what. Just like you, they didn't think they'd do it, either. But they did. And you will, too.

DEAN: No. Not this Sam. And not this Dean. So you go back to Earth 2 and play with your other toys. Because we will never give you the ending that you want.

CHUCK: We'll see.

[Chuck vanishes]


ACT 5
[Interior, the bunker.]

SAM: I wish you'd stay.

EILEEN: I wish I could. After what happened, I don't know what's real anymore.

[Sam leans in and kisses Eileen]

SAM: I know that was real.

[Eileen touches his cheek, and then leaves. Sam goes to the kitchen and finds Dean and Cas sitting at the table having a drink]

DEAN: Did she leave?

SAM: Yeah. Yeah.

DEAN: Sorry.

SAM: That was our, uh, chance... to stop Chuck. But what Chuck showed me, what would happen if we trapped him – I believed him. I still do.

DEAN: Well, that's good enough for me.

SAM: Okay, uh, so, what now?

CAS: Well, Chuck's gone, but...

DEAN: He'll be back.

SAM: If we can't kill him or trap him...

DEAN: Well, then we find another way.


[Meanwhile, Jack paces in the Empty. Billie joins him]

BILLIE: It's time.
