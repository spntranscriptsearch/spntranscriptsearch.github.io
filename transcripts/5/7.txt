PROLOGUE
INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

A WOMAN, MRS. XAVIER, is reading the Weekly World News, headline: "LEADING PSYCHICS AGREE: THE APOCALYPSE IS HERE! Experts confirm the end is upon us!" She chuckles. The door opens.

MRS. XAVIER
Hey, babe.

MR. XAVIER hurries upstairs without a word.

MRS. XAVIER
Nice to see you, too.

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

MR. XAVIER rushes into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. He turns on the water in the sink and leans forward, staring into the mirror. He is a young man, but ages rapidly, skin wrinkling, hair going gray and falling out, eyes going white-blind. He stumbles backward into a cabinet, smashing glass.

INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

MRS. XAVIER hears the crash and looks up.

MRS. XAVIER
Honey?

MR. XAVIER collapses.

INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

SAM and DEAN, in suits, hold up CDC badges.

DOCTOR
You expect me to believe you're CDC?

DEAN looks at SAM.

SAM
Excuse me?

DOCTOR
It's just that you're a day early. First time in history I haven't sat on my ass waiting for you people.

DEAN
New administration. A change you can believe in.

DOCTOR
Right.

INT. MORGUE – DAY

The DOCTOR pulls the corpse of MR. XAVIER out of a freezer. He looks like a dead eighty-year-old.

DOCTOR
Meet Xavier. Date of birth, April third, nineteen eighty-four.

THE CURIOUS CASE OF DEAN WINCHESTER

She exchanges glances with DEAN and SAM.

DOCTOR
I know. I ran the DNA twice. That's definitely him.

DEAN
Well, he wasn't big on the sunscreen, huh?

SAM
So, what's your theory?

DOCTOR
All I know is, decedent's male, twenty-five years old—

Couple missing persons, but usual for a town this size.

CHRISTOPHER RUSSELL

DEAN

Yeah. You know, just...in general?

And
CHAD EVERETT

BOBBY
Oh, you mean my legs. Well, I'm just weepin' in my Haagen-Dazs. Idjit.

SAM
How long has he been missing?

MRS. WHITLOW
Oh, I knew right away when he didn't come home Tuesday night.

DEAN
Is there someplace he likes to go after work, maybe? A favorite bar?

MRS. WHITLOW laughs.

MRS. WHITLOW
No. Tuesdays, he always works a bit late, but he always comes straight home.

DEAN
A wrinkly, gooey corpse.

They go on to stop outside room 44.

Directed by
ROBERT SINGER

SAM pulls out his lockpick kit and selects two while DEAN keeps watch. A MAN starts shouting inside the room.

MAN
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh! Oh, God!

SAM and DEAN look at each other and slam the door open.

MAN
Hey! What the—

The MAN, apparently naked, is in bed with a WOMAN, barely dressed.

SAM
Oh.

DEAN
God.

Another WOMAN comes out from under the covers.

SAM
It's gooey.

Both WOMEN flee the bed.

DEAN
Sorry. Uh, got the wrong room.

MAN
Close the door!

DEAN is outside and SAM is about to close the door behind them when he notices something.

SAM
Hey.

The MAN has a USMC tattoo that looks exactly like CLIFF WHITLOW's.

SAM
Nice tattoo.

SAM comes back into the room.

SAM
Happen to know anybody named Cliff Whitlow?

The MAN shakes his head.

MAN
Never heard of him.

SAM
Well, that's weird.

SAM pulls an ID out of the wallet that was apparently in the MAN's pants.

SAM
'Cause you're carrying his wallet.

DEAN goes over to the bed and yanks up the covers to look underneath.

DEAN
Huh.

DEAN drops the sheets.

DEAN
Your wife told us about your, uh, birthmark there. That's nice. Well, you look great. Cliff. Did you get some work done?

CLIFF shakes his head and sighs.

CLIFF
Could you give us some privacy?

The two WOMEN are robed now. DEAN winks at them, then goes back to glaring at CLIFF. CLIFF, also robed now, hands one of them some money and they leave. He closes the door behind them.

CLIFF
Please don't tell my wife.

DEAN
Slow down.

CLIFF
I'm begging you. As far as she knows, I'm dead. For the love of God, let's keep it that way.

DEAN
How can you possibly be Cliff Whitlow?

CLIFF
I can't tell you.

DEAN
Well, either you tell us or we tell the missus.

CLIFF
Okay! Okay! It was a game.

SAM
Like...XBox?

CLIFF
What's XBox? No. Poker. High stakes. Instead of cash, you play for years.

DEAN
What is that supposed to mean?

CLIFF
Look, I know it sounds crazy. Guy comes up to me at a bar, invites me to play. Gives me twenty-five of these weirdo poker chips, right? Chants some mumbo humbo over them, says now they're twenty-five years. I'm laughing, but then I come out up. And look at me.

SAM
What was he chanting?

CLIFF laughs.

CLIFF
How should I know? All I know is, my bad hip's good, I threw away my glasses. One of those ladies was here for free! Man's some kind of miracle worker.

DEAN
What does this miracle worker look like?

CLIFF
Just a guy. Maybe thirty-five, brown hair. Irish accent. His name was Patrick.

DEAN
All right, all right. Where's this game at?

CLIFF
He said he likes to keep moving. Never stays in one bar long. And he finds you.

DEAN
Thank you, Cliff.

SAM and DEAN head for the door.

DEAN
Oh, and, uh...stay classy.

PHONE CONVERSATION
EXT. STREET – DAY and INT. BOBBY'S LIVING ROOM – DAY alternating

SAM and DEAN walk along the street. DEAN is on the phone with BOBBY.

DEAN
It sounds crazy, right?

BOBBY
No. There's lore on it. Goes back centuries. Traveling card player pops into town. You beat him, you get your best years back. 'Course, most folks lose.

DEAN
Well, that would explain the crunchy corpse.

BOBBY
Supposedly, this player's a hell of a card shark. Got a lot of years in the bank. You find the bar he's working in yet?

DEAN
There's a lot of dives in this town. We're gonna have to split up.

BOBBY
Well, why you still talking to me?

BOBBY hangs up. DEAN shuts his phone. BOBBY's keys are on a stack of papers; he grabs them as he rolls past.

BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

DEAN is on the phone with SAM.

SAM
Find anything?

DEAN
Yeah, a whole bunch of squat. You?

SAM
No, not a thing.

DEAN
All right. Well, you come up dry, circle back to the motel in two. Your turn to grab dinner.

SAM
Usual?

DEAN
Extra bacon.

DEAN hangs up and sits down at the bar.

DEAN
Can I get a beer?

BARTENDER
Yep.

The BARTENDER reaches for a beer bottle.

DEAN
You wouldn't happen to know of a poker game going on in back, would you?

The BARTENDER opens the bottle and passes it to DEAN.

BARTENDER
It's a bar, not a casino.

DEAN digs into his pocket.

DEAN
My friend Ben told me you'd know.

BARTENDER
Don't know any Ben.

DEAN
Sure you do. You know, balding, smart-ass, real ladies' man?

The BARTENDER leans forward.

BARTENDER
Listen, pal, I told you, I don't know any Ben. I don't know nothing about a game.

DEAN
You sure? 'Cause, uh...

DEAN slides a hundred-dollar bill, with its picture of Ben Franklin, across the bar.

DEAN
He sure seems to know you.

The BARTENDER glances down, then up, and takes the bill.

BEHIND THE BAR
EXT. BACK OF BAR – NIGHT

DEAN walks around behind the bar.

BARTENDER (voiceover)
'Round back. Take the elevator down.

Something clatters. BOBBY rolls out of what is presumably the elevator.

DEAN
Bobby? What the hell are you doing here?

BOBBY
Planting daisies. What's it look like? Came in on the case.

DEAN
And you beat me here?

DEAN
Well, brains trumps legs, apparently.

BOBBY rolls around DEAN. DEAN follows.

DEAN
So, you found the game?

BOBBY
Yep.

DEAN
Did you stop it?

BOBBY doesn't answer.

DEAN
Bobby?

BOBBY stops and turns around.

BOBBY
Not exactly.

DEAN
What did you do?

BOBBY
I played, okay?

DEAN
And?

BOBBY
I lost.

ACT TWO
BEHIND THE BAR
EXT. BACK OF BAR – NIGHT

DEAN
Are you kidding me? You played some—some he-witch?

BOBBY
Don't you take that tone with me.

DEAN
You idiot!

BOBBY
They're my years! I can do what I want!

DEAN
How many did you lose?

BOBBY
Twenty-five.

BOBBY ages before DEAN's eyes.

DEAN
We're not done.

DEAN heads into the elevator.

BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

An OLDER MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN sit at the bar; he is unnamed and her name is LIA. ANOTHER MAN stands next to them, chewing on a toothpick. He speaks with an Irish accent: this must be PATRICK.

OLDER MAN
So, you're saying that you're a mind reader.

PATRICK
Ah, come on. No such thing. But I can read people. Take your lovely companion here.

The OLDER MAN and LIA smile at each other.

PATRICK
I'd say, judging from her exquisite posture, she used to be a dancer.

LIA chuckles, indicating to the OLDER MAN that PATRICK is right on the money.

PATRICK
Not much of a drinker. Very independent. Looking for adventure.

DEAN comes up behind PATRICK, grabbing him by the arm.

DEAN
Hey, man. Excuse me. Can I borrow you for a sec?

DEAN adjusts his jacket to show PATRICK the handle of his gun. PATRICK glances down at it, then up at DEAN.

PATRICK
Oh, yeah. Of course. Great. Good to see you.

DEAN grins, nodding, and glances at the OLDER MAN and LIA.

DEAN heads for a table across the room.

PATRICK
Would you two please excuse me?

PATRICK follows DEAN to the table.

DEAN
Sorry to cut you short with Mr. and Mrs. Easy Marks over there.

PATRICK
Oh, no big.

PATRICK holds up a gold wristwatch.

PATRICK
Wasn't a total loss.

Under the table, DEAN pulls out his gun.

PATRICK
Look, I don't know what it is you think I did to your wife or girlfriend—

DEAN frowns, confused. PATRICK keeps fishing.

PATRICK
—mother or sister, but, uh, I just want you to know, my feelings were real.

DEAN
That ain't my problem, man-witch. You owe my friend some years.

PATRICK
Oh, that's what this is. I'm sorry. He lost. Them's the breaks.

DEAN
Well, then un-lose him.

DEAN cocks the gun. PATRICK flicks a glance down.

PATRICK
Oh, go ahead and shoot me, if it makes you feel better. Besides, I could use a good...you know...tickle. You want years? Great. Play me for 'em.

DEAN
Fine.

BOBBY has come up to the table.

BOBBY
Dean, no!

DEAN
They're my years. I can do what I want.

BOBBY coughs. PATRICK holds up a cough drop.

PATRICK
Lozenge?

BOBBY wheezes.

PATRICK
What? It's barely linty. Okay, well, suit yourself. Just trying to help.

DEAN
All right, all right. Come on. Let's do this.

PATRICK
You understand the terms?

PATRICK sets a red case on the table. He opens it, chewing on a toothpick. It contains eight stacks of poker chips. He pulls out a stack of red chips. He takes the toothpick out of his mouth.

PATRICK
Buy-in's twenty-five years.

PATRICK closes the box.

DEAN
Make it fifty.

BOBBY glances at DEAN. PATRICK takes the toothpick back out of his mouth.

PATRICK
I like the cut of your jib.

DEAN smirks. PATRICK gives DEAN another stack of red chips and holds his hand over them.

PATRICK
Lannraich gu dealrach a-nis.

Light flicks along both stacks. PATRICK goes back to chewing his toothpick. DEAN takes them and counts the chips in one stack.

DEAN
Twenty-five. That's twenty-five years. They go to him.

DEAN pushes the chips into the middle of the table.

DEAN
And he's cashing out.

BOBBY
Dean!

DEAN
Bobby.

PATRICK
You sure?

DEAN
Yes.

PATRICK nods and holds his hand over the chips.

PATRICK
Las suas agus cuir ás an teine. Mar sin bitheadh.

The chips catch fire, burn to ash and blow away. BOBBY is back to normal.

PATRICK
That's twenty-five years you just pissed away. Better be sure you can win them back.

DEAN taps his remaining chips.

DEAN
Shuffle up and deal.

PATRICK laughs.

PATRICK
This is gonna be fun.

MOTEL
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

SAM opens the door and comes in, carrying a takeout tray with burgers and two sodas. He puts it on the table.

SAM
Hey, Dean? You find anything?

OLD MAN
Uh, you might say.

SAM startles and draws his gun, aiming for the OLD MAN in the bathrobe.

SAM
Who the hell are you!

OLD MAN
Dude, relax. It's me.

SAM lowers the gun: the OLD MAN is very familiar.

SAM
Dean?

DEAN
Hi.

SAM
What the hell happened?

DEAN
I, you know...found the game.

DEAN heads for the food and picks up a burger.

SAM
You f—I thought you said you were g-good at poker.

DEAN
I am. Shut up. So, you were just gonna shoot some old guy? Is that it?

SAM
I didn't know what you were. I mean, have you seen you? You look like—

DEAN talks with his mouth full.

DEAN
The old chick in Titanic. I know. shut up.

SAM
I was gonna say Emperor Palpatine.

The door thuds open. BOBBY rolls in. The door closes.

BOBBY
I see you met John McCain there.

SAM
Yeah. Either of you want to tell me what happened?

DEAN
Bobby's an idiot. That's what happened.

BOBBY
Hey, nobody asked you to play.

DEAN
Right. I should have just let you die.

BOBBY
And for damn sure, nobody asked you to lose!

SAM grins.

SAM
It's like Grumpy Old Men.

DEAN and BOBBY turn to SAM and speak in unison.

DEAN and BOBBY
Shut up, Sam.

DEAN
What the hell were you thinking? He's a witch. He's been playing poker since guys wore tights.

BOBBY
You just don't get it.

DEAN
Yeah, I get it, Bobby. You saw a chance to turn the hands of the clock back and get out of that damn chair. Pretty tempting. I can imagine.

BOBBY
No, you can't.

DEAN
You got me. I never been paralyzed. But I tell you something—I've been to hell, and there's an archangel there wanting me to drop the soap. Look at me! My junk's rustier than yours! You hear me bellyaching? Huh?

SAM
Uh, actually, yeah.

DEAN
Oh!

DEAN sits down, still holding his burger.

DEAN
I'm having a heart attack.

SAM looks, worried.

BOBBY
No, you're not.

DEAN
What is it?

BOBBY
Acid reflux. Guys your age can't digest certain foods. You're gonna need to put down that cheeseburger.

DEAN sighs and puts down the burger.

BOBBY
So, you want to keep emoting, or you want to talk about solving this little issue of yours? It's got to be about the chips.

DEAN
I slid 'em across, Patrick did his little witchy number, and you prettied up in a hurry.

SAM
I mean, what are you all thinking? Some kind of magic chips or something?

BOBBY
Definitely.

SAM sits down.

DEAN
You remember what he chanted?

BOBBY
Yep—every word.

SAM
All right, then let's find out where he stashes his chips.

DEAN
And steal me fifty. Benjamin Button me back into burger shape. What do you think?

BOBBY
I think you ought to put some clothes on.

DEAN, fully dressed, goes to answer a knock on the door. It's a young, pretty MAID with a cart and an armful of towels.

MAID
Ready for housekeeping, sir?

DEAN grins.

DEAN
Born ready.

The MAID laughs.

MAID
You're just like my grandfather.

DEAN's grin fades.

MAID
He hits on anything that moves, too.

She heads past him into the room.

MAID
You're adorable.

DEAN
And dangerous.

MAID
Aw.

She laughs, heading for the bathroom. SAM smirks and so does BOBBY.

DEAN
Can we just go?

STREET
EXT. STREET – NIGHT

BOBBY, SAM, and DEAN sit in BOBBY's van, watching people go by. PATRICK comes out of a building. He checks his watch and crosses the street without looking, noticing too late that a car is coming: it slams right into him. The DRIVER gets out and checks his injuries: it doesn't look like PATRICK can have survived. The DRIVER runs over to a construction crew nearby.

DRIVER
Guys, get some help! He came out of nowhere! Right out in front of me!

BOBBY, SAM, and DEAN all stare. Another car drives by: PATRICK's in the driver's seat. The DRIVER and the construction workers look between him and where PATRICK got hit by the DRIVER's car.

DEAN laughs.

DEAN
I got to say, I kind of like the guy.

APARTMENT BUILDING
EXT. SKYSCRAPER – NIGHT

BOBBY, SAM, and DEAN have followed PATRICK here, and now watch him leave the building, get in his car, and drive off. DEAN looks at SAM, who looks at BOBBY, who looks at SAM, who looks at DEAN, who looks at PATRICK.

INT. STATESBOROUGH APARTMENT BUILDING – NIGHT

DEAN holds the door open while SAM rolls BOBBY inside. SAM and DEAN let BOBBY roll himself. BOBBY stops and sighs.

BOBBY
Well, I'm out.

A sign on the elevator reads "ELEVATOR OUT OF ORDER SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE". SAM looks at it, then at BOBBY, and sighs.

INT. STAIRS – NIGHT

SAM jogs up a flight of stairs with no difficulty. DEAN walks up one step at a time. SAM stops on the landing.

SAM
Dean.

SAM points to a sign with a large 2. DEAN sighs. SAM continues up the stairs. DEAN glares at the sign, then, determined, follows.

INT. CORRIDOR – NIGHT

SAM leaves the stairwell. A long pause. DEAN follows, breathing hard. SAM sorts through lockpicks in front of room 3701.

APARTMENT
INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

The lock clicks open. SAM and DEAN enter. They search the place. DEAN opens an armoire, knocks on the back, moves things, and opens the false back. There's a safe.

DEAN
Sam?

SAM comes over.

DEAN
Dime-store model. Piece of cake.

DEAN turns the dial, squinting and leaning in and out: the numbers are too blurred for him to read.

SAM
It's like Mission: Pathetic. Watch out.

SAM pushes DEAN out of the way and turns the dial: it opens quickly. There are quite a few poker chips in the safe.

DEAN
I could have done that.

SAM frowns at him and starts to grab handfuls of chips.

LIA
What are you doing?

SAM and DEAN turn around. LIA is standing there, wearing a large silver locket.

DEAN
Aren't you the chick from the bar?

LIA
I'm a lot more than that.

She throws up a hand, clenches a fist, and twists. DEAN doubles over. PATRICK hurries up and puts a hand on her arm.

PATRICK
It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right. They're harmless.

LIA lets DEAN go. PATRICK steps forward.

PATRICK
You boys want chips? Take 'em. They're just chips, Einsteins. It's showmanship. This may come as a shock, but the magic does not lie in a pile of crappy plywood or in any phony abracadabra. It's in the nine-hundred-year-old witch. You boys want years? Score 'em the old-fashioned way. Texas hold 'em.

PATRICK chews on his toothpick.

DEAN
Fine. Let's do it.

PATRICK pulls a card out of a pocket. It's the eight of hearts.

PATRICK
What card am I holding up?

DEAN squints at it and doesn't answer.

PATRICK
That's what I thought. If your eyesight's that bad, what about your memory? I'm not a murderer. You, on the other hand...

DEAN looks back at SAM.

DEAN
No, Sam.

SAM
Dean.

PATRICK
What, Sam not much of a player? Okay, well, happy trails, Dean. Enjoy the twilight of your life. Should have taken better care of that ticker, though.

PATRICK opens the door.

PATRICK
You're free to go.

DEAN takes the hint to leave. SAM follows.

PATRICK
Oh, but, Sam...

SAM and DEAN stop at the door.

PATRICK
Your brother's situation—that's punishment enough, but I can't let you leave without a small parting gift.

PATRICK claps three times.

SAM
What are you doing?

PATRICK
You'll find out soon enough.

DEAN
Let's get out of here, Sam.

They leave. PATRICK closes the door behind them.

INT. CORRIDOR – NIGHT

SAM and DEAN head for the outside door. SAM scratches at the inside of his thighs. SAM opens the door for himself and DEAN and scratches some more.

DEAN
Dude...

SAM turns to DEAN.

DEAN
I believe that he-witch gave you the clap.

SAM goes stiff for a moment, then marches off. DEAN laughs.

ACT THREE
MOTEL PARKING LOT
EXT. CICERO MOTEL – DAY

DEAN, SAM, and BOBBY head towards the motel. To get there, they have to go up an incline. SAM and DEAN have no trouble. BOBBY tries to roll himself up and can't.

BOBBY
Little help here?

DEAN and SAM stop. SAM goes down and pushes BOBBY up the incline. DEAN walks alongside.

SAM
You know, I still think I should play.

At the top of the incline. BOBBY takes over rolling himself. DEAN stops walking, so SAM and BOBBY stop too.

DEAN
No, no, no. You're not good enough. I'm better. Bobby's way better. We both lost.

BOBBY
Exactly.

SAM
So, what? So I don't get a say in this anymore?

DEAN
Sammy, when you get to be our age—

SAM
You're thirty, Dean! Look, I've watched you hustle plenty of poker—

BOBBY
Knowing the game is not enough, Sam. It's not about playing the cards.

SAM
It's about playing the other guy. I know that.

BOBBY
Well, hooray for you. All I'm saying is, I played this guy. I know his style. I can take him.

DEAN
No, Bobby. You don't have enough years in the bank.

BOBBY
I got enough.

SAM
No, you'll die if you lose, Bobby.

BOBBY
So what if I do, huh? What exactly am I living for, huh? The damn apocalypse? Watching men die bloody while I sit in this chair, can't take a step to help 'em?

DEAN
Bobby—

BOBBY
No, no. It's the facts. I'm old...and broke down...and I can't...

BOBBY takes a moment to breathe.

BOBBY
I ain't a hunter no more. I'm useless. And if I wasn't such a coward, I'd have stuck a gun in my mouth day I got home from the hospital.

Silence.

SAM
Bobby, you are not playing again. I'm not letting you do that. There's another way out of this. There's got to be. And I'm gonna find it.

SAM goes past DEAN and BOBBY.

MOTEL ROOM
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

DEAN opens the door so BOBBY can roll in. BOBBY looks up and stops abruptly. LIA is sitting on the bed. She holds up a piece of paper.

LIA
Take it. It'll help you.

BOBBY rolls closer and takes it.

BOBBY
What is this?

LIA
The most powerful reversal spell you've ever laid your eyes on.

DEAN
And it reverses what?

LIA
Patrick's work—all of it.

DEAN
You—you saying I could be normal again?

LIA
You and everyone else he's ever played.

She corrects herself.

LIA
Who's still alive.

DEAN
Why the hell should we trust you?

LIA
Trust me, don't trust me. I don't care. The spell is real.

LIA gets up and heads for the door.

BOBBY
If it zaps everyone, don't that include your man?

LIA
And me, too. I look good for my age.

BOBBY
Lady, this don't add up for squat. Why would you want that?

LIA
I have my reasons.

LIA looks at her silver locket.

LIA
Do it quick. We leave town tomorrow.

LIA leaves. DEAN and BOBBY watch her go, then look at each other.

BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK chews on a toothpick. There's a glass of whiskey in front of him. On the table are five cards in a row, the eight of spades, five and four of clubs, king of diamonds, and jack of hearts, and a pile of poker chips, about three dozen. His opponent, an old man named HESH, clinks his poker chips against each other (he has at most ten), looking at his two face-down cards. PATRICK looks at his own cards: the kings of hearts and spades, for three of a kind. HESH has the nines of clubs and diamonds for one pair. HESH throws a few chips on the pile.

HESH
Bet.

PATRICK takes out his toothpick.

PATRICK
I sense you've got me by the jewels on this one, Hesh. I fold.

HESH collects his chips.

PATRICK
What are you up—like thirteen years there, Hesh? What do you say we call it a day?

HESH chuckles.

HESH
Thanks, Patrick.

PATRICK looks up. HESH, when he realizes PATRICK is talking to someone behind him, turns: it's SAM.

PATRICK
Hesh here is gonna live to see his granddaughter's bat mitzvah. Isn't that right, Hesh?

HESH turns back.

HESH
Thanks again, Patrick.

PATRICK
Shalom, my friend. Shalom.

HESH gets up and leaves. PATRICK shuffles the cards.

SAM
That was nice of you.

PATRICK
I'm a nice guy. What can I do you for?

PATRICK keeps shuffling. SAM sits down.

SAM
Deal.

PATRICK smirks.

GRAVEYARD
EXT. GRAVEYARD – NIGHT

BOBBY sits at the foot of a grave while DEAN digs.

DEAN
Jawbone of a murderer. Great.

He sticks the shovel in the dirt, breathing hard.

DEAN
You know, this really sucks. How do we even know her spell's gonna work?

BOBBY
We don't. But we ain't got a Plan B. Now, less flappin' and more diggin'.

DEAN goes to move another scoop of dirt. Something cracks.

DEAN
Oh, God!

DEAN moans. BOBBY rolls his eyes.

DEAN
My elbows! I'm all creaky.

BOBBY
Hurry up, you crybaby.

DEAN
Pound it up your ass, Ironsides.

BOBBY
One little grave.

DEAN
Then you do it.

BOBBY
Fine. I'll hop right in.

DEAN
Well, least your legs are numb.

BOBBY
Shut up and dig, Grandma.

DEAN goes back to digging.

DEAN
Oh! Now it's my back!

BOBBY
Can you straighten up?

DEAN
Yeah, but a little sympathy wouldn't hurt.

BOBBY
Butt cheek tingling?

DEAN
Well, that's kind of personal.

BOBBY
So yeah?

DEAN looks up.

BOBBY
It's sciatica. You'll live. Keep digging.

DEAN
You know, Bobby, killing you is officially on my bucket list.

BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK is chewing on his toothpick. He has a glass of whiskey on the table, two cards in his hand, and several stacks of chips. Several chips are piled in the middle of the table next to the four of diamonds, a red court card, a black seven, the three of hearts, and a black two. PATRICK takes the toothpick out.

PATRICK
I like you, Sam. I do. You're smart, and your heart's clearly in the right place.

SAM doesn't answer.

PATRICK throws down his toothpick and drinks his whiskey.

PATRICK
I can tell a lot about a guy by looking.

SAM
You mean you're psychic.

PATRICK
No. That'd be cheating. I'm talking about good old-fashioned intuition.

SAM nods.

SAM
Right. Let's just play.

PATRICK drinks more whiskey.

PATRICK
We are playing.

He puts the glass down next to the toothpick.

PATRICK
Does your big brother know you're here?

SAM
Bet five.

SAM drops a stack of five chips on the pile. He has a lot fewer chips left than PATRICK.

PATRICK
Didn't think so.

PATRICK puts one stack of five on another and adds that stack to the pile.

PATRICK
I raise. Here you are, right? Trying to clean up their mess, and they still want to sit you at the kiddie table.

SAM looks down. PATRICK toys with a few chips.

PATRICK
You're not the little brother anymore, Sam.

SAM looks up.

PATRICK
Then again, maybe you are. You're in over your head here, Sam. I mean, you can keep making these moves—you know, playing it cautious, playing the percentages. But I'm still gonna kick your ass into the nursing home.

SAM
Does this armchair-psychology routine usually work for you?

PATRICK laughs.

PATRICK
You tell me. You're the one who's losing.

PATRICK chews his toothpick.

A little later, PATRICK shuffles the cards, chewing his toothpick. He has thirty or thirty-five chips and SAM fifteen or twenty. SAM plays with a few of his chips. LIA walks in. PATRICK puts down the toothpick. LIA leans down to kiss PATRICK. PATRICK looks at SAM and winks.

PATRICK
Little break?

BEHIND BAR
EXT. BEHIND BAR – NIGHT

SAM bursts out of doors that read "EMMIT'S PUB DELIVERY RING". He looks around and spots DEAN.

DEAN
How's it going in there?

SAM scoffs.

SAM
How do you think it's going? What about you? You have everything you need?

DEAN
We still need a little he-witch DNA.

SAM
He was chewing it.

SAM holds up a toothpick. DEAN takes it.

SAM
Hurry up, Dean. Please.

DEAN
All right. Just keep him busy. And, Sammy...don't lose.

SAM goes back inside. DEAN heads away, pausing to rub at his aching arm.

BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

SAM plays with his chips. PATRICK sits back down. LIA stands behind PATRICK, who pushes the deck of cards across the table.

BOBBY (voiceover)
Airmidh mi air maponus, dia—

BEHIND BAR
EXT. BEHIND BAR – NIGHT

A car drives in front of where BOBBY and DEAN are set up, BOBBY reading from LIA's paper while DEAN stands at the bowl full of burning things.

BOBBY
—na hogalachd. Gairmidh mi air sucellus, dia na time.

DEAN throws a handful of something in the flames, which flare up blue.

BOBBY
Till an-dràsda obair uile gu bheilair a bhith deànta. Mar sin bitheadh. Drop it in.

DEAN looks at the toothpick and adds it to the fire. A pause.

DEAN
Well? How do I look?

BOBBY doesn't reply; the truthful answer is 'eighty years old'.

BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK looks at SAM.

PATRICK.
Question.

PATRICK holds up a toothpick.

PATRICK
Is this what you meant to give your big brother?

SAM doesn't let his expression change. LIA flicks a glance at the toothpick.

PATRICK
The one you gave him never passed my lips. Won't do a scrap of good.

PATRICK throws the toothpick across the table.

PATRICK
I don't like cheating, Sam.

PATRICK stretches out his hand and clenches a fist. SAM stiffens, gasping for breath, while LIA watches. SAM puts a hand to his throat.

ACT FOUR
BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK is still choking SAM via witchcraft.

LIA
Stop it!

LIA grabs PATRICK's wrist.

LIA
Patrick, let him go!

PATRICK
He tried to kill us!

LIA
I did it! I gave him the spell!

PATRICK, shocked, releases SAM and looks up at LIA. SAM gasps in air.

PATRICK
What?

PATRICK stands up and touches LIA's face.

PATRICK
Why...why would you do that?

LIA
You know why.

LIA touches her silver locket.

LIA
You know.

PATRICK looks away for a moment, then sits down.

PATRICK
Keep. Playing.

LIA looks away. SAM glances at her.

BOBBY'S VAN
INT. BOBBY'S VAN – NIGHT

BOBBY is driving, DEAN next to him.

BOBBY
Everything we put in that spell was kosher.

DEAN
Yeah, everything except the damn toothpick.

BOBBY
You got to go get a speck of DNA. Strap on your track shoes.

DEAN
Oh, goody. More stairs.

BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

More than a dozen chips are piled next to the eight of hearts, the queens of clubs and diamonds, and the two of diamonds. PATRICK discards a card and deals the ace of clubs. SAM has his hands folded against his mouth.

PHONE CONVERSATION
INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT alternating with INT. BOBBY'S VAN – NIGHT

DEAN is on the phone with BOBBY while he looks around PATRICK and LIA's apartment.

DEAN
It's too damn clean in here. First witch I ever heard of didn't spew bodily fluids all over the place.

BOBBY
Toothbrush, comb—anything.

BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

SAM stacks five chips next to another five next to the pile.

PATRICK
Well, look at you—the percentage player betting the farm. Awful transparent of you, Sam. I mean, if I had a monster hand like you have, I'd trap you. But you get so excited, you bet yourself right out of a big pot.

PATRICK sniffs and picks up his face-down cards.

PATRICK
I fold.

He discards his cards.

PATRICK
Set of ladies, I'm guessing.

SAM collects a couple dozen chips and turns over his cards: the three of clubs and five of diamonds, for one pair of queens. SAM stacks his chips.

PATRICK
Nice bluff. If we had time, I could make a real player out of you.

SAM
I got time.

PATRICK grins.

PATRICK
Maybe. But I can't say the same for Dean. Your brother's gonna be dead soon.

SAM looks up.

PATRICK
And when I say 'soon'...

PATRICK leans forward.

PATRICK
I mean minutes.

SAM's expression changes, fearful, and he stands up. PATRICK extends a fist to yank him back down with witchcraft.

PATRICK
The game's not over till I say it is. Blinds.

PATRICK slaps down two chips and SAM one.

APARTMENT
INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

DEAN spots a wine glass on a table, still with a little wine left undrunk. He starts toward it.

DEAN
Sam...

DEAN slumps to the floor, groaning.

BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK deals two face-down cards apiece. SAM glances at his and adds another chip to the pot.

PATRICK
So.

PATRICK slaps down three cards and spreads them out: the ace of spades and fours of hearts and clubs. SAM eyes the cards.

PATRICK
When it's about your brother, you get so emotional, your brain just flies right out the window.

PATRICK illustrates with a hand gesture.

PATRICK
Good to know.

SAM
Go to hell.

INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

DEAN lies on the floor.

INT. BAR – NIGHT

SAM shoves all his chips into the middle.

SAM
I'm all in.

LIA glances at him. PATRICK sighs, checking his cards.

PATRICK
Don't do that, Sam.

SAM
I can't leave until it's over? Fine. It's over. Now, where's my brother?

PATRICK
Look, there's poker and then there's suicide.

SAM
Just play the hand.

INT. BOBBY'S VAN

BOBBY is on the phone with DEAN.

BOBBY
Dean? Dean, you there?

INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

DEAN lies on the floor, gasping weakly.

INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK adds all his chips to the pot.

PATRICK
Fine.

PATRICK discards a card and deals the seven of diamonds.

INT. BOBBY'S VAN – NIGHT

BOBBY is on the phone with DEAN.

BOBBY
Dean?!

INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK deals the nine of spades.

INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

DEAN lies on the floor.

INT. BAR – NIGHT

SAM and PATRICK stare each other down, SAM worried, PATRICK smug, LIA nervous.

INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

DEAN lies still.

INT. BOBBY'S VAN

BOBBY holds the phone, worried.

INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK turns over his face-down cards: aces of clubs and diamonds.

PATRICK
I'm sorry, kid. Aces full.

SAM looks at the cards.

INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

DEAN exhales.

INT. BAR – NIGHT

SAM lets out a breath. He glances at LIA.

SAM
You're crying.

LIA sniffles, looking away. PATRICK and SAM watch her.

SAM
For a witch, you're so nice, it's actually kind of creepy. It's okay.

SAM looks at PATRICK.

SAM
It was a great hand.

PATRICK moves to collect the chips: the only hands that can beat a full house with three aces are a four of a kind and a straight flush. The flop cards are three different suits, so he knows SAM cannot possibly have a straight flush, and he knows the odds are very slim that SAM has the remaining two fours.

SAM
Just—

PATRICK looks up.

SAM
—not as great as—

SAM turns over his face-down cards, the fours of diamonds and spades. He knew he had a four of a kind from the moment the flop cards were dealt; the only way to beat a four of a kind is with a straight flush, which he knew PATRICK could not possibly have.

SAM
—as four fours.

PATRICK glances up at SAM, then down at the cards. SAM takes a deep breath and lets it out. PATRICK leans back.

PATRICK
Well played. You know, that whole...going-out-of-your-head bit—very method.

SAM smirks.

PATRICK
Well, there's more to you than meets the eye.

PATRICK raises his glass. SAM nods.

SAM
Cash these in for Dean, please.

PATRICK nods. He sets down the glass.

PATRICK
With pleasure.

APARTMENT BUILDING
INT. BOBBY'S VAN – NIGHT

BOBBY is still on the phone.

BOBBY
Dean, you hear me? Damn it, Dean!

BOBBY spots something inside the building and turns to look. Someone comes out the door: it's DEAN, thirty again. He holds out his arms, grinning, and does a little dance as he approaches the van. BOBBY stares. DEAN jumps up, clicking his heels in the air.

BOBBY
Idjit.

EPILOGUE
BELOW BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

PATRICK and LIA sit at the poker table. PATRICK speaks in a whisper.

PATRICK
I can't do this, Lia.

LIA
Yes, you can.

PATRICK
Don't make me. I don't want to win.

LIA opens her locket. There are two photos inside.

LIA
I buried my daughter.

The right-hand photo is clearly decades old, of a very small child. The left-hand photo is much more recent, of an elderly woman.

LIA
And she looked like this.

LIA shakes her head.

LIA
It's not natural.

LIA closes the locket.

PATRICK
You knew. When you decided to come with me.

LIA looks down.

PATRICK
This is what you wanted. You're still young. You're so beautiful. You have me.

LIA
I miss my family. I'm sorry, Patrick.

PATRICK
I thought you loved me.

LIA
I do. Sweetheart, of course I do. I thought I was cut out for this, but I'm not.

PATRICK
I don't think I can do this without you.

LIA
You got on okay for a long time before you met me.

PATRICK
Check.

LIA pushes her stacks of poker chips, spilling them over the chips already in the middle of the table.

LIA
All in.

A long pause. PATRICK does the same with his chips.

PATRICK
All in.

The face-up cards are the nine of hearts, queen of diamonds, king of clubs, and six and seven of spades. PATRICK hesitates, then turns over his face-down cards, the king and queen of hearts, for two pair. Lia turns over her cards, the three of clubs and five of diamonds. LIA ages rapidly.

LIA
Thank you.

PATRICK puts his head in his hands.

MOTEL
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

BOBBY
No tricks—you actually beat the guy?

SAM spreads his arms.

BOBBY
How the hell?

SAM smirks.

SAM
Just lucky.

SAM heads for the door, passing DEAN, who's on the way in with a burger.

SAM
Hey. I'll see y'all guys later.

SAM grabs his jacket.

DEAN
Where you going?

SAM
Uh...mm, nowhere.

BOBBY and DEAN look at him.

SAM
A booster shot. Don't say it.

SAM leaves. DEAN comes in and puts his burger down. BOBBY groans.

BOBBY
Well, I guess we can get the van loaded.

DEAN holds up a finger and clears his throat.

DEAN
I shouldn't have called you an idiot.

BOBBY
Which time?

DEAN
I'm sorry. I mean, I actually—I, I—I get it. Getting old ain't a bachelor party. And dealing with the crap you got to deal with—

BOBBY
Don't you go on pity patrol.

DEAN
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just...I'm saying, you know, if I was in your shoes...

BOBBY
You'd never stop complaining.

DEAN stares for a moment.

DEAN
Fair enough. You're not useless, Bobby.

BOBBY
Okay. Good talk.

BOBBY goes to roll away. DEAN steps in his path.

DEAN
No, wait a minute. Listen to me.

DEAN sits down and sighs.

DEAN
You don't stop being a soldier 'cause you got wounded in battle. Okay? No matter what shape you're in, bottom line is, you're family. I don't know if you've noticed, but me and Sam, we don't have much left. I can't do this without you. I can't. So don't you dare think about checking out. I don't want to hear that again.

A long silence.

BOBBY
Okay.

DEAN
Okay. Good.

BOBBY
Thanks. Now, we done feeling our feelings? 'Cause I'd like to get out of this room before we both start growing lady parts.

DEAN
Yeah, we're done.

DEAN gets up. He picks up his burger, looks at it, and puts it back down. He picks up his bag.

DEAN
Let's go, Ironsides.

DEAN slings his bag over his shoulder and heads for the door.

BOBBY
Oh, that one's sticking, huh?

DEAN looks back, smiling, and leaves. BOBBY sighs.
