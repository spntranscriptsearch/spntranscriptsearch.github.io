NOW
INT. IMPALA – NIGHT


DEAN is driving, SAM in the passenger seat.


SAM
This makes no sense. I mean, how many angels fell – hundreds, thousands? And nobody sees anything. This is... Look at this. They're calling it a meteor shower. Seriously? What's going on, man? You okay?


DEAN
Me? Yes. I'm fine. It's just –


SAM
It's just we got a major freakin' crap fest on our hands. Yeah, tell me about it. Thousands of superpowered dicks touching down, and we got no idea where to start.


DEAN
Angels aren't our problem right now, okay? Or demons, or Metatron, or whatever the hell happened to Cas.


SAM
Why? Because we hugged it out in that church and – and now we're gonna go to Disneyland? Dean, you said it yourself – we're not gonna sleep till this is done.


DEAN
I know.


SAM
So, what's the problem?


DEAN
You. Look, there's no easy way to say this, okay? But something happened back there in the church. And I don't know what. I don't know why. You're dying, Sam.


We hear the sound of a heart beating loudly.


SAM
Shut up.


A recurring beep sounds in time with the heart beat.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


SAM lies with his eyes closed in a hospital bed. There is a tube in his nose and his arm is strapped to a beeping monitor. DEAN sits at his bedside, looking worried. DEAN turns his head to look at a television screen in the room, which shows pictures of the falling angels from 8.23 Sacrifice. The news headline reads “Global Meteor Shower.”


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


DEAN is looking at medical scans. SAM lies with his eyes closed in the hospital bed.


DOCTOR
The MRI shows massive internal burns affecting many of the major organs. Oxygen to the brain has been severely deprived. The coma is the result of the body doing everything in its limited power to protect itself from further harm.


DEAN
This wasn't supposed to happen.


DOCTOR
If your brother continues on this trajectory, the machines might keep him alive, but –


DEAN
He'll be dead.


DOCTOR
Technically, yes. I'm afraid so.


DEAN
So, there's – there's no recovery? I mean, there's no bounce-back. There's no nothing.


DOCTOR
I'm afraid that's in God's hands now.


DEAN
You're a doctor. You're a medical professional. You're trying to tell me that my brother's life is in God's hands? What, is that supposed to be a – a comfort?


DOCTOR
Mr. Dougherty –


DEAN
No, God has nothing to do with this equation at all.


DOCTOR
I didn't mean –


DEAN
That's not good enough.


DEAN walks out of the hospital room and into a corridor. He sees a sign pointing to the hospital chapel.


INT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL – DAY


DEAN
Cas, are you there? Sammy's hurt. He's hurt, uh – he's hurt pretty bad. And, um... I know you think that I'm pissed at you, okay? But I don't care that the angels fell. So whatever you did or didn't do, it doesn't matter, okay? We'll work it out. Please, man, I need you here.


DEAN looks around. The chapel contains six other people, all sitting quietly.


DEAN
Screw it. Okay, listen up. This one goes out to any angel with their ears on. This is Dean Winchester... And I need your help.


INT. HOME KITCHEN – DAY


A MAN IN A SUIT, a WOMAN and two children are having breakfast around a kitchen bench.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
This is Dean Winchester...


The MAN IN A SUIT looks up.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
And I need your help.


EXT. – DAY


People are getting off a bus.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
The deal is this – Linwood Memorial Hospital...


A TALL MAN pauses and looks off into the distance.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
...Randolph, New York.


INT. HOME KITCHEN – DAY


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
The first one who can help me gets my help in return...


The MAN IN A SUIT gets up and leaves the table.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
...and you know that ain't nothin'.


WOMAN
Honey?


EXT. FIELD – DAY


A FARMER walks rapidly across the field towards his tractor.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
Hell, it's no secret that we haven't always seen eye to eye.


The FARMER starts the tractor and drives away.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
But you know that I am good for my word.


EXT. – DAY


The TALL MAN is still standing by the bus, listening.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
And, uh, I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't needing, so...


The TALL MAN gets back on the bus.


INT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL – DAY


DEAN finishes his prayer and looks down. A tear falls from his eye.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


SAM still lies in the hospital bed.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
Look, just because you're dying doesn't mean you're...


INT. COMA IMPALA – NIGHT


DEAN
... dead – not yet, okay? We've jimmied ourselves out of worse. We're gonna fight this. I got the plan. You just got to hang on. You hear me?


SAM
Absolutely.


DEAN
You think I'm lying?


SAM
Pretty much, yeah.


DEAN
You understand that we're not really in this car right now. We are in your head, and you're in a coma and are dying.


SAM
How do you know that?


DEAN
Because I'm you and you're you. All of this is you. We're in your head!


SAM
You're serious. [exhales] The whole reason I stopped doing the trials was not to die.


DEAN
And the next time we see Naomi or Metatron or whoever is to blame for this, we will get some justice, but for right now, we got to fight this, man.


SAM
Okay. All right, what's the plan?


DEAN
I'm working on it.


SAM
What does that mean? I'm kind of dying here, apparently.


DEAN
It means I'm working on it, all right?


SAM
The thing is, if I am dying – and I believe you. I do. But if you're you but you're really me and you're the part of me that wants to fight to live...


DEAN
Yes. I have no idea what you just said, but continue.


SAM
But if you don't have any idea how I'm supposed to fight, then am I supposed to be fighting at all?


DEAN
Are you serious?


BOBBY
Hell, yes, he's serious.


BOBBY has appeared in the back seat.


BOBBY
And if you ask me, I think the kid's got a good point.


EXT. FOREST ROAD – DAY

LONGMONT, COLORADO


CASTIEL is walking down the road, hearing ringing noises and voices. He narrowly avoids being hit by a pick-up by throwing himself to the side of the road. The pick-up screeches to a halt and a MAN gets out.


MAN
Hey, buddy. You okay?


CASTIEL looks at his bloody palm.


CASTIEL
It hurts.


MAN
What the hell you doing in the middle of the road like that?


CASTIEL
I heard angels.


MAN
How about we get you some water, hmm?


CASTIEL
I, uh, I don't drink water.


MAN
Dehydration's a real bitch up here, mister.


CASTIEL
A phone. Do you have a phone?


MAN
No signal up here. How about a lift, hmm?


CASTIEL
Yes. Good. I would fly, but I – I have no wings, not anymore.


MAN
Right.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


We see a close-up of SAM’s face. He is still unconscious.


DEAN (VOICE-OVER)
Sam wants to die, and you think he's got a point?


INT. COMA IMPALA – NIGHT


SAM
Okay, I don't want to die. I asked if maybe I was supposed to –


DEAN
Shut it, Sam. [to BOBBY] You – go. Oh, and, uh, before you throw me under the bus, you're welcome for the hell rescue.


BOBBY
Hey, first of all, you didn't rescue jack, half-wit. Sam did. Second of all, Sam, you're in a coma. Now, suck as that may, sometimes that's just the way things go.


DEAN
What are you talking about? There's always a way. You taught us that.


BOBBY
Oh, you mean like the way one of you idjits does some "bass-ackwards" crazy thing to beat death, like sell your soul?


DEAN
Exactly like selling my soul.


BOBBY
Yeah, like that worked so well the last time.


DEAN
[dismissively, waving a hand] Oh!


SAM
Enough! Both of you! I can't hear myself think!


DEAN
Well, you're not actually buying this, are you?


BOBBY
Excuse me. Are you dead? Because I am, and maybe I'm here because I'm the part of Sam that actually knows what the hell he's talking about.


DEAN
Well, I'm in the front seat because Sam put me here because he wants to fight. Right?


BOBBY suddenly appears in the front seat between SAM and DEAN.


BOBBY
Well... that just got real uncomfortable. See ya, Dean.


BOBBY puts a hand on SAM’s shoulder.


DEAN
Sam, don't you dare –


EXT. COMA FOREST – DAY


SAM and BOBBY are standing in the forest.


BOBBY
Yip, yip, yip. Am I right?


SAM
Honestly, Bobby, I – I don't know what's right.


BOBBY puts an arm around SAM’s shoulder.


BOBBY
Let's walk.


EXT. GAS STATION – DAY


The pick-up pulls up across the street from the gas station. CASTIEL gets out.


MAN
Hey.


The MAN holds out some bills.


CASTIEL
No, I can't take your money.


MAN
For the phone. And a sandwich if they have one.


CASTIEL
It's okay. I don't eat.


A YOUNG WOMAN is watching them from the back seat of a car across the street.


MAN
You'll figure something. Hmm?


CASTIEL takes the bills and some change.


MAN
Take care, kid.


The MAN drives away. CASTIEL walks past the YOUNG WOMAN in the car to the phone outside the gas station. A BIKER is talking on the phone.


BIKER (on phone)
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.


CASTIEL
Hang up the phone.


BIKER (on phone)
Right.


The BIKER covers the phone and turns to face CASTIEL.


BIKER
Excuse me?


CASTIEL
This is an emergency. I don't want to hurt you.


BIKER
[on phone] Hold on, hon. [to CASTIEL] Sure you do. Hurt me.


CASTIEL
I'm sorry.


CASTIEL puts two fingers to the BIKER’s forehead. Nothing happens. CASTIEL looks perplexed and grips the top of the BIKER’s head. The BIKER pushes CASTIEL’s arm away.


BIKER
I'm gonna finish this call. Then I'm gonna stab you.


CASTIEL turns and walks away. The YOUNG WOMAN from the car blocks his path.


YOUNG WOMAN
I know you.


CASTIEL
I don't think so.


YOUNG WOMAN
Castiel. We met in Heaven. My name is Hael.


CASTIEL
You're an angel.


YOUNG WOMAN
Am I? What's an angel without its wings?


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


SAM is still unconscious. A WOMAN enters. DEAN, who was leaning against the window frame, stands up.


DEAN
Hi. I'm just gonna break the ice. Are you an angel?


WOMAN
Sometimes I wish I were. My name is Kim Schortz, and I'm a grief counselor here at the hospital.


DEAN
Right. Yeah. Uh... Sorry. I'm just tired. Well, all due respect, but, uh, I'm not grieving – not yet at least, so –


KIM
I'm afraid, as hard as this may be, this might be a good time to talk... about the inevitable.


DEAN
Look, I'm sure you're a nice person and that you mean well, but "inevitable" – that's a fightin' word where I come from. There's always a way.


KIM
And I am a prayerful woman who believes in miracles as much as the next, but I also know how to read an EEG. And unless you're telling me you have a direct line to those angels that you were looking for –


DEAN
Yeah, no, I, uh... Guess I don't. But I might have something better. I got the King of Hell in my trunk.


DEAN leaves the room.


KIM
Uh, is – is that... I'm sorry. Is that a metaphor?


EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEAN walks to the IMPALA and raps on the trunk.


DEAN
Crowley, listen up, you son of a bitch. One for yes, two for no. You alive?


There is no response.


DEAN
Come on, don't be a pouter.


CROWLEY, inside the trunk, hits it once.


DEAN
There we go.


The MAN IN A SUIT grabs DEAN by the back of the neck and holds and angel knife against his throat.


MAN IN A SUIT
You prayed?


DEAN
Yeah, for help.


MAN IN A SUIT
Yes. You'll be helping me.

ACT TWO
EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY


The MAN IN A SUIT forces DEAN down against the IMPALA’s trunk.


MAN IN A SUIT
If you lie to me, Dean Winchester, I will rip your throat out. Where is Castiel?


DEAN
Who's asking?


MAN IN A SUIT
Try every angel who was ejected from their home.


DEAN
Oh. Oh, well, in that case, I have no clue.


The MAN IN A SUIT slams DEAN against the IMPALA’s trunk twice. He raises the angel knife, but the TALL MAN from the bus catches his arm from behind.


TALL MAN
Easy there, brother. This young man has prayed for our assistance. Are we creatures of wrath or compassion? I would argue the latter.


MAN IN A SUIT
Forgive me, brother. I don't recognize you.


TALL MAN
Happy to make your re-acquaintance. After you disarm.


The MAN IN A SUIT lets go of DEAN and holds up his hands placatingly, then punches the TALL MAN.


TALL MAN
Come, now. Is that any way to treat a brother injured in the fall?


THE MAN IN A SUIT and TALL MAN fight. The angel knife falls to the ground. The MAN IN A SUIT flings the TALL MAN into a vehicle, breaking the window glass. DEAN stabs the MAN IN A SUIT with the angel knife. He dies in a blinding flash of white light.


DEAN
Who are you?


TALL MAN
[still leaning against the vehicle with blood on his face] Never mind me. You're Dean Winchester. I heard your prayer, and I am here to help.


The TALL MAN passes out and slides to the ground.


DEAN
Okay.


EXT. GAS STATION – DAY


CASTIEL and HAEL are sitting near the gas pumps.


HAEL
It was a normal day, and then just... dark. And then I was just... falling. How could that happen?


CASTIEL
I don't know.


HAEL
Your grace – it's... gone?


CASTIEL
I do still hear angel radio, though.


HAEL
Then you've heard them – our brothers and sisters, many still circling for vessels, most just... so afraid.


CASTIEL
There's nothing to be afraid of. I can assure you.


HAEL
But Heaven – there was order. There was purpose.


CASTIEL
Well, believe it or not, there may be something even better down here.


HAEL
I don't understand.


CASTIEL
There's opportunity for you, the others who have fallen, to do finally do what you would like to do – not just what you've been told.


HAEL
And what would I like to do?


CASTIEL
You tell me. If you could do anything, what would it be?


HAEL
There's a place. I built it when I was last here – many years ago. A grand canyon.


CASTIEL
The Grand Canyon, yes.


HAEL
I - I would like to see that.


CASTIEL
Let's go see the Grand Canyon, then.


INT. GARAGE – DAY


The TALL MAN wakes on the ground in a circle of fire. DEAN walks around outside the flames.


DEAN
You want to help? Start with a name.


TALL MAN
Ezekiel.


DEAN
All right, Ezekiel. How do I know you're not hunting me or Castiel like the other angels?


EZEKIEL
Oh, I'm sure there are many angels who are. Many more are on their way here, most likely.


DEAN
How do you know that?


EZEKIEL
You put out an open prayer like that...


DEAN
I must really be desperate.


EZEKIEL gets to his feet.


EZEKIEL
Believe it or not, some of us still do believe in our mission. And that means we believe in Castiel...and you.


DEAN
You said you were hurt during the fall.


EZEKIEL
I was. Entangling with my brother back there did me no favors. But what strength I have left, I offer to you.


EXT. COMA FOREST – DAY


SAM and BOBBY walk through the forest.


SAM
I want to fight. I do. But I just feel like...


BOBBY
Like you got nothing to swing at? Like you're punching at shadows? You got to let go of fightin' and scratchin' and lookin' for loopholes, 'cause that ain't happenin'.


SAM
So – so, what? I - I - I just die?


BOBBY
Just die? All the good you've done, all the people you've saved, all the sacrifices you've made? You've saved the world, son. How many people can say that? How many people can say that they have left this godforsaken hunk of dirt that much a better place? What you call dyin' I call leavin' a legacy.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


SAM is still unconscious. EZEKIEL puts a hand on SAM’s chest.


DEAN
You still able to cure things after the fall?


EZEKIEL
Yes, I should be, but... he's so weak.


DEAN’s phone rings and he answers.


DEAN (on phone)
Who is this?


CASTIEL (on phone)
Dean.


DEAN walks out of SAM’s room and into the hospital corridor. The scene alternates between DEAN in the hospital and CASTIEL at the gas station.


DEAN (on phone)
Cas, what the hell's going on?


CASTIEL (on phone)
Metatron tricked me. It wasn't angel trials. It was a spell. I wanted you to know that.


DEAN (on phone)
Okay. That's great, but we've got ourselves a problem.


CASTIEL (on phone)
What's wrong?


DEAN (on phone)
Sam. He's, um – they say he's dying.


CASTIEL (on phone)
What happened?


DEAN (on phone)
I don't know. I mean, first he was okay, and then he wasn't. And I – have you heard my prayers? I've been praying to you all night.


CASTIEL (on phone)
Dean, Metatron – he – he took my grace.


DEAN (on phone)
What?


CASTIEL (on phone)
Don't worry about me. What are you doing for Sam?


DEAN (on phone)
Uh, everything I can. There's actually another angel in there working on him right now.


CASTIEL (on phone)
What other angel?


DEAN (on phone)
Um, his name is Ezekiel. He's cool. I mean, I think he is.


CASTIEL (on phone)
Ezekiel. Yes. [He smiles.] He's a good soldier. He should be able to help until I get there.


DEAN (on phone)
Wait, no, no, no. No, hey, that's not an option.


CASTIEL (on phone)
It might be a few days, but –


DEAN (on phone)
Hey, Cas, listen to me. There are angels out there, okay? And they – they're looking for you, and they're pissed.


CASTIEL (on phone)
Not all of them, Dean. Some are just looking for direction. Some are just lost.


DEAN (on phone)
What are you talking about?


CASTIEL (on phone)
I met one. I think I can help her, Dean.


DEAN (on phone)
No, Cas, I know you want to help, okay? I do, but helping angels is what got you in trouble in the first place. Now, I'm begging you – for once, look out for yourself. Until we figure out what the hell is going on, trust nobody.


CASTIEL (on phone)
And do what? Just abandon them all?


DEAN (on phone)
Damn it, Cas. You hearing yourself? There's a war on, and it's on you. There's thousands of them out th– You said you lost your grace, right? That means you're human. That means you bleed and you eat and you sleep and all the things you never had to worry about before.


CASTIEL (on phone)
I'm fine, Dean.


There are rumbling sounds at the hospital.


DEAN (on phone)
Whoa.


CASTIEL (on phone)
What's going on?


DEAN (on phone)
I think we got more company. Look, get your ass to the bunker alone. You hear me?


CASTIEL (on phone)
Dean.


DEAN (on phone)
Go, Cas!


CASTIEL (on phone)
Dean.


DEAN hangs up and goes back into SAM’s room.

DEAN
One of yours?


EZEKIEL
Trying to secure a vessel. We need to move.


DEAN
No, no. If we move him, he dies.


EZEKIEL
If we stay, we could all die.


DEAN picks up a whiteboard marker and draws an Enochian symbol on the walls.


EXT. GAS STATION – DAY


HAEL
I don't understand. I'll come with you. We can see your friend together.


CASTIEL
It's complicated. There could be trouble. It's – it's best if I go alone. My – my friend – he... needs my help.


HAEL
I need help.


CASTIEL
You can do this, Hael. This is your chance to help people, to help yourself. I'm sorry.


CASTIEL turns away. HAEL picks up a length of wood and hits him over the head. CASTIEL falls to the ground unconscious.


ACT THREE
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


The walls and the back of the door are now covered in Enochian symbols.


DEAN
Long as these are up, no angels are coming in. No one's coming out. You gonna be okay with these?


EZEKIEL
I'll manage.


There is a ringing noise that only EZEKIEL may be able to hear.


DEAN
What?


EZEKIEL
They're here.


DEAN
Okay. Do not open this door for anybody but me. [He points to SAM.] Save him, you hear me?


DEAN leaves the room and runs down the corridor as glass flies from every window. He pulls the fire alarm.


DEAN
Everybody out! Now! Get out!


EXT. ROAD – DAY


HAEL is driving down the road with CASTIEL in the passenger seat.


INT. CAR – DAY


CASTIEL wakes in pain in the passenger seat. He puts a hand to the back of his head and finds he is bleeding. HAEL’s angel knife is on her lap.


HAEL
You understand that I couldn't just let you leave. I'd be lost without you, Castiel.


CASTIEL
Yes, I'm... beginning to see that.


HAEL
It's the least I could ask of you, considering, well... This is all your fault, isn't it? Making the angels fall? So, we'll drive to the Grand Canyon, you'll tell me more about humans, and I'll show you what I'm capable of. We're going to become more than just friends, Castiel. We're going to become one.


CASTIEL
You want to possess me.


HAEL
Your vessel is strong. [She shows him a large spreading bruise on her shoulder.] This one won't hold me much longer. You were right, Castiel. With us together, I think I could learn to like it here.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEAN approaches KIM, who is lying on the floor.


DEAN
Hey. You got to get out of here. [He helps her up.] Come on. Come on.


The FARMER comes around a corner, carrying an angel knife.


DEAN
Whoa. [to KIM] Stay behind me.


DEAN pulls out his own knife. KIM punches him from behind, then grabs him by the throat and lifts him off the ground.


KIM
Or not.


EXT. COMA FOREST – DAY


SAM and BOBBY are still walking through the forest. There is a small cabin at the end of the path.


BOBBY
There it is.


BOBBY stops walking. SAM continues on a few paces, then turns to face BOBBY.


BOBBY
Everything inside you need to help you on your way. Go on, son. I'll be waiting for you with a couple of cold ones.


DEAN stabs BOBBY from behind. BOBBY falls to the ground with a knife protruding from his chest, then vanishes.


DEAN
Sorry, old man.


SAM
Dean, are you insane?!


DEAN
Come on, Sammy. Bobby was the part of you that wants to die. I know it stings, but he had to go.


SAM
No. You have to go. When are you gonna realize it's over?! There's nothing to fight for!


DEAN
No, see, I know you don't believe that.


SAM
Really? Then what's your plan, Dean?


DEAN
My plan? [He punches Sam, who reels back.] My plan is to fight! [He pushes SAM and hits him again.] My plan is to try! My plan [he punches SAM again] is to give a damn! [He holds SAM by the front of his jacket.] Are you telling me there's nothing? Huh? You telling me there's nothing to fight for, that there's nothing to hope for?!


SAM
No. I'm telling you there is. You might not like it. You might not accept it, but it's in there. It's in that house.


DEAN
You know what's in that house! Now, I can't help you if you ain't willing to fight for yourself!


SAM
I know. [He puts his hands on DEAN’s arms so that DEAN lets go of his jacket.] It's okay. It's what I want.


SAM pats DEAN twice on the cheek. DEAN disappears. SAM stands breathing heavily for a moment, then walks towards the cabin.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


KIM and the FARMER are dragging DEAN down the corridor, which is covered in broken glass. They drop him on the floor.


KIM
Let me make this easy – tell me where Castiel is, or your brother's gonna wish he were dead.


DEAN
Yeah, good luck getting past the warding.


KIM
But we will.


The FARMER breaks the glass around a fire axe. KIM hauls DEAN upright.


KIM
And when we do, I'm gonna strip off all his skin, and you're gonna watch.


DEAN
Bite me.


KIM punches DEAN, sending him flying to the ground. He groans, laughs and gets to his knees.


DEAN
Anybody ever tell you you hit like an angel?


KIM kicks DEAN. He falls backwards and lies still.


EXT. COMA CABIN – DAY


SAM slowly pushes open the cabin door.


INT. COMA CABIN – DAY


SAM enters the cabin, slowly. DEATH is standing by the fireplace looking at the flames. He turns.


DEATH
Hello, Sam. I've been waiting for you.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


The axe breaks through the door in the middle of an Enochian symbol. EZEKIEL sits by SAM’s bed.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEAN, his face bloody, is slammed against a wall in the corridor. He slides down the wall to the floor, his back to the angels. The FARMER pulls the axe out of the door. DEAN holds up a hand.


DEAN
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll tell you where Cas is. I just have one question.


KIM
Ask.


DEAN
If Heaven is locked, then where do you go when I do this?


DEAN slams his hand down onto an angel banishing sigil he’s drawn on the floor using his blood. White light floods the corridor.


KIM
Aah!


When the light fades, the angels are gone.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


DEAN enters SAM’s room. The monitor is beeping loudly. EZEKIEL is sitting by the bed with a hand to his side.


DEAN
What the hell's happening?


EZEKIEL
This just started. And the warding. I'm afraid I'm weaker than I thought.


DEAN grabs a marker and starts crossing out the sigils on the walls.


EZEKIEL
I am sorry, Dean.


DEAN
No. No, no, no. No, we had a deal, okay? I fight. You save.


EZEKIEL
And would that I could. I'm just afraid it's too late.


DEAN
Are you kidding me? Are you saying there's no way to save my brother's life?


EZEKIEL
No good ways, I'm afraid.


DEAN
Well, what are the bad ones? We're out of options here, man. Good or bad, let me hear them.


EZEKIEL
I cannot promise, but there is a chance I can fix your brother from the inside.


DEAN
From the inside. So, what, you gonna open him up? [EZEKIEL shakes his head.] What, possession? You want to possess Sam?


EZEKIEL
I told you.


DEAN
No way.


EZEKIEL
Understood. It's your call.


DEAN
No, it's Sam's call. There's no way in hell he'd say yes to being possessed by anything.


EZEKIEL
He would rather die.


DEAN nods ruefully. EZEKIEL gets painfully to his feet and waves a hand in front of the monitor, silencing it.


EZEKIEL
I'll leave you two alone, then.


EZEKIEL heads for the door.


DEAN
Wait.


ACT FOUR
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


DEAN
If I consider this – and I mean just consider it – I need something, man. You got to prove to me how bad he is.


EZEKIEL puts a hand on SAM’s forehead.


EZEKIEL
Close your eyes.


DEAN does so. EZEKIEL puts his other hand on DEAN’s forehead.


DEATH (VOICE-OVER)
I must admit, when I heard it was you...


INT. COMA CABIN – DAY


DEATH and SAM are sitting in armchairs near the fire.


DEATH
Well, I had to come myself.


SAM
I bet you get off on this.


DEATH
Perhaps. But not in the way you assume. I consider it to be quite the honor to be collecting the likes of Sam Winchester. I try so hard not to pass judgment at times like this – not my bag, you see, but you... Well played, my boy.


SAM
I need to know one thing.


DEATH
Yes.


SAM
If I go with you... can you promise that this time it will be final? That if I'm dead, I stay dead. Nobody can reverse it, nobody can deal it away... and nobody else can get hurt because of me.


DEATH
I can promise that.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


EZEKIEL takes his hand away from DEAN’s forehead.


DEAN
What the hell you doing, Sam?


EZEKIEL
As you can see, there's not much time.


DEAN
I know. Damn it. I know.


EXT. ROAD – DAY


HAEL and CASTIEL drive. CASTIEL looks at the angel knife on HAEL’s lap and notices that she is not wearing a seat belt. He puts his own seat belt on, then grabs the wheel and steers the car into some large concrete blocks.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


DEAN
How will it work?


EZEKIEL is still holding his side.


EZEKIEL
Mutual benefit, I suppose. I heal Sam while healing myself.


DEAN
And when he's healed?


EZEKIEL
I leave. It's the best of a bad situation, Dean.


DEAN
Even if I said yes, it doesn't mean squat. Sam will never say yes – not to you.


EZEKIEL
But he would say yes to you.


EXT. ROAD – DAY


CASTIEL wakes in the car, held in place by his seat belt. There is a large hole in the windshield on HAEL’s side. CASTIEL groans as he gets out of the car. He walks over to HAEL, whose face is covered with blood and broken glass. He picks up the angel knife from the ground.


CASTIEL
I don't want to hurt you.


One of HAEL’s legs is bent at 90 degrees in a direction it’s not meant to go and both her knees are very bloody.


CASTIEL
I didn't want to hurt any of them. I want to help you. I will devote my life to helping you all.


HAEL
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? Help angels? After what you did? They don't want your help, Castiel. They want your head.


CASTIEL
You're wrong. I'm one of you. I will never stop being one of you.


HAEL
Don't you get it? Together, I can protect you, Castiel.


CASTIEL
I don't need your – I don't want your protection.


CASTIEL turns and walks away.


HAEL
If you leave me here in this broken girl [CASTIEL stops] I swear it, Castiel – I will tell them where you are. And they will hunt you. Until their last breath, they will seek revenge on the angel that did this, who destroyed Heaven.


CASTIEL
Stop.


HAEL
They will seek a vengeance on you that will make God striking down Lucifer seem like child's play.


CASTIEL
Stop it.


HAEL
I will go on angel radio and tell them everything unless you open your heart and say yes.


CASTIEL stabs her in the chest with the angel knife. White light flares from her mouth, eyes and the knife wound as she dies.


INT. COMA CABIN – DAY


DEATH stands up.


DEATH
It's time, Sam. Shall we?


SAM stands up to follow DEATH.


DEAN
Hold on.


SAM
Dean.


DEAN
It's okay, Sam. [to DEATH] I, uh, would have brought cronuts, but time is short, so...


DEATH
By all means.


SAM
What's going on?


DEAN
I found a plan.


SAM
It's too late. I'm going.


DEAN
No, no. No, no. Listen to me.


SAM
Why are you even here? I'm not fighting this anymore!


DEAN
You have to fight this! I can fix this, okay? But not if you shut me out. [to DEATH] It's not his time.


DEATH
That's for Sam to decide.


DEAN
Sam, listen to me. I made you a promise in that church. You and me, come whatever. Well, hell, if this ain't whatever... But you got to let me in, man. You got to let me help. There ain't no me if there ain't no you.


SAM looks at DEATH, then back to DEAN.


SAM
What do I do?


DEAN
Is that a yes?


SAM looks at DEATH again and back to DEAN.


SAM
Yes.


DEAN
Come on.


DEAN puts a hand on SAM’s shoulder and morphs into EZEKIEL. SAM looks alarmed. White light floods the room.


ACT FIVE
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


A man is sweeping glass in the corridor outside SAM’s room.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY


The DOCTOR enters SAM’s room and sees the Enochian sigils on the walls. EZEKIEL is on the bed.


DOCTOR
Who are you? What the hell is going on here?


TALL MAN (formerly possessed by EZEKIEL)
I have no idea.


EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEAN and SAM are walking away from the hospital.


DEAN
So? How's it look in there?


EZEKIEL IN SAM’S BODY
Not good. There is much work to be done.


SAM’s body is moving much more stiffly than normal and he speaks in EZEKIEL's manner.


DEAN
Yeah, but he's gonna wake up, right?


EZEKIEL IN SAM’S BODY
He will.


DEAN
So, what he does – what, is he gonna feel you inside, triaging his spleen?


EZEKIEL IN SAM’S BODY
He will not feel me, no. There is no reason for Sam to know I'm in here at all.


DEAN
You're joking. No, this is – this is too big.


EZEKIEL IN SAM’S BODY
And what will he do if you do tell him he is possessed by an angel?


DEAN
Well, he'll have to understand.


EZEKIEL IN SAM’S BODY
And if he does not? Without his acceptance, Sam can eject me at any time, especially with me so weak. And if Sam does eject me, he will die.


DEAN
Then we keep it a secret for now. Or until Sam's well enough that he doesn't need an angelic pacemaker or I find a way to tell him. I - I... As for him being in a hospital, I'll have to figure something out.


EZEKIEL IN SAM’S BODY
I can erase it all, if you like. He will not remember any of this.


INT. LAUNDROMAT – NIGHT


CASTIEL, his face and clothes bloody, enters the Laundromat. A woman with white hair is taking clothes out of a dryer. CASTIEL puts quarters on the top of a washing machine. He takes off his trenchcoat, suit jacket, tie and shirt, puts everything he’s removed into the washing machine and stands in his boxers and bare feet. He puts a coin into a slot in the machine, but pauses as he catches sight of a vending machine. A sign on the side reads “For a better wash, do not overload the machines.” He takes the coin back out of the slot and looks undecided as he stares at the products in the vending machine. He looks down at his bloody clothes in the washing machine, then at a basket of clothes nearby.


CUT TO:


EXT. LAUNDROMAT – NIGHT


CASTIEL, wearing clothes from the basket, leaves the Laundromat holding a bottle of water. He drains the bottle.


INT. IMPALA – NIGHT


DEAN is driving, SAM asleep in the passenger seat. SAM wakes.


SAM
Where are we?


DEAN
Whoa. Sam?


SAM
What?


DEAN
Okay, take – take it easy. How you, uh – how you feeling?


SAM
Tired. Like I – like I slept for a week.


DEAN
Well, try a day. You've been out since the sky was spittin' angels.


SAM
What the hell happened?


DEAN
What do you remember?


SAM
The church, feeling like crap, the angels falling, and that's it.


DEAN
But you're feeling good?


SAM
Yeah. I mean, I just, um... You've been driving around with me passed out in the passenger's seat for a day?


DEAN
Oh, I mean, I stopped, you know, let a few Japanese tourists take some pictures. Nobody got too handsy. I knew you'd pull through. I meant what I said at the church. You're capable of anything, Sam, and hell if you didn't prove me right.


SAM
Good. 'Cause we got work to do.
