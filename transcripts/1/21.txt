TEASER
INTERIOR. CHURCH

BLUE EARTH. MINNESOTA

A Pastor is at his pulpit. He looks up when a wind ruffles his hair and the candles on the alter.

MEG enters the chuch.

PASTOR
Good Morning. Can I help you?

The Pastor comes down from the pulpit. MEG walks forward and sits in a pew.

MEG
I kinda...I need to talk.

PASTOR
Well that's what I'm here for.

MEG
I've done some things. Not good things.

PASTOR
Well there's always forgiveness for us if we seek it.

MEG
For everyone? Are you sure?.

PASTOR
I like to say salvation was created for sinners. Tell me what's on your mind.

MEG
Well. I've lied. A lot. I've stolen. I've lusted. And the other day I met this man. A nice guy, you know? We had a really good chat, sort of like this....then I slit his throat and ripped his heart out through his chest.

MEG blinks and her eyes go black. The Pastor jerks back.

MEG
Does that make me a bad person?

PASTOR
(Backing away) I know what you are. You can't be here. This is hallowed ground.

MEG
(Standing) Please. Maybe that works in the minor leagues. But not with me.

The Pastor runs for the door behind the pulpit and down the stairs. He unlocks a door and rushes inside, sliding a ready to go barricade across the door. He turns to a well stocked hunter's chest of weapons and starts scrambling for something. MEG kicks open the door with ease, breaking the wood barricading it. The Pastor starts, then throws a knife covered in Sigils at MEG'S head. She catches it easily.

MEG
You throw like a girl.

PASTOR
What do you want.

MEG
The Winchesters.

PASTOR
I haven't spoken to John Winchestor in over a year. You're wasting your time. Even if I did know where they were, I'd never tell you.

MEG
I know.

MEG slits his throat with his own knife and he falls back into a chair, gasping, then dying. MEG smiles and walks away.

ACT ONE
MANNING, COLORADO.

The camera pans across a motel room and JOHN'S research. The walls are covered with information on the yellow eyed demon. Weather charts, hieroglyphics, pictures, newspaper articles, written notes, a shelf of books and more.

JOHN sits at a paper strewn desk, the Colt in front of him. SAM leans against the counter while DEAN paces.

JOHN
So this is it. This is everything I know. Look, our whole lives we been searching for this demon right? Not a trace, just...nothing. Until about a year ago. For the first time I picked up a trail.

DEAN
And that's when you took off.

JOHN
Yeah. That's right. The demon must have come out of hiding, or hibernation.

DEAN
All right so what's this trail you found?

JOHN
It starts in Arizona, then New Jersey, California. Houses burned down to the ground. It's going after families, just like it went after us.

SAM
Families with infants?

JOHN
Yeah. The night of the kid's six-month birthday.

SAM
I was six months old that night?

JOHN
Exactly six months.

SAM
So basically, this demon is going after these kids for some reason. The same way it came for me? So Mom's death...Jessica. It's all because of me?

DEAN
We don't know that Sam.

SAM
Oh really? Cause I'd say we're pretty damn sure Dean.

DEAN
(Frustrated) For the last time, what happened to them was not your fault.

SAM
(Shouting) Right. It's not my fault but it's my problem.

DEAN
No it's not your problem it's our problem!

JOHN
(Standing) Okay. That's enough.

Everyone takes a breath and calms down.

SAM
So why's he doing it. What does he want?

JOHN
Look I wish I had more answers, I do. I've always been one step behind it. Look, I've never gotten there in time to save....

JOHN looks down, unhappy.

DEAN
All right so how do we find it..before it hits again.

JOHN
There's signs. It took me a while to see the pattern but it's there in the days before these fires signs crop up in an area. Cattle deaths, temperature fluctations, electrical storms. And then I went back and checked...and...

DEAN
These things happened in Lawrence.

JOHN
(Nodding) A week before your mother died. And in Palo Alto...before Jessica. And these signs, they're starting again.

SAM
Where.

JOHN

Salvation Iowa.

...........................

EXTERIOR. ROAD.

JOHN'S truck speeds along a misty road, followed closely by the Impala. After a few moments he pulls off to the side, the Impala follows and everyone springs out of their seats.

JOHN
God damn it!

DEAN
What is it?

JOHN
Son of a bitch.

DEAN
What is it!

JOHN
I just got a call from Caleb.

DEAN
Is he okay?

JOHN
He's fine. Jim Murphy's dead.

SAM
Pastor Jim? How?

JOHN
His throat was slashed. He bled out. Caleb said they found traces of sulfur at Jim's place.

DEAN
A demon. (JOHN nods) The Demon?

JOHN
I don't know. Could be he just got careless, he slipped up. Maybe the demon knows we're getting close.

DEAN
What do we do?

JOHN
Now we act like every second counts. There's two hospitals and a health centre in this county. We split up, cover more ground. I want records. I want a list of every infant that's going to be six months old in the next week.

SAM
Dad that could be dozens of kids. How do we know which one's the right one?

JOHN
We check em all that's how. You got any better ideas?

SAM
No sir.

JOHN nods at them and they all turn back to their cars. JOHN stops, leaning on his trunk. DEAN turns back as he opens his door and pauses.

DEAN
Dad?

JOHN
(upset) Yeah. It's Jim. You know, I can't....(his face hardens) This ends, now. I'm ending it. I don't care what it takes.

They all get back in their cars and pull back onto the road, speeding into the distance.

.......................

JOHN pulls up in front of 'Salvation Children's Hospital'. He opens the container between the seats and shuffled through the number of IDs there, selecting one and pinning it to his jacket.

......................

SAM is sitting in a filing room, a nurse brings him another load of files.

NURSE
Here you go officer.

SAM
Thank you.

NURSE
You're welcome.

He continues copying birth certificate information into his notebook.

.............................

A pretty receptionist hands a file to a hospital worker, then looks down at her clipboard. She looks up again as DEAN walks in and pauses, looking around. She smiles as he turns to her desk. He notes her gorgeousness and raises his eyebrows.

WOMAN
Hi. Is there anything I can do for you?

DEAN
(smiling) Oh God yes.

She smiles and looks down.

DEAN
(Holding up his ID) Only I'm uh....working right now, so...

....................

SAM comes out of Salvation Medical Centre, flipping through his notebook, then clutches his head as a vision hits him. The Yellow Eyed Demon is in a babies nursery. He flashes to a mother looking out the window, he hears a train, and then see's the demon again. As soon as the vision finishes and he can focus again he quickly pulls out a map.

..........................

Later SAM is in a park, checking his map again. As he does he gets the vision flashes again. When it's over he realizes the house from the vision is in front of him. The woman from his vision pushes a pram along the road while holding an umbrella. He approaches.

SAM
Hi. Here, let me hold that for you. You look like you don't need that anymore.

WOMAN
Oh. Thanks.

She closes her umbrella while SAM holds her pram. He looks inside.

SAM
She's gorgeous. Is she yours?

WOMAN
Yeah.

SAM
(to the baby) Oh wow, hi! (to the mom) Oh sorry, I'm rude. I'm Sam. I just moved in up the block.

WOMAN
Hi. I'm Monica. This is Rosie.

SAM
Rosie? Hi Rosie.

MONICA
So, welcome to the neighbourhood.

SAM
Thanks. She's such a good baby!

MONICA
I know, I mean she...she never cries. She just stares at everybody. Sometimes she looks at you and I swear it's...it's like she's reading your mind.

SAM
What about you Monica? Have you lived here long?

MONICA
My husband and I, we bought our place just before Rosie was born.

SAM
And how old's Rosie?

MONICA
She's six months today. She's big right? Growing like a weed.

SAM
(Distracted) Yeah. Monica...

MONICA
Yeah?

SAM
Just ahhh,just take care of yourself okay?

MONICA
Yeah, you too Sam. We'll see you around.

As MONICA turns to her house a station wagon pulls into the drive, honking.

MONICA
There's Daddy!

SAM's vision returns again. The clock in the bedroom stops, the nursery rhyme playing stops, a wind sweeps through. A black figure approaches the bed. MONICA pushes the door open from the hallway and see's the figure standing over her daughters bed.

MONICA
What are you...

The figure turns to her. She is pulled back to the wall and slides up it to the ceiling. Blood starts dripping from her stomach.

MONICA
Rosie!!

The room bursts into flame.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

SAM sits at the table, rubbing his temples. DEAN and JOHN sit on the end of each bed.

JOHN
(Flatly) A vision.

SAM
(Slowly, painfully) Yes. I saw the demon burning a woman on the ceiling.

JOHN
And you think this is going to happen to this woman you met because...

SAM
Because these things happen exactly the way I see them

DEAN
It started out as nightmares. Then it started happening while he was awake.

DEAN rises and crosses to the counter behind SAM to get more coffee.

SAM
(Wincing) Yeah. It's like the closer I get to anything to do with the demon the stronger the visions get.

JOHN
All right. When were you going to tell me about this?

SAM and DEAN stop and turn to look at JOHN

DEAN
We didn't know what it meant.

JOHN
All right, something like this starts happening to your brother, you pick up the phone and you call me.

DEAN dumps the coffee jug and cup back on the counter and strides toward JOHN.

DEAN
Call you? Are you kidding me? Dad I called you from Lawrence all right? Sam called you when I was dying. I mean, getting you on the phone? I got a better chance of winning the lottery.

JOHN
You're right. Although I'm not too crazy about this new tone of yours, you're right. I'm sorry.

SAM
Look guys, visions or no visions, fact is, we know the demon is coming tonight. And this family's gonna go through the same hell we went through.

JOHN
No they're not. No one is, ever again.

SAM'S phone rings.

SAM
Hello?

MEG
Sam?

SAM
Who is this?

MEG
Think real hard it will come to you.

SAM
Meg.

DEAN and JOHN start and turn to SAM.

SAM
Last time I saw you you fell out of a window.

MEG
Yeah, no thanks to you. That really hurt my feelings by the way.

SAM
Just your feelings? That was a seven-story drop.

MEG
Lemme speak to your Dad.

SAM
(looking at JOHN) My Dad. I don't know where my Dad is.

MEG
It's time for the grown ups to talk Sam, let me speak to him now.

SAM hestitates then hands the phone to JOHN.

JOHN
This is John.

MEG
Howdy John. I'm Meg. I'm a friend of your boys. I'm also the one who watched Jim Murphy choke on his own blood....still there John-boy?

JOHN
I'm here.

MEG
Well that was yesterday. Today I'm in Lincoln. Visiting another old friend of yours. He wants to say hi....

The camera pans back on MEG to reveal a man tied to a chair. MEG holds the phone to his ear.

MAN
John, whatever you do don't give....

MEG pulls the phone away, putting her finger on her lips in a shhh-ing noise and smiling.

JOHN
Caleb?

SAM and DEAN react to the name instantly, going on alert.

JOHN
You listen to me. He's got nothing to do with anything. You let him go.

MEG
We know you have the colt John.

JOHN
I don't know what you're talking about.

MEG
Oh, okay. Well listen to this.

MEG slits Caleb's throat and holds the phone out. JOHN can hear him gasping and drowning in his own blood.

JOHN
Caleb. Caleb!

MEG
You hear that? That's the sound of your friend dying. Now let's try this again. We know you have the gun John, word travels fast. So as far as we're concerned you just declared war. And this is what war looks like. It has casualties.

JOHN
I'm gonna kill you, you know that?

MEG
Oh John please, mind your blood pressure. So this is the thing. We're going to keep doing what we're doing. And your friends, anyone who has ever helped you, gave you shelter, anyone you ever loved. They'll all die unless you give us that gun.

JOHN is quiet, thinking. The boys are close by his side.

MEG
I'm waiting Johnny, better answer before the buzzer.

JOHN
Okay.

MEG
Sorry? I didn't quite get that.

JOHN
I said okay, I'll bring you the colt.

MEG
There's a warehouse in Lincoln, on the corner of Wabash and Lake. You're gonna meet me there.

JOHN
It's gonna take me about a days drive to get there.

MEG
Meet me there at midnight tonight.

JOHN
That's impossible. I can't get there in time and I can't just carry a gun on the plane.

MEG
Oh. Well I guess your friends die don't they. If you do decide to make it, come alone.

MEG
(Hanging up and turning to Caleb's body) What the hell are you looking at.

............................

SAM
So you think Meg is a demon?

JOHN
Either that, or she's possessed by one. It doesn't really matter.

DEAN
What do we do?

JOHN
I'm going to Lincoln.

DEAN
What?

JOHN
It doesn't look lilke we have a choice. If I don't go, a lot of people die, our friends die.

SAM
Dad, the demon is coming tonight. For Monica and her family. That gun is all we got, you can't just hand it over.

JOHN
Who said anything about handing it over. Look, besides us and a coupla of vampires no ones really seen the gun, no one knows what it looks like.

DEAN
So what, you're just going to pick up a ringer at a pawn shop?

JOHN
Antique store.

DEAN
You're going to hand Meg a fake gun and hope she doesn't notice?

JOHN
Look, as long as it's close, she shouldn't be able to tell the difference.

DEAN
Yeah but for how long? What happens when she figures it out?

JOHN
I just...I just need to buy a few hours, that's all.

SAM
You mean for Dean and me. You want us to stay here, and kill this demon by ourselves?

JOHN
No Sam. I want to stop losing people we love. I want you to go to school, I want Dean to have a home. I want....I want Mary alive. It's just....I just want this to be over.

......................

EXTERIOR. MUDDY BACK ROAD.

SAM and JOHN stand at the back of his truck, checking weapons. The Impala comes toward them and DEAN gets out.

JOHN
You get it?

DEAN pulls a brown paper bag out of his pocket and hands it to JOHN. JOHN pulls out an antique gun.

DEAN
You know this is a trap don't you. That's why Meg wants you to come alone?

JOHN
I can handle her. I got a whole arsenal loaded. Holy water, Mandaic, amulets...

DEAN
Dad...

JOHN
What?

DEAN
Promise me something.

JOHN
What's that.

DEAN
This thing goes south just...get the hell out. Don't get yourself killed all right, you're no good to us dead.

JOHN
Same goes for you. (There is a long pause) All right listen to me. They made the bullets special for this colt. There's only four of them left. Without them this gun is useless. You make every shot count.

SAM
Yes sir.

JOHN
Been waiting a long time for this fight. Now it's here I'm not gonna be in it. It's up to you boys now. It's your fight, you finish this. You finish what I started. Understand?

JOHN hands DEAN the colt.

SAM
We'll see you soon Dad.

JOHN
I'll see you later.

JOHN gets in the truck and leaves. The boys stand watching him pull away.

DEAN
Later.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXTERIOR. WAREHOUSE.

JOHN pulls up in his truck, gets out and checks the antique gun, then takes out rosary beads and a flask of holy water. He starts looking around and sees a tank on the roof. Cut to JOHN jogging along an alley, stopping to check the pipes that run along it's walls and then continuing.

.........................

EXTERIOR. MONICA'S HOUSE.

SAM and DEAN sit in the Impala, the Colt between them. They watch through the window as Monica and her husband finish dinner.

SAM
Maybe we could tell em it was a gas leak. Might get em out of the house for a few hours.

DEAN
Yeah and how many times has that actually worked for us?

SAM
Yeah. (He thinks some more) We could always tell em the truth.

DEAN just looks at SAM for a long moment, one eyebrow raised.

TOGETHER
Nah!

SAM
I know I know. I just...with what's coming for these folks...

DEAN
Sam we only got one move and you know it, all right? We gotta wait for that demon to show itself and then we get it before it gets them.

They both look back at the house for a while.

SAM
I wonder how Dad's doing.

DEAN
I'd feel a lot better if we were there backing him up.

SAM
I'd feel a lot better if he were here backing us up.

They keep watching the house.

......................

EXTERIOR. WAREHOUSE.

JOHN is standing on the roof next to the tank. MEG appears in the foreground. She slowly looks around then up at the water tank. JOHN is not there. She moves inside. Cut to close up of JOHN behind the tank. He checks the coast is clear, then climbs the ladder. He opens the lid, holds the rosary up, speaks in Latin and drops the rosary into the water.

.......................

EXTERIOR. MONICA'S HOUSE

SAM
This is weird.

DEAN
What?

SAM
After all of these years we're finally here. It doesn't seem real.

DEAN
We just gotta keep our heads and do our job, like always.

SAM
Yeah but this isn't like always.

DEAN
True.

SAM
Dean...ah...I wanna thank you.

DEAN
For what?

SAM
For everything. You've always had my back you know? Even when I couldn't count on anyone I could always count on you. And ah...I don't know I just wanted to let you know, Just in case

DEAN
Whoa whoa whoa, are you kidding me?

SAM
What?

DEAN
Don't say just in case something happens to you. I don't wanna hear that freaking speech man. Nobody's dying tonight. Not us, not that family, nobody. Except that demon. That evil son of a bitch ain't getting any older than tonight, you understand me?

.........................

INTERIOR. WAREHOUSE.

MEG stands in the middle of the room. She hears a creak a turns. JOHN is walking towards her. He stops a few feet away.

MEG
John, you made it. Too bad really, I was hoping to kill more of your friends.

JOHN
Sorry to disappoint.

MEG
I can see where you boys get their good looks. Though I must admit, considering what they say about you I thought you'd be....taller.

JOHN just stares at her.

MEG
Well aren't you the chatty one. You wanna get to business? Fine. Why don't you just hand over the gun.

JOHN
If I give you the gun how do I get out of here?

MEG
If you're as good as they say you are I'm sure you'll figure something out.

JOHN
Maybe I'll just shoot you.

MEG
You wanna shoot me baby? Go ahead. There's more where I came from.

Another demon, a guy, walks out of the shadows.

JOHN
Who the hells that?

MEG
He's not nearly as much fun as I am I can tell you that. So I suggest you give us the gun.

JOHN stares at the other demon for a long moment, then back at Meg.

MEG
Now!

JOHN hands over the gun to MEG, butt first. She checks it out.

MEG
This is the colt?

JOHN nods.

MEG
(Handing the gun to the other demon) What do you think?

The other demon looks at it, points it at the ceiling, cocks it....and shoots MEG in the chest.

MEG (stagging back, grabbing at the wound) You shot me! I can't believe you just shot me!!

DEMON
(Looking at JOHN) It's a fake.

He throws the gun away. MEG also turns to look at JOHN.


END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INTERIOR. WAREHOUSE.

MEG
You're dead John. Your boys are dead.

JOHN
(Backing slowly away) I've never used the gun. How could I know it wouldn't work?

MEG
(Advancing) I'm so not in the mood for this. I've just been shot

JOHN
Well then I guess you're lucky the gun wasn't real.

MEG
That's funny John. We're going to strip the skin from your bones, but that was funny.

A noise of gas escaping distracts MEG for a split second and JOHN runs into the other room, locking the door and going down a hatch into the alley he was in earlier, lined with pipes. MEG and the other demon kick open the door and follow. JOHN reaches the other end and turns on a tap. Water starts gushing over the floor. The other demon, now in front of MEG, pauses, then continues. As he walks through the water his feet begin steaming and he jumps backwards, yelling.

MEG
Holy water John. Real cute.

JOHN takes off.

.........................

EXTERIOR. MONICA'S HOUSE.

DEAN
(Holding his phone to his ear) Dad's not answering.

SAM
Maybe Meg was late. Maybe cell reception's bad.

DEAN
Yeah well.

The radio starts chattering with static.

SAM
Dean wait. Listen.

SAM rolls the dial on the radio, hearing more static come and go. The wind picks up and the lights in the house flicker. DEAN turns to look at SAM.

SAM
It's coming.

They jump out of the car.

.................................

EXTERIOR. WAREHOUSE.

JOHN makes it back to his truck to find all the tires slashed.

Damn it.

He runs around the side of the building.

.............................

DEAN uses a card to slide the lock on the front door open and they enter silently. As they approach the lounge, SAM first, DEAN is confronted by MONICA'S husband. He swings a bat at DEAN'S head and misses, smashing a lamp.

HOLDEN
Get out of my house!

DEAN quickly closes in and grapples with him, grabbing the bat.

HOLDEN
Get out of my house!

SAM
Please please. Mr Holden please.

DEAN easily takes control, swinging him against the wall and holding the bat across his throat.

DEAN
(Sharply) Be quiet and listen to me. Be quiet and listen. We are trying to help you.

MONICA
(From upstairs) Charlie? Is everything okay?

HOLDEN
(Yelling) Monica get the baby!

SAM
(At the same time) Don't go in the nursery!

HOLDEN
You stay away from her!

He struggles to get away from DEAN. DEAN backhands him, knocking him unconscious, and puts him over his shoulder in a fireman's lift.

..............................

UPSTAIRS

MONICA, in her nightgown as she was in SAM'S vision, pushes the door to the nursery open. A dark figure stands over Rosie's crib.

MONICA
What are you...

The figure raises his hand and MONICA is flung back against the wall. SAM races up the stairs and along the corridor as MONICA slides up the wall and onto the ceiling. He enters the room and the dark figure turns to him , yellow eyes shining. SAM hesitates, frozen and staring.

MONICA
Rosie!

SAM raises the Colt and pulls the trigger. The demon disappears into smoke. MONICA, screaming, falls to the floor.

SAM
Where the hell did it go!

MONICA
My baby!

MONICA stands, trying to move toward the crib, and is caught by SAM.

MONICA
My baby!!

SAM
No wait!

MONICA
(Fighting SAM) MY BABY!!!

DEAN
(running past them to the crib) Take her and go!

MONICA
Rosie!

SAM
Come on.

MONICA
My baby!

SAM
(Forcing her out of the room) Dean's got her.

DEAN quickly wraps the blankets around the baby and pulls her up as the crib explodes into flame. He races out of the room.

............................

EXTERIOR. WAREHOUSE.

JOHN runs down a dead end and stops, looking around and gasping for breath. He grabs for his phone but as he raises it he is flung against the wall, losing his grip on the phone. He hits the wall, groaning in pain. The male demon appears as JOHN begins to slide up the wall and stands in front of him, smiling.

........................

EXTERIOR. MONICA'S HOUSE.

The nursery window explodes outwards, flames shooting out. The camera pans down to a smoke filled front doorway and MONICA appears, guided by SAM. Both are coughing. HOLDEN staggers up from where he was lying on the grass.

HOLDEN
You get away from my family.

MONICA
No Charlie don't. They saved us.

DEAN runs out to join them, holding the baby.

MONICA
(Beginning to cry) I mean they saved us.

MONICA takes the baby from DEAN and her husband puts his arms around both of them.

MONICA
(to SAM and DEAN) Thank you.

Devastated, SAM and DEAN turn back to the burning house. The demon is silhouetted in the burning nursery, standing completely still.

SAM
(Starting back inside) It's still in there!

DEAN
(Grabbing SAM) Sam. Sam, no.

SAM
(Struggling) Dean let me go, it's still in there.

DEAN
No. It's burning to the ground, it's suicide.

SAM
(Yelling) I don't care.

DEAN
I do!

They both look back up as the flames rise again and the demon disappears.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM.

DEAN paces while holding the phone to his ear, listening to it ring out. SAM sits on the bed.

DEAN
(Frustrated) Come on Dad, answer your phone damn it.

DEAN
(Hanging up) Somethings wrong.

SAM stares at the wall, giving great bitchface.

DEAN
You hear me? Somethings wrong.

SAM
If you had just let me go in there, I coulda ended all this.

DEAN
Sam, the only thing you would have ended was your life.

SAM
You don't know that.

DEAN
(walking toward the bed) So what, you're just willing to sacrifice yourself, is that it?

SAM
(Standing up) Yeah. Yeah you're damn right I am.

DEAN
Well that's not going to happen, not as long as I'm around.

SAM
What the hell are you talking about Dean, we've been searching for this demon our whole lives. It's the only thing we've ever cared about.

DEAN
Sam I wanna waste it. I do. Okay? But it's not worth dying over.

SAM
What?

DEAN
I mean it. If hunting this demon means getting yourself killed then I hope we never find the damn thing.

SAM
That thing killed Jess. That thing killed Mom.

DEAN
You said yourself once, that no matter what we do, they're gone, and they're never coming back.

SAM totally loses it, grabs DEAN and shoves him hard against the wall.

SAM
(Angry and upset) Don't you say that, not you! Not after all this don't you say that.

DEAN
(Quietly) Sam look. The three of us...that's all we have...and it's all I have. Sometimes I feel like I'm barely holding it together man...and without you or Dad....

SAM
(Upset) Dad.

SAM lets go and turns away, walking across the room. DEAN stays where he is, taking deep breaths.

SAM
(Tears in his eyes) He should have called by now. Try him again.

DEAN raises his phone.

.......................

INTERIOR. UNKNOWN

JOHN's phone sits on a bench, ringing. MEG wanders over and picks it up. She looks at the screen, smiles to herself and answers.

MEG
You boys really screwed up this time.

DEAN
(Angry) Where is he.

MEG
You're never going to see your father again.
