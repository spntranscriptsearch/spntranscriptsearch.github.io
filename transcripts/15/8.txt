Opening scene montage (Jumping the Shark 0419, Point of No Return 0518, Swan Song 0522)

ADAM: Is this John? 

DEAN: John died. Who is this? 

ADAM: I-I'm his son.

DEAN: Adam was our brother. He died like a hunter. He deserves to go out like one.

SAM: Maybe we can bring him back, get ahold of Cas, call in a favor.

ADAM: These angels tell me that I'm chosen. Michael, I'm his sword or vessel.

CASTIEL: Hey, ass-butt! [GLASS SHATTERS]

ADAM/MICHAEL [SCREAMS]

SAM/LUCIFER: We're brothers. God is doing this to us! 



THEN title scene (Proverbs 17:3 1505, Golden Time 1506)

DEAN: God was supposed to be gone.

SAM: What if I'm seeing Chuck's endings? - Aah! - Eileen, we can bring you back.

SAM: Ex spiritu incarnatum est. Chuck is weak. I think we can beat him.



CHUCK: I can see it now "Supernatural: The End".



DEAN: It's God, Sam. How the hell are we supposed to fight God? 



NOW title scene

[HENRY FORD'S "TAKE ME FOR WHAT I AM" PLAYS]

SCENE INTERIOR LUCKY ELEPHANT CASINO

[SLOT MACHINE CHIMING]

 [A cocktail server nervously puts the finishing touches on a drink. As she is serving the cocktail, we see casino patrons, dealers, and servers scattered dead around the casino]

[SLOT MACHINE BLARING, COINS CLACKING]

[The server steps over the dead bodies and offers the cocktail to Chuck]

CHUCK: You went easy on the rum this time, right?

SERVER: Aha.

CHUCK: OK, cool. 'Cause, you know, you don't want me cranky.

[throws the garnish at a slot machine] Keep 'em coming.

[SLOT MACHINE BLARING, COINS CLACKING]

CHUCK: That's a winner!



SUPERNATURAL title scene

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

[GRUNTING]

[Eileen is fighting a monster in a dark factory] 

EILEEN: Aah! [GRUNTING.]

[ROARS]

[Eileen pulls her blade and moves to attack but finds it's Sam] 



EILEEN: Sam?! 

[She pushes Sam aside and kills the monster]

[BODY THUDS]



EILEEN: Hey! Were you tailing me? 

SAM: You could have left a note.

EILEEN: You're worried about me.

SAM: You- You think I'm being overprotective? 

EILEEN: A little bit.



SCENE MOL MAP ROOM

[Eileen is eating a burger and fries while Sam eats a salad]

[SAM SNIFF]

 [Dean enters carrying something]

DEAN: I got it! The answer to all of our problems maybe. So, we know that Chuck is weak, right? If we're to take our shot, now's the time. But a weak God is still God. So, how the hell are we supposed to take him down? Well, I was doing some thinking. What if the answer is right under our noses? 

SAM: The demon tablet? 

DEAN: Boom. 

[Eileen looking confused]

SAM: This was dictated by God Himself. Instructions on how to seal angels and demons back into heaven and hell if- if they ever tried to take over Earth.

DEAN: Exactly. But if Chuck was so freaking invincible, then why wasn't he able to protect us from the dick demons or even the dickier angels? 'Cause, remember, these babies were dictated before he took a powder.

EILEEN: So, he was worried about humans, if he couldn't protect them? 

SAM: Yeah. Like, if, for some reason, he were out of commission.

DEAN: Which is weird, considering that he's supposed to be untouchable, unless he is not untouchable.

[SAM EXHALES SHARPLY]

SAM: So, he has an Achilles heel.

DEAN: Well, I'm saying he has a weak spot.

SAM: Yeah, that's- that's 

DEAN: These hunks of rock, they're- they're like a they're like an advanced directive, okay? In case something happens to Chuck because there is a crack in his invincibility shield.

EILEEN: So, you guys can read that? 

DEAN: No. But I've got that handled.



SCENE EXTERIOR DONATELLO'S HOUSE

[Castiel pounds on front door]

CASTIEL: I know you're in there.

[Castiel walks over to window]

[Raps gently on window startling Donatello]

CASTIEL: Donatello, would you please? 

DONATELLO: [WHISPERING] Go away! 



SCENE MOL LIBRARY

[Donatello sitting in corner]

[GROANS][SIGHS]

DONATELLO: I'm not sure I'm ready for this. What you're trying to do, it- it doesn't sound possible.

DEAN: Look, we know that Chuck overpowered his sister, the Darkness, and locked her up, so.

CASTIEL: We may be able to lock him up, too.

DONATELLO: Why don't you just kill him? 

SAM: God has to exist to maintain the balance of the universe. Without him, creation would fall apart.

DEAN: Right, so, the best thing to do is toss him in solitary and throw away the key.

DONATELLO: Okay, but the last time, it took the power God to do this? I mean, even if he has a hidden flaw, do you have the power of God? 

SAM: You know what? Uh, one step at a time. You figure out how to lock him up, we'll take care of the rest.

DONATELLO: [SIGHS] Oh. And, guys, when I go crazy again, just shoot me.



[Donatello is working in the library next to a plate of chicken bones. Sam, Dean, and Castiel are trying to look busy while watching him work]

DONATELLO: Stop it.

[Sits back reading his notes]

DONATELLO: Oh. This is interesting.



DEAN: What? 

SAM: What is it? 

DONATELLO: There appear to be annotations, uh, personal observations.

CASTIEL: By Metatron? 

DONATELLO: By the scribe, yes. Uh, as if he were trying to give some context to God's actions.

DEAN: For example? 

DONATELLO: "The Almighty guards his secret fear, but it is always there".

SAM: Fear of what?

DONATELLO: "Fear of what, I do not know. This he shares only with his favorite".

DEAN: Favorite? 

CASTIEL: Wait, his favorite at the time at the time this was written, Lucifer had been cast down. Michael sealed him in the Cage. So Michael was the favorite.

DEAN: Oh, yeah, a real daddy's boy.

SAM: But if Michael helped Chuck overpower Amara, then maybe he also knows how to lock him up.

CASTIEL: Perhaps, but even if we could get to him, he wouldn't tell us.

DEAN: I don't know. But I mean, if my dad kept me locked up in a cage for 10 years, I might be looking to get some payback. It's worth a shot.

DONATELLO: Swell! So, you guys talk to Michael. Problem solved, right?! 

DEAN: Not exactly. Michael's in hell.

CASTIEL: Yeah, he was possessing Adam, Sam and Dean's half-brother, when he fell into hell with Sam, who was possessed by Lucifer, and then they were all sealed in the Cage.

DONATELLO: What is it with you people?! Can anything you do be easy?! I mean… 



[Donatello stiffens, eyes roll back and he drops into his chair]



But where's the fun in that? [CHUCKLES] This story just gets better and better.

DEAN: Donny, you going crazy again? 

DONATELLO/CHUCK: Oh, Donatello's not here any longer. Hey, guys.

CASTIEL: It's Chuck. 

DONATELLO/CHUCK: Prophets speak the word of God, sometimes indirectly. Sometimes they're my bluetooth. So, here's the thing. Usually, I really love our little process. I toss something at you guys, and you slam it right back.

It's fun, like tennis. With monsters. But this, let this one go.

DEAN: Or what? 

DONATELLO/CHUCK: Or I go all-powerful. Maybe not on you. Not right away. But, let's see, there's Jody, Donna, Eileen. Pretty much everybody on your speed dial. So drop it. 'Kay? 

SCENE TO BLACK





SCENE MOL LIBRARY

CASTIEL: Well, the bunker's warding is intact, but it clearly doesn't withstand God. How much do you think he heard? 

SAM: He heard enough.

CASTIEL: So do we drop it? 

DEAN: Donnie, I think it might be safer if you went on home.

DONATELLO: Really? I have to leave? Oh, that's too bad. I'll, uh I'll just get my stuff.

[Donatello runs out of the library grabbing his jacket and a bucket of chicken]

DEAN: Okay. Like hell we're dropping this.

CASTIEL: Donna, Jody, they're not safe.

SAM: They'll never be safe. As long as Chuck is out there, it's only a matter of time… 

DEAN: Before he rounds them up and offs 'em. Just to watch us suffer.

SAM: The only way to keep them safe to keep everyone safe is to take Chuck down.

DEAN: Which is exactly what we're gonna do.

CASTIEL: Are we seriously talking about going to hell to try to speak to Michael? Michael, who is in the Cage, and insane? 

SAM: Yeah, and who told us that? 

DEAN: Lucifer. And Chuck. Now, I trust them as far as I can throw them. But, Cas, if you wanna stay here, why don't you stay here? 



SCENE MOL KITCHEN

[Sam is preparing a spell while Eileen and Castiel watch]

[Dean slices his palm to add blood to the spell]

CASTEIL: Here. Allow me.  [Heals Dean's hand]

DEAN: Thanks.

CASTIEL: Well, I think we're done. It's exactly the spell Rowena used. Just without Rowena.

DEAN: Alright, let's do 'er.

SAM: "Initium ad inferna permittatur".

[All three touch the bowl as Castiel throws a lit match into the bowl]

[Strong wind starts blowing. The three vanish in a bright light]



[A bright light flashes as the three reappear in hell]

SAM: Now where? 

CASTIEL: This way.

[They enter a large antechamber with large statues]

[Female demons appear]

CASTIEL: Sam. Dean.

DEAN: Ladies. Look, we're not looking for trouble, okay? We just wanna talk…

DEAMON: Aah! 

[FIGHTING BEGINS]

DEAN: Are any of us winning?! 

[FIGHTING CONTINUES]

WOMAN: Stop! 

[FIGHTING STOPS AND DEMONS RELEASE THE MEN]

 [Recovering from their fights, they turn to face the woman]

ROWENA: Hello, boys.

SCENE TO BLACK







ROWENA: You did say you wanted to see the one in charge? 

DEAN: Rowena, we thought you were dead.

ROWENA: Oh, I am, dear. Pretty much everyone here is. When I closed the fissure, it did cost me my life, and my soul went to hell. Big surprise.

CASTIEL: And the demons just handed you the throne? 

ROWENA: No one hands you anything, darlin'. I took it. So, why are you here?

DEAN: Chuck. He's back, and he's outta control, and we need to rein him in.

ROWENA: You want to rein in God.

SAM: We think there's a way. Listen, we just need to speak to Michael.

ROWENA: Michael, the out-of-his-head archangel? [CHUCKLES] This just gets better. Ahh. Well, anyway, it doesn't matter.

SAM: What? 

ROWENA: He won't be in the Cage. Every door here was flung wide when Chuck opened the fissure. Your archangel could be anywhere in hell, or out of hell, for that matter.

DEAN: Rowena, we're running outta time, okay? We need Michael yesterday.

ROWENA: Did you not hear the man? [SCREAMING] Find him! 



SCENE MOL KITCHEN

[Eileen answers video phone call on computer]

WOMAN: Eileen? [LAUGHING] Oh, my God! I didn't know if you'd pick up. People are saying you're…

EILEEN: Dead?

WOMAN: Yeah.

EILEEN: Didn't take.

WOMAN: Clearly. Uh, anyway, do you remember I'm Sue Barrish. We worked that ghoul case.

EILEEN: Yeah, I remember.

WOMAN/SUE: I'm, uh, following this vamp's nest. They're migrating, looking for decent feeding grounds, and, well, when they get stopped, I'm gonna need help cleaning them out.

EILEEN: Where are they now? 

SUE: Moving down I-80, towards Omaha.

EILEEN: I'm close to there.

SUE: So- you're in? 

EILEEN: I'm kinda in the middle of something. But if I'm free.

SUE: Cool! Uh, I'll call you.

[Eileen adds more ingredients to bowl to increase the purple flames]



SCENE ROWENA'S THRONE ROOM IN HELL

[ROWENA SIPS]

SAM: Rowena, I 

ROWENA: Samuel, please. You killing me was one of the best things that ever happened. Yes, there are things I miss about being alive. Flesh-on-flesh sex.
 Amazon doesn't deliver here, yet. But, lads, I'm queen. My subjects revere me. Well, fear me, which is better. I should have died a long time ago. Samuel, be a dear.

[raises glass to indicate she would like more]

SAM: Yeah. [Sam leaves the room.]

ROWENA: What am I picking up from you two? A wee tiff? Tell your Auntie Rowena.

DEAN: It's fine. Don't worry about it.

CASTIEL: It's fine.

ROWENA: Boys? Fix it. I don't have many regrets, but the few I do still haunt me. Making Napoleon so short was just bitchy. Telling Mick Jagger he had no future when I dumped him. And, well, everything with dear Fergus. Then one day, you die, you go to hell, they make you queen, and you can't make it right. So fix it! [SAM RETURNS]

Thank you, my dove.

[DOOR OPENS AND DEMON ENTERS]

DEMON: Milady.

ROWENA: Aye? 

DEMON: Michael, he's nowhere to be found.

SAM: Then where is he? 



SCENE JACI's RED WAGON DINER

[MID-TEMPO COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS]

[A waitress delivers a burger and fries to a table. Adam takes a bite of the burger]

ADAM: Mmm.

MICHAEL: You know that stuff will kill you, right? 

ADAM: Worth it. Michael, I haven't seen a burger in 10 years.

MICHAEL: [SCOFFS] Go for it, kid.

ADAM: You know, I know I don't need to eat. It just tastes so damn good.

MICHAEL: I wouldn't know. I don't know much about any of this. You'll be my guide.

[waitress delivers a pepperoni pizza]

ADAM: Thank you.

WAITRESS: You got it.

ADAM: So, what about you? You gonna go back to heaven? 

MICHAEL: Uh, I don't know. My brothers are dead. My father never returned. In so many ways, I'm alone.

ADAM: Yeah. Same here. It's not like I have family waiting to see me.

MICHAEL: You have the Winchesters, your brothers.

ADAM: I met them once. And they let me rot in hell.

MICHAEL: Family.

ADAM: Family sucks.



SCENE MOL LIBRARY

[Dean on phone to Donatello at his home]

DEAN: Donnie, hey. How you doing, pal? Listen, uh, we got ourselves a little situation here.

DONATELLO: I thought I was off the case.

DEAN: Off the case? No, come on, pal. You're part of the team.

DONATELLO: Oh. Gratifying.

DEAN: Listen, have you, uh, sensed anything lately? 

DONATELLO: Uh, like? 

DEAN: Like a-a surge of power? But not- not God-like. But almost God-like.

DONATELLO: Uh, no, I don't think so.

DEAN: Okay, well, we've kind of got ourselves an emergency here, so, uh, if anything tickles your brain, you let us know.

DONATELLO: Tickles my…? 

DEAN: Gotta go.

[Hangs up phone and joins Sam in map room]

DEAN: Well, Donnie's got zip. What about you? 

SAM: [CLEARS THROAT] Nothing that screams "archangel".

DEAN: Yeah. Eileen did good, right? Getting us back from hell. She doing okay? SAM: Yeah. I guess.

DEAN: You guess? 

SAM: If she needs something from me, she'll tell me. We have an agreement.

DEAN: You have an agreement? That's adorable.

SAM: [CLEARS THROAT]

DEAN: Look, man, I didn't want to say anything, okay, 'cause I was kind of in in a bad place, and, uh, yeah, I didn't want to jinx it or whatever, but, you know, I tried the family thing, right? 

SAM: Yeah, me too. And that's not for us.

DEAN: No, not really. But I'm just saying if it was to work, Eileen, you know, she gets it. She gets us. She gets the life. She's hot.

SAM: [SCOFFS] Dean. I mean, I'm not even-

DEAN: Look, all I'm saying is you- you could do worse, okay? And she could certainly do better. Like, so much better. I'm happy for you, Sammy.



SCENE INTERIOR JACI'S RED WAGON DINER

ADAM: Maybe I should pick up some kinda little job.

MICHAEL: A little job? 

ADAM: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, these are the same clothes we went to hell in. We're gonna have expenses, right? And whatever change I had, I spent on food, so, it's not like I can go back to college. [CHUCKLING.] Not with an archangel inside of me.

YOUNG WOMAN: Hello, Michael.

MICHAEL: Lilith. You're dead.

Lilith: Was. Now I'm back, baby. And I've been sent to fetch you.

MICHAEL: I'm not accustomed to being fetched. Who sent you? 

LILITH: You have to ask? Your daddy. God. Yeah. He'd like a word.

MICHAEL: You're lying.

LILITH: Really not.

MICHAEL: Then why would he send you, a demon, a speck of infernal bile? 

LILITH: One, ouch. Two, maybe because we worked together before. Remember? Setting off the Apocalypse? 

MICHAEL: To try and bring God back.

LILITH: Right. Didn't work then, but then he came back on his own. So, win? 

MICHAEL: If that's true, he can come talk to me himself.

LILITH: Yeah, except I'm not supposed to leave without you.

MICHAEL: Get out.

LILITH: Michael. I can't fail him.

[MICHAEL'S EYES FLASH BLUE AND HE SMITES LILITH IN A BRIGHT FLASH OF LIGHT]

[A dish shatters in a sink, we're at Donatello's home who is sensing Michael's power]

DONATELLO: Whoa! 

[People in diner are stopped and staring at Michael]

MICHAEL: Remember nothing.

[SNAPS]

[Diner returns to as if nothing happened]

[CELLPHONE VIBRATES, BEEPS]

DEAN: Yo, Donnie? 

DONATELLO: I know where he is.

DEAN: Really? 

DONATELLO: I think he's in- Whoa! There! No, there- No, there! There! 

DEAN: Damn it, Donnie! 

DONATELLO: He's hurtling all over, Dean. There! Alright. He stopped. He seems to be staying put. 

DEAN: Okay, where? 

DONATELLO: Cairo. Egypt. Excuse me. I need Bourbon.

[PHONE BEEPS]

DEAN: Alright, well, good news is we know where he is. Bad news is we can't get to him in time. Not before he moves again.

CASTIEL: Then we bring him to us. [PRAYING] Michael. Michael. This is Castiel. We didn't know each other very well, and our last meeting was unpleasant. But I know you have been through a terrible ordeal for many years. You've been beyond the reach of heaven. Been beyond the reach of Earth. Much has changed with both. Heaven is not what it was. And your father, your father is certainly not who you knew. Michael, there's a battle raging, and you are a warrior, but you must know the nature of this fight. I'm not your enemy anymore. Now we all have the same enemy. God Himself.



SCENE INTERIOR WAREHOUSE

CASTIEL: Michael? [WHOOSHING] Thank you. Thank you for coming. Do you remember me? 

MICHAEL: You called me "ass-butt" and set me on fire. And then you helped send me to hell.

CASTIEL: I did.

MICHAEL: And now what? You’ve come to tell me that God, my father, creator of all things, is my enemy? Or maybe you just came to beg forgiveness.

CASTIEL: Oh, I didn't come to beg.

[LIGHTER FLICKS]

[Michael is encircled with flames from holy oil]

[SAM AND DEAN ENTER]

[Dean shows Michael a pair of handcuffs]

MICHAEL: Castiel, what have you done? 



SCENE TO BLACK



SCENE NONDESCTIPT MOL ROOM

MICHAEL: Even for you especially for you, this is stupid.

DEAN: Good to see you too, Mike.

MICHAEL: Sam. You look well. Last time I saw you in the Cage… 

SAM: Yeah, it doesn't matter. We need your help. God…

MICHAEL: I've heard. Repeatedly.

CASTIEL: Well, then you're aware that…

MICHAEL: I'm not aware of anything. You're asking me to trust you- you, who doomed me, you, who let Lucifer walk free while your own brother sat in hell.

SAM: Doing what we do, we've had to get used to losing people. Probably too used to it. With Adam, we said goodbye because we thought we had to. We were wrong.

MICHAEL: Well, don't tell me. Tell him.

[Eyes flash with blue light]

ADAM: Hey, Sam. Dean.

SAM: Adam? 

ADAM: Ha! [CHUCKLES]

DEAN: Wait, Mic- Michael lets you talk? I mean, he lets you be? 

ADAM: Uh, yeah. In the Cage, we came to an agreement. We only had each other.

DEAN: Adam, look, I know we bailed on you, okay, and there is nothing that we can say to fix that.

ADAM: [SIGHS] How about, uh "I'm sorry"? [Eyes flash with blue light]

MICHAEL: Enough. Why am I here? 

CASTIEL: Michael, we needed to speak with you because God is back. You didn't think the Cage just opened on its own, did you? 

MICHAEL: If my father is back, he will usher in Paradise.

DEAN: No, he won't. Because Paradise is boring, and your dad he's just looking to be entertained. Which means we're his puppets. All of us, especially you.

MICHAEL: I won't hear this. You're lying. I don't know what your agenda is, but you're lying.

CASTIEL: Michael.

ADAM: [Eyes flash blue] Hey.

It's Adam. [CHUCKLES.] I'd give it a rest. He's not listening.



[Adam and Michael are alone in the MOL room]

ADAM: So, I've been thinking. Maybe they're not lying.

MICHAEL: Ohh.

ADAM: H-Hear me out. Sam and Dean try to be on the right side of things. They actually do. They tried to talk me out of taking you on, for example, out of all of this.

MICHAEL: So, you forgive them? 

ADAM: Oh, hell, no. No. But that's not what this is about. It's- Look, if they tell you something's off with God, it's because they believe it's true. And if they believe it, it probably is true.

MICHAEL: You and I have been together for years. My father and I have been together for eternity. I exist because he willed it.

ADAM: So he's having a mid-eternity crisis. Or- Or, maybe you don't know your dad as well as you think you do.

MICHAEL: Oh. Mm.

ADAM: The point is parents keep secrets, right? Does it hurt to ask the question? 

MICHAEL: Yes! It would. It would mean that I doubt him. The good son, the favorite, doubts his father.

ADAM: You still care about that? After he left you in the Cage? 



SCENE EILEEN IN MOL LIBRARY

[Eileen is on video call with Sue}

SUE: The vamps have stopped moving just outside Omaha. They'll start setting up a nest. We need to move on them before they get their defenses in place. Can you help? 

Eileen: I… 

SUE: What?! Do you have to ask for permission? 

EILEEN: Send me the directions.

SUE: I just texted them to you.  [SUE GASPS] Son of a bitch! 

[PICTUR ON PHONE GOES DARK]

[Eileen hurries to Sam's room and knocks]

SAM: Ohh! Hey.

EILEEN: I was talking to a friend. She's working a vamp case. She's in trouble.

SAM: Okay. Let's go.

[Sam grabs his coat and run out following Eileen]



SCENE ADAM/MICHAEL IN MOL ROOM

[Castiel enters]

CASTIEL: Adam? 

MICHAEL: Not this time. I'll spare you the effort. I'm not gonna betray my father and everything I've believed in.

CASTIEL: Why not? You know, he betrayed you. You know, Michael, I never really liked you. Even when I was just another angel, I thought you were too haughty, too- To paraphrase a friend, you had an entire oak tree shoved up your ass.

But now? I'm looking at you, and I- I just pity you. Because you were never God's favorite. You were just a little part of his story, a tiny part of his story. You weren't even a star. At least Lucifer knew that God can't be trusted. But I guess he was always the smart one.

[Michael jumps up and grabs Cas and they start fighting]

CASTIEL: See the truth for yourself.

[Castiel reaches up and takes ahold of Michael's head as his eyes flash blue]



SCENE MONTAGE 

[Scenes from Moriah 14.20 cut with flashes of Chuck as he's writing and of Michael's face as Cas is showing him the images]

CHUCK: I'm a writer. Lying's kinda what we do.

Of all the Sams and Deans in all the multiverse, you're my favorite show.

JACK: And you were right. I am a monster.

SAM: Wait, you're enjoying this.

CHUCK: Shh.

CHUCK: This isn't how the- the story's supposed to end! 

DEAN: The story? Wait, what are you saying? 

SAM: He's saying he's been playing us. This whole time. Everything. This is all you because you wrote it all, right? Because we're your favorite show? Because we're part of your story? 

DEAN: The Apocalypse, with Lucifer and Michael, you knew everything that was going on. Why didn't you just snap your fingers and end it?! 

CHUCK: Fine! That's the way you want it?! Story's over. Welcome to the end.

SCENE MOL KITCHEN

[Castiel sitting at the table as Dean enters and grabs beer from the fridge]

DEAN: Maybe you went too far.

CASTIEL: Maybe.

DEAN: I mean, he's been in lockdown for quite a while, you know? Maybe you just, uh, went too fast. What's he doing now? 

CASTIEL: No idea. He was very distraught.

DEAN: Yeah, but what exactly did he say? 

CASTIEL: "Leave. Get out. I want you dead". We didn't bond. Where's Sam? 

DEAN: Eileen hit a snag with a case. So, he won't be gone long.

[RUMBLING]

CASTIEL: Michael.

[Dean and Castiel enter the room with Michael]

MICHAEL: God lied to me. I gave everything for him. I loved him. Why? I'm not even the only Michael.





SCENE NEARLY EMPTY PARKING GARAGE

[Eileen and Sam see a late-model pickup with the door open]

SAM: Okay.

[They exit Eileen's car]

SAM: She said she saw vampires here? It looks empty.

SUE: Look again.

EILEEN: Sue. You're okay. Thank God.

[Sue changes into Chuck in a ball of black smoke]

CHUCK: Any time. Hi, Sam.



SCENE MOL ROOM WITH MICHAEL, DEAN, and CASTIEL

MICHAEL: So, yes, I will help you. What was done to the Darkness can be done to God, if he's as weak as you say. And I know how.

[Michael pulls a folded piece of paper from his pocket and slides it across the table]

MICHAEL: That's the spell. 

CASTIEL: And the ingredients? 

MICHAEL: Myrrh, cassia, rockrose.

DEAN: We've got that.

MICHAEL: And, to bind the spell together, the nectar from a Leviathan blossom.

DEAN: A Leviathan blossom? What is that, like a flower? 

MICHAEL: A flower that only grows in one place. Purgatory.

[SNAPS FINGERS]

[Yellow portal opens behind him]

MICHAEL: That's the door. It'll remain open for 12 hours. Now, if you'll please.

[Dean removes handcuffs]

DEAN: You coming with us? 

MICHAEL: No.

DEAN: Before you go, can I talk to him? 

[Michael's eyes flash blue]

ADAM: Yeah? 

DEAN: Adam, I want you to know we are sorry. What happened to you… You're a good man. You didn't deserve that.

ADAM: Since when do we get what we deserve? Good luck.
