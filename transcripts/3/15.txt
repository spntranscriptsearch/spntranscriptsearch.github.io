TEASER
EXT. NIGHT - OUTSIDE A HOSPITAL

DOCTOR 1
Up for a drink?

DOCTOR 2
No, I can't. I got to be up at the crack of dawn. Duty calls.

DOCTOR 1
Boob job?

DOCTOR 2
I wish. Nah, some crabby old broad wants the works. I need a forklift to get it all back up.

DOCTOR 1
All that work to have what? 15 minutes off her faces?

DOCTOR 2
Staying young is a brutal business.

Doctor 2 goes to his car. He is grabbed from behind and thrown in the trunk of a car.

DOCTOR 2
(banging on the trunk) Hey! Help! Let me out of here! Help!

Doctor 2 stumbles into the hospital.

NURSE
Sir?

DOCTOR 2
Please.

NURSE
It's okay, sir. Let me see what happened. Don't you worry. There's nothing I haven't seen.

DOCTOR 2
No, no, no...

NURSE
Let me see...

The nurse pulls at what the doctor is clutching and begins to scream.

ACT ONE
INTERIOR. ABANDONED CABIN, SIDE ROOM.

Close up of a Demon strapped to a chair having holy water thrown on him. The Demon screams and thrashes from side to side.

DEAN
You ready to talk?

DEMON
I don't know. I don't know anything!

DEAN
Oh, you hear that, Sam? He doesn't know anything.

SAM
(Smirking) Yeah, I heard.

DEMON
I'm telling you the truth.

DEAN
Oh, you are? My god, then I owe you an apology. Allow me to make it up to you. (DEAN forces holy water into the Demon's mouth) I'm gonna ask you one last time...Who holds my contract?!

The Demon goes quiet, head hanging. When he looks up his eyes are black and he is smiling.

DEMON
Your mother. Yeah, she, uh, showed it to me right before I bent her over.

DEAN
(leaning close) I want a name. Or else...

DEMON
Or what? You're gonna squirt your holy water in both ends? Please. Brother, that's like a fleabite compared to what's coming to me if I tell you jack. Do what you want. The only thing I'm scared of is the demon holding your ticket.

DEAN stares at the Demon then looks at SAM, who nods and begins reciting an exorcism.

DEAN
How does that feel? Does that feel good?

DEMON
Go ahead. Send me back to hell... 'Cause when you get there, I'll be waiting for you...with a few pals who are dying for a nice little meet and greet with Dean Winchester.

SAM
Should I?

DEAN
Send him someplace he can't hurt anyone else.

Sam continues the exorcism. The Demon begins screaming.

........................

INTERIOR. MAIN ROOM OF CABIN

SAM
(Into his phone) You ran the prints twice? Are you sure? Okay. Yeah, just chalk it up to lab error. Don't I know it. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, I'll tell the lieutenant.

Dean enters.

SAM
Bury the body?

DEAN
Yeah. Looks like these demons ride 'em hard just for kicks. (He opens and chugs on a beer then crashes tiredly onto a couch.) What was the phone call about?

SAM
Remember that thing in the paper yesterday?

DEAN
"Stripper suffocates dude with thighs"?

SAM
The other thing.

DEAN
Right, the guy that walks into the E.R. and kneels over dead. His stomach's ripped out?

SAM
His liver, actually. Anyways, I just found out something pretty damn interesting.

DEAN
What?

SAM
The dead body covered in bloody fingerprints, not the victim's.

DEAN
Okay, great. My man Dave Caruso will be stoked to hear it.

SAM
Those fingerprints match a guy who died in 1981.

DEAN
Really. So, what are we talking? Uh, walking dead? Walking, killing dead?

SAM
Maybe.

DEAN
Zombies do like the other other white meat. Huh. Speaking of, what do you care about zombies?

SAM
What do you mean?

DEAN
Well, you've been on soul-saving detail for months now. And we're three weeks out, and all of a sudden, you're interested in some hot zombie action?

SAM
Hey, man, you're the one who's been all gung ho to hunt. I just thought I'd be doing you a favor.

DEAN
Hey, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't say I didn't want to do it, okay. I mean obviously I want to hunt some zombies.

SAM
Okay, fine, whatever.

...............................

INTERIOR. CORONER'S LAB

DEAN and SAM stand listening.

CORONER
Yeah, the rest of the body was intact. The liver was the only organ missing.

DEAN
Now, where the liver was ripped out, did you happen to notice any...ah...teeth marks?

CORONER
(Giving them an 'are you insane' look) Can I see your badges?

SAM
Of course, sure.

CORONER
Fine. So you're cops and morons.

DEAN
Excuse me? No, no. We're very smart.

CORONER
The liver was not ripped out. It was removed. Surgically. By someone who knew their way around a scalpel. Didn't you read my report?

DEAN
Of course we did. Oh, it was riveting. It was a real page-turner, just delightful.

CORONER
You done?

DEAN
I think so.

CORONER
Please go away.

DEAN
Okay.

SAM
Sure.

..............................

EXTERIOR. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

Sam is smiling.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Nothing. So, that kind of punches a hole in our zombie theory, huh, that scalpel thing?

DEAN
Yeah, zombie with skills, "Dr. Quinn, medicine zombie".

SAM
Maybe we're on the wrong track, Dean, looking for hacked-up corpses.

DEAN
What should we be looking for?

SAM
Survivors. This isn't zombie lunch. This is organ theft.

...................................

INTERIOR. HOSPITAL ROOM

PATIENT
I told the cops all of this yesterday. I don't want to talk about it anymore.

SAM
It's just a couple of questions, sir.

PATIENT
Hey, man. I just got my kidney stolen. I'm tired.

DEAN
We'll be out of here quick. Don't you want to get the guy?

PATIENT
Will it get me back my kidney?

SAM
So what's the last thing you remember?

PATIENT
Feeding my meter. I got jumped from behind...and then I wake up strapped to a table. And then the worst pain you could possibly imagine, only worse. And then I black out again. Thank God. And then I wake up screaming in some no-tell motel in a bathtub full of ice.

DEAN
Do you remember anything about the surgery – you know, what the guy looked like, any details about the room?

PATIENT
Let me think about that. Yeah...one thing is coming back to me. You know what I remember? Getting my kidney cut out of my body!

.............................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM

SAM and DEAN sit at the table. SAM is using the laptop and DEAN is happily eating a burger.

SAM
So, I got a theory.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
Yeah, I talked to Mr. Giggle's doctor. Turns out his incisions were sewn up with silk.

DEAN
That's weird.

SAM
Yeah, nowadays it is, but silk used to be the suture of choice back in the early 19th century. It was really problematic. Patients would get massive infections. The death rate was insane.

DEAN
Good times.

SAM
Right, so doctors, they had to do whatever they could to keep infections from spreading. One way was maggots.

DEAN
Dude, I'm eating.

SAM
It actually kind of worked because maggots, they eat bad tissue, and they leave good tissue. And get this. When they found our guy, his body cavity was stuffed full of maggots.

DEAN
Dude, I'm eating! Alright, let me get this straight. So, people are getting ganked, right?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
A little "antiques roadshow" surgery, some organ theft. But why is this all sounding familiar?

SAM
Because you heard it before. When you were a kid... from Dad. Doc Benton...real-life doctor, lived in New Hampshire, brilliant and obsessed with alchemy, especially how to live forever. So, in 1816, Doc abandons his practice and...

DEAN
Right, yeah, nobody hears from him for like 20 years, and all of sudden, people start showing up dead.

SAM
Dead or – or missing an organ or the hand or some other kind of part.

DEAN
Cause whatever he was doing was actually working. He just kept on ticking. Parts would wear out, he'd replace them. But I thought Dad hunted him down and took his heart out.

SAM
Yeah, I guess the Doc must have plugged in a new one.

DEAN
All right, where's he doing the deed?

SAM
According to this, Benton's picky about where he sets up his lab. He likes dense forest with access to a river or stream or some kind of freshwater.

DEAN
(Taking another huge bite of his burger) Why?

SAM
Because that's where he likes to dump the bile and intestines and fecal matter. (DEAN looks disgusted and lowers his burger, gagging slightly) Lost your appetite yet?

DEAN considers this, looking at the burger and then at SAM, then back at the burger.

DEAN
(to his burger) Oh baby, I can't stay mad at you.

DEAN takes a huge bite, staring at SAM as he chews.

.............................

EXTERIOR. NIGHT

A jogger is abducted. He wakes up in Doc Benton's cabin, strapped to an operating table. Doc Benton carves open his chest and removes his heart as the man watches, horrified.

JOGGER
No, please. No. No, no.


END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXTERIOR SHOT - MOTEL - THE ERIE.

INTERIOR MOTEL ROOM

SAM and DEAN lean over a map on the bed.

SAM
(Pointing at map where some areas are circled in red) So these are all the cabins. Most of them have been abandoned for years.

DEAN
So what the hell are we waiting for?

DEAN'S phone rings. He answers.

DEAN
Bobby.

BOBBY
Hey. Think I finally got a bead on Bela.

DEAN
I'm listening.

BOBBY
Rufus Turner.

DEAN
Who's that? Like a Cleveland steamer?

BOBBY
He's a hunter, or he used to be.

DEAN
And now?

BOBBY
Hermit mostly. Does a little selling on the side. Anyway. I put the word out on Bela months ago. He just called. Said a woman got in touch, wanted to buy some things.

DEAN
And he thinks it's Bela?

BOBBY
British accent, went by the name Mina Chandler.

DEAN
She's used that before. Well, it's kinda of a sloppy move, isn't it? Getting in contact with one of your old friends.

BOBBY
Friend? Haven't laid eyes on him in fifteen years. He's not the Christmas card type. I doubt she knows I know him. Canaan, Vermont.

DEAN
Thanks, Bobby. We're on our way.

BOBBY
One other thing. Take a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.

DEAN
(To Bobby) Okay. (To Sam) Come on. We're going after Bela.

SAM
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.

DEAN
Come on. Get your stuff. The clock's ticking.

SAM
Look, I think we should stay here and finish the case.

DEAN
You insane?

SAM
Dean, there's no way she still has the Colt! That was months ago! She probably sold it the second she got it.

DEAN
Well, then I'll kill her. Win-win.

SAM
Dean...

DEAN
Sam. We're going!

SAM
No!

DEAN
Why the hell not?

SAM
Dean, this, this here. Now. This is what's gonna save you.

DEAN
What? Chasing some Frankenstein?

SAM
Chasing immortality. (DEAN stares at him, startled) Look, Benton can't die. We find out how he did it, we can do it to you.

DEAN
What are you talking about?

SAM
You have to die before you go to hell, right? So, if you can never die, then...

DEAN
Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Did you know that this was Doc Benton from the jump?

SAM
No. (DEAN stares at SAM, tilting his head in a question) Look, I was hoping.

DEAN
So the whole zombie thing, it was lying to me?

SAM
I didn't wanna say anything until I was sure, Dean. All I'm trying to do is find an answer here.

DEAN
No. What you're trying to do is chase Slicy McHackey here. And to kill him? No. You wanna buy him a freaking beer. You wanna study him.

SAM
I was just trying to help.

DEAN
You're not helping! You forget that if I welch on this deal, you die. Guess what, living forever is welching.

SAM
Fine! Then, whatever the magic pill is, I'll take it too!

DEAN
Oh, what is this? Sid and Nancy? No. It's just like Bobby's been saying. We kill the demon who owns the contract and this whole damn thing wipes clean. That's our best shot.

SAM
Even if you had the Colt, Dean, who are you gonna shoot? We have no idea who holds the ticket.

DEAN
Well, I'll shoot the hellhounds then before they slash me up. Now, you coming or not?

SAM
(Quietly) I'm staying here.

DEAN
No, you're not. 'Cause I'm not gonna let you wander out in the woods alone to track some organ stealing freak.

SAM
You're not gonna let me?

DEAN
No, I'm not gonna let you.

SAM
How are you gonna stop me? (Dean again looks startled) Look, man, we're trying to do the same thing here.

DEAN
I know. But I'm going. So if you wanna stay...stay.

DEAN watches SAM but SAM continues to stare at the wall. DEAN shrugs, puts his bag on his shoulder and heads over to open the door. SAM doesn't move.

DEAN
(Hesitating then turning back) Sammy, be careful.

SAM finally turns to face DEAN.

SAM

(Quietly) You too.

They stare are each other for a long moment, then DEAN reaches out and closes the door behind him. SAM lets out a huge sigh.

....................

CANAAN, VERMONT.

EXTERIOR. DAY.RUFUS TURNER'S HOUSE.

DEAN climbs the tall stairs onto the porch. A handwritten sign says "No solicitors, that means you! No asking for donations. No selling ANYTHING!"

DEAN rings the buzzer, then bangs on the security door. He hears a noise and looks up to see a security camera moving to train on him.

RUFUS
(via intercom) What?

We see a view of DEAN through the security camera.

DEAN
Hi, uh, Rufus?

RUFUS
Yeah, even if I am, the question is still the same. What?

DEAN
Uh, I'm Dean Winchester. I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.

RUFUS
So?

DEAN
You called him this morning.

RUFUS
So?

DEAN
Uh... (DEAN tries to grin at the security camera)...you told Bobby about a British chick who made contact with you.

RUFUS
And so?

DEAN
You know where she is?

RUFUS
Yeah.

DEAN
Great. Could you tell me where I could find her?

RUFUS
No.

DEAN
(To himself) Course not. (Out loud) Look, Rufus, man...

RUFUS
(Opening the door) Look, let me point something out to you. You are knocking at my door, so don't "Look, man" me. I'm not your man.

DEAN
I'm sorry, sir.

RUFUS
All right, let me tell you a little story. See, once upon a time, Bobby called me, asked me to call him if I got a whiff of this Bela Talbot. I got a whiff. I called. The end.

DEAN
Okay, yeah, if you could just tell me where she is, I mean, that would be great.

RUFUS
Dean Winchester, right?

DEAN
Yeah.

RUFUS
Dean, do I look like I'm here to help you?

DEAN
I'm gonna say no?

RUFUS
Then get the hell of my property.

DEAN
All right, yeah, fair enough. I got one more question for you, though. See, I got this, uh, this bottle of scotch, and... uh, is this considered good?

RUFUS eyes the bottle, eyes DEAN, and starts smiling.

........................

INTERIOR. RUFUS TURNER'S HOUSE

DEAN and RUFUS sit at the table with glasses in front of them. The bottle is three quarters empty.

DEAN
Bottoms up.

They click glasses and drink.

RUFUS
You know, I don't even bother drinking unless it's this stuff. Nectar of the Gods, I'm telling you.

DEAN
Yeah, it's a nice change, you know. Most of my whiskey comes from a plastic jug. (They both laugh) So, Bela was here because...

RUFUS
She wanted to buy a couple of things, which is gonna take me some time to round up.

DEAN
Where is she now?

RUFUS watches DEAN closely.

RUFUS
Can I ask you something?

DEAN
Sure.

RUFUS
You got three weeks left. Why are you wasting your time chasing after that skinny, stuck-up English girl?

DEAN
(Suspicious) How do you know about that?

RUFUS
(leaning forward) Because I know things. I know a lot of things about a lot of people.

DEAN
Is that so?

RUFUS
I know ain't no peashooter gonna save you.

DEAN
What makes you so sure?

RUFUS
Cause that's the job, kid. Even if you manage to scrape out of this one, there's just gonna be something else down the road. Folks like us...there ain't no happy ending. We all got it coming.

DEAN
Well, ain't you a bucket of sunshine?

RUFUS
I'm what you've got to look forward to if you survive. (Smirking and raising his glass again) But you won't.

.......................

EXTERIOR. DIRT ROAD. DAY.

SAM pulls over his rental car and turns off the engine. He checks his map again, gets out of the car and starts walking into the forest.

........................

INTERIOR. RUFUS'S CABIN.

DEAN
So, Bela...

RUFUS
(By now quite drunk) Hotel Canaan. Room 39. But watch your back.

DEAN
I think I can handle Bela.

RUFUS
Oh, don't be so sure about that. There are things that you don't know about her.

DEAN
Oh, and you do? Right. Because you know things.

RUFUS
(Superior) Yep.

DEAN
And let me guess...you lift her fingerprint?

RUFUS
Yep.

DEAN
And that got you jack.

RUFUS
Yep. She burnt them off. Probably years ago.

DEAN
Yeah, so you're right where we are.

RUFUS
Nope. (DEAN looks at him funny) You do her ear?

DEAN
Sorry?

RUFUS
You do her ear?

DEAN
Hey, man, I'll try anything once, but I don't know. That sounds uncomfortable.

RUFUS
Ears are as unique to humans as fingerprints.

DEAN
No kidding.

RUFUS
Of course, that don't fly in the courts over here, but in England, they're all over it. A friend of a friend...of a friend faxed me 10 pages of confidential files within a day. All I had to send him was one clean shot off the security camera.

DEAN
Right. One clean shot of her ear.

RUFUS
(Handing Dean a folder) The so-called Bela Talbot.

...............................

INTERIOR. DOC BENTON'S CABIN. NIGHT.

SAM enters with a torch in and looks around. He finds a journal and pockets it. He moves to the cellar. A man's dead body is lying on the operating table. He keeps looking around, hears a slight noise and through ragged curtains sees another body. He moves closer. A woman is strapped down an another the operating table, her arm stretched out beside her and covered in maggots. She is missing skin. SAM leans in to place his fingers on the pulse point of her neck. The woman gasps and her eyes spring open. SAM startles violently.

SAM
Shh! Shh! Shh! It's okay. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm gonna help you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

SAM grabs a cloth and wraps it around her arm, shhing her the whole time.

SAM
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

They hear a door open upstairs. The woman starts crying, unable to help herself. SAM covers her mouth but DOC BENTON hears and starts down the stairs with a lamp to investigate. The woman and SAM are gone. DOC BENTON looks up to see a window open.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXTERIOR. NIGHT. DOC BENTON'S CABIN

SAM carries the victim to his rental car.

SAM
(placing her in the passenger seat) Okay, watch your head, watch your head. Sorry.

SAM runs around and gets into the driver's seat. BENTON comes out of nowhere, grabs SAM's head and slams it against the wheel. SAM reverses wildly, his passenger screaming. He changes gear and floors it, driving straight over BENTON. As the car speeds away BENTON rises and looks after them, his head at a crazy angle.

.............

INTERIOR. BELA'S HOTEL ROOM

BELA enters, turning to close the door behind her. DEAN pushes her back against the door. He lays his arm across her throat and points his gun at her face.

DEAN
Where's the Colt?

BELA
(Calmly) Dean.

DEAN
No extra words.

BELA
It's long gone, across the world by now.

DEAN
You're lying.

He grabs her bag from her hand to look in it.

BELA
I'll call the buyer. Speak Farsi?

DEAN grabs her around the waist, pulling her against him.

BELA
What the hell are you...

DEAN quickly frisks her, finds her gun and holds it up to her.

DEAN
Don't flatter yourself.

DEAN uses the point of his gun to snap on the room's lights, then points it at her again.

DEAN
Don't move.

DEAN begins searching the room, leaving BELA standing against the door.

BELA
I told you I don't have it.

DEAN
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely gonna take your word for it.

DEAN turns his back and continues rifling through her drawers. BELA slides along the wall toward the door. A bullet goes through the door, inches from her head. She freezes.

DEAN
Don't move.

DEAN continues searching.

BELA
It's gone. Get on a plane if you must. Track down the buyer. You might catch up to him eventually.

DEAN finishes searching and returns to BELA, taking a stance and pointing his gun at her head.

BELA
Are you going to kill me?

DEAN
Oh, yeah.

BELA
You're not the cold-blooded type.

DEAN
You mean like you? That's true. See, I couldn't imagine killing my parents.

BELA
(Shocked but regrouping) I don't know what you're talking...

DEAN
Yes, you do. You were, what, 14? Folks died in some shady car accident. Police suspected a slashed brake line, but it was all too crispy to tell. Cut to little Bela...Oh, I'm sorry, Abby...inheriting millions.

BELA
How did you even...

DEAN
Doesn't matter.

FLASHBACK

Young Abby is sitting on her bed, crying. A man slowly walks into the room and turns to close the door. She looks terrified.

BELA
They were lovely people. And I killed them. And I got rich. I can't be bothered to give a damn. Just like I don't care what happens to you.

DEAN pushes her roughly against the door with his arm across her throat again. A strand of woven herbs is dislodged from the ledge above the door but no one notices.

DEAN
(Staring for a long tense moment.) You make me sick.

BELA
Likewise.

DEAN takes a step back and again points his gun at her head, smirking. She stares back, then closes her eyes. Dean is distracted and looks up, spying the herbs hanging over the ledge. He looks back at her, thinking. BELA opens her eyes as DEAN drops the gun.

DEAN
You're not worth it.

DEAN drags her aside and leaves. BELA lifts her hand which now has a scrap of paper in it. She looks at it, a motel receipt, The Erie. She grabs her phone.

BELA
It worked. He found me. No, Sam wasn't with him. But I know where they are.

...........................

INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM

(Sam's phone rings, he picks up)

SAM
Dean.

DEAN
(in the Impala) Yeah.

SAM
Did you get the Colt?

DEAN
What do you think?

SAM
So, does that mean Bela is, uh...

DEAN
No, no, she deserves to die a dozen times over, but I couldn't do it.

SAM
Dean...

DEAN
I'm really screwed, Sammy.

SAM
No, you're just...

DEAN
But you were right. Bela was a goose chase. The Colt's gone, and this time I'm really screwed, Sam.

SAM
Maybe not. Look, Dean, I found Benton's cabin.

DEAN
You okay? Was he there?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Did you kill him?

SAM
No.

DEAN
What do you mean, "no"?

SAM
Dean, please just listen for a second. I found his lab book, and it has the formula.

DEAN
What, the live-forever formula?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Great, let me guess. I got to drink blood out of a baby's skull?

SAM
No, that's the thing. It's not black magic. There's no blood sacrifice or anything. It's just science, Dean. Very, very extremely weird science, but...

DEAN
Wait, wait, wait. What are...What are you saying? You think...

SAM
Dean, I think it might be doable. I mean, I know we've hit a lot of walls, but I...I think this formula, I think it might be it. This could save you.

DEAN
Okay, so, this formula...

SAM
Well, I mean, look, look, we're not in the clear yet. There are still things that I don't get...

An arm comes from behind SAM and covers his mouth with a rag. SAM drops the phone. It is DOC BENTON.

DEAN
Sam? Sammy!

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INTERIOR. DOC BENTON'S CABIN

SAM is strapped to an operating table. His eyes are taped open.

DOC BENTON
You can relax. It's all gonna be okay. Ain't nothing gonna happen here that you got to worry about, Sammy. Your chances of coming out of this procedure alive? Very, very high.

SAM
How do you know my name?

DOC BENTON
Oh...I know. You think I'm some kind of monster, don't you? Well, I got to tell you, I have never done one thing that I did not have to do. This whole eternal-life thing is very high-maintenance. If something goes bad, like my eyes here...you got to replace them. And sometimes things get damaged, like when your father cut out my heart. Now, that...That was very inconvenient. So, I'm sure that you can understand all the joy I felt when I read all about myself here in his journal. Kind of makes this whole thing just feel like some kind of family reunion, don't it? Well, I guess it's about time that we get this thing started.

DOC BENTON brings his scoop very close to SAM'S eye. Three shots ring out, shooting DOC BENTON from behind. He turns and sees DEAN.

DOC BENTON
Shoot all you want.

DOC BENTON approaches and DEAN lets loose two more bullets. DOC BENTON throws DEAN into the wall and he falls to the ground. DOC BENTON approaches again, leaning down. DEAN plunges a knife into DOC BENTON'S chest.

DOC BENTON
(Laughing) A knife? What part of immortality do you not understand? Pity about the heart, though. It was a brand-new one.

DEAN
Good. It should be pumping nice and strong...(DEAN holds up a bottle of chloroform) Sending this stuff throughout your whole body. See, I picked up your little bottle upstairs and dipped the knife in it.

DOC BENTON collapses.

..............................

DOC BENTON awakes strapped to the operating table. DEAN and SAM stand over him.

DEAN
Oh, hiya, Doc. Wakey, wakey, eggs and bac-y.

DOC BENTON
Please.

DEAN
Please what? You've been killing poor bastards for over 150 years and now you got a request? Shut up.

DOC BENTON
No, you don't understand. I can help you. I know what you need.

DEAN
We might have to cut him up into little bits. You know, this immortality thing is a bitch.

DOC BENTON
I can read the formula for you. You know...immortality...Forever young, never die.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN
Sam.

SAM walks out of the room, indicating DEAN should follow.

DEAN
What?

SAM
I mean, we're talking hell in three weeks. Or needing a new pancreas in like half a century.

DEAN
Yeah, well, you can't exactly get those at a Kwik-E-Mart.

SAM
It's not perfect, but it buys us more time to think of something better. We just need time, Dean. I mean, please, just...just think about it.

DEAN
No.

SAM
Dean, don't you want to live?

DEAN
What he is isn't living. Look, this is simple.

SAM
Simple?

DEAN
To me it is, okay. Black or white; human, not human. (DEAN walks back to stand in front of DOC BENTON) See, what the Doc is is a freakin' monster. I can't do it. I would rather go to hell.

DOC BENTON
(Calling out) You don't understand. I can help you!

DEAN covers a rag with more chloroform and places it over DOC BENTON'S mouth.

DEAN
Now, I'm gonna take care of him. You can either help me or not. It's up to you.

.........................


DOC BENTON wakes and lights a match. He is in a box. He can't get the lid open.

Camera switches to viewing the box from the outside. It is a refrigerator laid in a hole in the ground. The DOC'S book lies on top.

DOC BENTON
No! No! Don't! Stop it! I can help you! No!

DEAN
Enjoy forever in there, Doc.

DEAN and SAM begin shovelling in the hole.

DOC BENTON
Let me out! I can save you! No. Don't.

END ACT FOUR


ACT FIVE
INTERIOR. MOTEL ROOM HALLWAY.

BELA slowly walks down the hallway and picks the lock on a door. She removes a gun from her jacket and quietly enters. She raises the gun and puts two bullets into the bodies lying under the covers on each bed, then moves closer, turning on a bedside lamp. A clock beside the lamp shows it is 11.56 pm.

BELA pulls back the covers to find a sex doll slowly deflating. She checks the other bed, another sex doll. The phone rings and she quickly picks it up.

DEAN
Hiya, Bela. Here's a fun fact you may not know. I felt your hand in my pocket, when you swiped that motel receipt.

BELA
You don't understand.

DEAN
(in the car with SAM) Oh, I'm pretty sure I understand perfectly. See, I noticed something interesting in your hotel room. Something tucked above the door. An herb. Devil's shoestring? There's only one use for that. Holding hellhounds at bay. So you know what I did, I went back and I took another look at your folks' obit. Turns out they died ten years ago today. You didn't kill them. A demon did your dirty work. You made a deal, didn't you, Bela. And it's come due.

FLASHBACK.

BELA sits on a swing. A little girl sits beside her, very self-possessed.

GIRL
I can take care of them for you. And it won't even cost you anything...for ten whole years.

The little girl's eyes turn red, then go back to normal.

END FLASHBACK.

DEAN
Is that why you stole the Colt, huh? Try to wiggle out of your deal, our gun for your soul?

BELA
Yes.

DEAN
But stealing the Colt wasn't quite enough, I'm guessing.

BELA
They changed the deal. They wanted me to kill Sam.

DEAN
Really! Wow, demons untrustworthy. Shocker. That's, uh, kind of a tight deadline too – what time is it? Well, look at that, almost midnight.

BELA
(Crying) Dean, listen, I need help.

DEAN
Sweetheart, we are weeks past help.

BELA
I know I don't deserve it.

DEAN
You know what, you're right, you don't. But you know what the bitch of the bunch is? If you would have just come to us sooner and asked for help we probably could have taken the Colt and saved you.

BELA
I know, and saved yourself. I know about your deal, Dean.

DEAN
And who told you that?

BELA
The Demon that holds it. She holds mine too. She said she holds every deal.

DEAN
She?

BELA
Her name's Lilith.

DEAN
Lilith? Why should I believe you?

BELA
You shouldn't but it's the truth.

DEAN
This can't help you, Bela, not now. Why you telling me this?

BELA
Because just maybe you can kill the bitch.

DEAN
I'll see you in hell.

DEAN hangs up.

BELA sits on the bed listening to the dial tone. She hangs up and takes a deep breath just as the clock clicks over to midnight. A deep howling starts in the distance, then closer vicious growls begin.
