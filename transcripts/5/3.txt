PROLOGUE
EXT. GREAT PLAINS MOTEL – NIGHT

INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

SAM lies in an otherwise empty bed, shirtless and trying to sleep. He opens his eyes, sighs, and rolls over. He sits up and sees JESS beside him.

JESS
Hey, baby.

SAM stares.

JESS
I missed you.

SAM keeps staring.

SAM
Jessica. I'm dreaming.

JESS
Or you're not. What's the difference? I'm here.

SAM
I miss you so much.

JESS
I know.

JESS reaches out to take SAM's hand.

JESS
I miss you too. What are you doing, Sam?

SAM
What do you mean?

JESS
Running away. Haven't we been down this road before?

SAM
No. It's different now.

JESS
Really?

SAM
Last time I wanted to be normal. This time I know I'm a freak.

JESS
Which is all a big ball of semantics. You know that.

SAM
No.

JESS
Even at Stanford you knew. You knew there was something dark inside of you. Deep down, maybe, but you knew. Maybe that's what got me killed.

SAM looks up, startled.

SAM
No.

JESS
I was dead from the moment we said hello.

SAM
No.

JESS
Don't you get it? You can't run from yourself. Why are you running now?

SAM
Why are you here, Jess?

JESS
Would you believe I'm actually trying to protect you?

SAM
From what?

JESS
You. Sooner or later the past is going to catch up to you like it always does. You know what happens then?

SAM looks down.

JESS
People die. Baby, the people closest to you die.

SAM
Don't worry because I won't make that mistake again.

JESS
Same song, different verse. Things are never gonna change with you. Ever.

SAM looks down, then back up. JESS is gone.

DEAN'S MOTEL ROOM
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN dampens a washcloth in the motel room sink and starts to clean his jacket. CASTIEL appears behind him. DEAN sees him in the mirror and startles.

DEAN
God.

DEAN thumps the sink.

DEAN
Don't do that.

CASTIEL
Hello, Dean.

DEAN turns around; CASTIEL is inches from him.

DEAN
Cas, we've talked about this. Personal space?

CASTIEL
My apologies.

CASTIEL steps back. DEAN grabs his jacket and walks toward the bed.

Co-Producer

DEAN
How'd you find me? I thought I was flying below the angel radar.

DEAN rubs his ribs to illustrate the point.

CASTIEL looks around the motel room, which has no signs of SAM's presence, not even a second bed.

CASTIEL
Where's Sam?

DEAN puts on his jacket without looking at CASTIEL.

DEAN

CASTIEL

I've heard whispers that he's walking the earth. This is a rare opportunity.

DEAN
For what? Revenge?

CASTIEL

DEAN
So, what, you think you can find this dude and he's just gonna spill God's address?

ERIC KRIPKE

CASTIEL
Yes, because we are gonna trap him and interrogate him.

DEAN pauses and turns back.

DEAN
You're serious about this.

CASTIEL turns around to face DEAN. DEAN drops the washcloth and walks back toward CASTIEL.

CASTIEL stares at DEAN, confused. DEAN goes around CASTIEL and does something offscreen with the knife.

DEAN
Give me one good reason why I should do this.

CASTIEL
Because you're Michael's vessel and no angel will dare harm you.

DEAN looks at CASTIEL.

DEAN
Oh, so I'm your bullet shield.

CASTIEL
I need your help because you are the only one who'll help me. Please.

DEAN considers.

DEAN
All right, fine. Where is he?

CASTIEL
Maine. Let's go.

CASTIEL reaches to touch DEAN's forehead with two fingers. DEAN leans away.

DEAN
Whoa.

CASTIEL removes his hand.

CASTIEL
What?

DEAN
Last time you zapped me someplace I didn't poop for a week. We're driving.

BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

LINDSEY is throwing darts; they land near the center of the target. SAM is at the bar next to the BARTENDER.

LINDSEY
Hey Keith, you play?

SAM
That depends. What are we playing for?

LINDSEY
World peace.

SAM
Oh, is that all?

LINDSEY
Can I ask you something?

SAM
Shoot.

SAM wipes his hands off on a cloth and tosses it at the bar. LINDSEY retrieves her darts.

LINDSEY
You finished that crossword puzzle in the kitchen?

SAM
Uh, I guess. Why?

LINDSEY
The New York Times Saturday crossword?

SAM looks down.

SAM
Was it?

LINDSEY
Uh-huh. You blow into town last week, you don't talk to anybody, you're obviously highly educated. You're like this...

SAM
Riddle wrapped inside an enigma wrapped inside a taco?

LINDSEY nods, smiling.

LINDSEY
Here's what we play for. When I win, you buy me dinner and tell me your life story.

SAM
Sounds fair.

NEWS ANCHOR JOHN (on TV in background)
—last year alone, standards of ??? and see how that turns out—

SAM throws all three darts into the center of the target.

NEWS ANCHOR JOHN
And now ??? with ???—

LINDSEY
Very mysterioso.

NEWS ANCHOR JOHN
Spring hail, lightning strikes, and now fire—

LINDSEY
I like it.

SAM's attention is on KPJT 6 News on the TV, which shifts from one video of a hailstorm to another, then to video of trees on fire, then to the REPORTER live with fire and firemen in the background. While the REPORTER is onscreen, so is a box that says "LIVE REPORT" next to a scrollbar repeating "FIRE CONSUMES TOWN, RESIDENTS FORCED TO EVACUATE..."

REPORTER
—the town of Tully? tonight, John. Locals say that what started as a torrential hailstorm late this afternoon suddenly turned to massive lightning strikes that triggered the fires now consuming more than twenty acres here along the Route 17 corridor. County officials are advising all Tully residents to prepare for what could become mandatory evacuations.

The BARTENDER shuts the TV off.

BARTENDER
Damn. Is it me or does it seem like it's the end of the world?

SAM looks away.

WATERVILLE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
EXT. STREET – DAY

DEAN and CASTIEL get out of the Impala.

Waterville, Maine

DEAN
And we're here why?

CASTIEL
A deputy sheriff laid eyes on the archangel.

DEAN
And he still has eyes? All right, what's the plan?

CASTIEL
We'll...tell the officer that he witnessed an angel of the Lord, and the officer will tell us where the angel is.

DEAN
Seriously? You're going to walk in there and tell him the truth?

CASTIEL
Why not?

DEAN
Because we're humans.

DEAN pulls out another fake ID and stashes it inside CASTIEL's coat, then adjusts CASTIEL's coat and tie.

DEAN
And when humans want something really, really bad, we lie.

CASTIEL
Why?

DEAN
Because that's how you become President.

INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT – DAY

DEAN
Deputy Framingham?

The DEPUTY turns around. DEAN holds up an FBI ID.

DEAN
Hi. Alonzo Mosely, FBI. This is my partner, Eddie Moscone.

CASTIEL does nothing.

DEAN
Also FBI.

CASTIEL does nothing. DEAN stares at him. CASTIEL catches on and pulls out his FBI ID, which he displays upside-down. DEAN turns it over for him.

DEAN
He's, uh, he's new. Mind if we ask you a few questions?

CASTIEL looks at the ID, curious.

FRAMINGHAM
Yeah, sure. Talk here, though.

FRAMINGHAM indicates his right ear, leading DEAN and CASTIEL to his office.

FRAMINGHAM
Hearing's all blown to hell in this one.

DEAN
That happen recently?

FRAMINGHAM
Yeah. Gas station. Why you're here, isn't it?

DEAN
Yes, it is.

They all sit down.

DEAN
You mind just, uh, running us through what happened?

FRAMINGHAM
A call came in. Disturbance out at the Pump and Go on Route 4.

DEAN
What kind of disturbance?

FRAMINGHAM
Would not have believed my eyes if I hadn't seen it myself. We're talking a riot. Full scale.

DEAN
How many?

FRAMINGHAM
Thirty, forty, in all-out kill-or-be-killed combat?

DEAN
Any idea what set them off?

CASTIEL
It's angels and demons, probably.

FRAMINGHAM looks at CASTIEL. CASTIEL looks back.

CASTIEL
They're skirmishing all over the globe.

FRAMINGHAM
Come again?

FRAMINGHAM turns back to DEAN.

FRAMINGHAM
What did he say?

DEAN and CASTIEL speak simultaneously.

DEAN
Nothing. Nothing.

CASTIEL
Demons. Demons.

CASTIEL shuts up.

DEAN
Demons, you know, drink, adultery. We all have our demons, Walt.

FRAMINGHAM looks back and forth.

FRAMINGHAM
I guess.

DEAN looks at CASTIEL.

DEAN
Anyway.

DEAN returns his attention to FRAMINGHAM.

DEAN
What happened next?

FRAMINGHAM
Freaking explosion, that's what. They said it was one of those underground gas tanks, but, uh, I don't think so.

DEAN
Why not?

FRAMINGHAM
Wasn't your usual fireball. It was, um—

CASTIEL
Pure white.

FRAMINGHAM
Yeah. Gas station was leveled. Everyone was...it was just horrible. And I see this one guy, kneeling, real focused-like, not a damn scratch on him.

DEAN
You know him?

FRAMINGHAM
Donnie Finneman. Mechanic there.

DEAN
Let me guess, he just, uh, vanished into thin air?

FRAMINGHAM
Uh, no, Kolchak. He's down at Saint Pete's.

CASTIEL turns to DEAN.

CASTIEL
Saint Pete's.

DEAN
Thank you.

ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

DONNIE is sitting in a wheelchair, catatonic. DEAN and CASTIEL observe him from the hallway window.

DEAN
I take it that's not Raphael anymore.

CASTIEL
Just an empty vessel.

DEAN
So is this what I'm looking at if Michael jumps in my bones?

CASTIEL
No, not at all. Michael is much more powerful. It'll be far worse for you.

DEAN looks away.

PHONE CONVERSATION
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

SAM has his laptop open to a calligraphed page of the Book of Revelation in Latin. SAM highlights a section and magnifies it, then picks up the phone and scrolls past Adele, Alana, Bobby, Butcher, Cassidy, Cory, Courtenay, Dan, Darilyn, and Deborah to Dean. He stares at the highlighted number for a moment, (212) 555-0113, and scrolls up to Bobby.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE – NIGHT alternating with INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

The phone rings. BOBBY answers.

BOBBY
Sam?

SAM
Hey Bobby. How you doing?

BOBBY
Well I ain't running any marathons, but I'll live.

SAM laughs.

BOBBY
Where are you?

SAM
Uh, Garber, Oklahoma. I found a town up the road showing some Revelation omens.

BOBBY
What omens?

SAM
All right, listen to this. 'And upon his rising there shall be hail and fire mixed with blood.'

BOBBY
Well ain't that delightful.

SAM
Yeah. But we already got hailstorms and fire so I'm guessing blood can't be too far behind.

BOBBY
Okay.

SAM
What?

BOBBY
There a reason you're calling?

SAM
Dean didn't tell you?

BOBBY
He told me.

SAM
Yeah. So I just thought you might want to find out who's in the area and put a man on this.

BOBBY
Okay, let me see if I can think of the best hunter who might be in the immediate vicinity—oh, that'd be you.

SAM
I can't, Bobby, I'm sitting this one out.

BOBBY
Sam—

SAM
I gotta go. I'm so sorry.

BOBBY
Hold on, Sam—

SAM hangs up. BOBBY throws down the phone.

ACT TWO
ABANDONED HOUSE
INT. HOUSE – DAY

DEAN walks through the empty cabin, paging through John's journal. He sets it down on the table and turns. CASTIEL is there, holding a ceramic jar.

DEAN
Where've you been?

CASTIEL
Jerusalem.

DEAN
Oh, how was it?

CASTIEL
Arid.

CASTIEL sets the jar on the table.

DEAN
What's that?

CASTIEL
It's oil. It's very special. Very rare.

CASTIEL sits down.

DEAN
Okay, so we trap Raphael with a nice vinaigrette?

CASTIEL
No.

DEAN
So this ritual of yours, when does it got to go down?

CASTIEL
Sunrise.

DEAN
Tell me something. You keep saying we're gonna trap this guy. Isn't that kinda like trapping a hurricane with a butterfly net?

CASTIEL
No, it's harder.

DEAN
Do we have any chance of surviving this?

CASTIEL
You do.

DEAN
So odds are you're a dead man tomorrow.

CASTIEL
Yes.

DEAN
Well. Last night on earth. What are your plans?

CASTIEL
I just thought I'd sit here quietly.

DEAN
Come on, anything? Booze, women?

CASTIEL looks at DEAN and away, uncomfortable.

DEAN
You have been with women before. Right? Or an angel, at least?

CASTIEL rubs the back of his neck.

DEAN
You mean to tell me you've never been up there doing a little cloud-seeding?

CASTIEL
Look, I've never had occasion, okay?

DEAN
All right.

DEAN grabs his jacket.

DEAN
Let me tell you something. There are two things I know for certain. One, Bert and Ernie are gay. Two, you are not gonna die a virgin. Not on my watch. Let's go.

DEAN leaves. CASTIEL stares after him, then follows.

BAR
INT. BAR - NIGHT

A patron plays pool. SAM takes a tray of empty glasses and trash.

MAN
Hey, Sam.

SAM ignores him.

MAN
Sam.

LINDSEY
Sam? What happened to Keith?

SAM puts down the tray and looks over.

SAM
Wait, what?

LINDSEY gestures at the MAN, whose name is TIM, and his two companions, REGGIE and STEVE.

LINDSEY
He called you Sam.

SAM
Yeah. Uh. Sam's my middle name.

LINDSEY laughs.

LINDSEY
Keith Sam? Man, I'm sorry.

TIM
Well, actually, it's Samuel, so it's not quite as dumb as it sounds.

LINDSEY
Are you guys friends?

STEVE
Hunting buddies. With his dad. Samuel here is quite the hunter himself.

LINDSEY
Wow. You killed deer and things?

TIM
Yeah, and things.

SAM
Um. Why don't I get you guys some drinks?

The three hunters sit at a table. SAM puts beers in front of them and takes the fourth seat.

TIM
Sorry. Didn't mean to bust you back there.

SAM
No. It's all right. So what's up?

TIM
Bobby called.

SAM
And?

TIM
You were right. Major demon block party going on.

SAM
But why? What are they up to?

STEVE
Don't know yet.

REGGIE
Bobby told us you were off limits. That true?

SAM
Yeah, that's right.

TIM
That's fine in theory and all, but we could really use all hands on deck here.

SAM
I know you could. But I can't. I'm sorry.

STEVE
Why not?

SAM
It's personal.

TIM
Look, man, what baggage is so heavy it can't be stowed away for the freaking apocalypse?

SAM
Like I said—

REGGIE
Yeah. You're sorry. Heard it the first time.

TIM
Suit yourself. More for us then, right?

SAM
Good luck.

TIM
But hey. Beers are on you when we get back.

SAM
Yeah, you bet.

LINDSEY
So your parents were drunk when they named you and you shoot Bambi?

SAM
It's a long story.

LINDSEY
That is it. Enough with the kung fu wandering the earth thing. I'm gonna buy you dinner and we're gonna talk.

SAM
Lindsey, I can't.

LINDSEY
No. The only way to avoid bloodshed is to say yes.

BROTHEL
INT. BROTHEL BAR – NIGHT

DEAN drinks. CASTIEL looks terrified.

DEAN
Hey. Relax.

CASTIEL
This is a den of iniquity. I should not be here.

DEAN
Dude, you full-on rebelled against heaven. Iniquity is one of the perks.

A HOOKER approaches. DEAN notices.

DEAN
Showtime.

HOOKER
Hi. What's your name?

CASTIEL tries not to look at her.

DEAN
Cas.

CASTIEL startles.

DEAN
His name is Cas. What's your name?

HOOKER
Chastity.

DEAN
Chastity.

CASTIEL drinks his beer.

DEAN
Wow. Is that kismet or what, buddy? Well, he likes you, you like him, so dayenu.

CHASTITY tugs CASTIEL up.

CHASTITY
Come on, baby.

DEAN catches CASTIEL on the way past.

DEAN
Hey, listen. Take this.

DEAN holds out a handful of money.

DEAN
If she asks for a credit card, no. Now just stick to the basics, okay? Do not order off the menu. Go get her, tiger.

CASTIEL stays still.

DEAN
Don't make me push you.

CASTIEL takes the money and turns to follow CHASTITY. Another HOOKER walks past; DEAN follows her. She and DEAN clink glasses at the bar.

DEAN
Well, cheers to you.

A scream offscreen. DEAN goes to investigate.

INT. BROTHEL BACK CORRIDOR – NIGHT

CHASTITY
Get out of my face! Leave me alone! Bastard! Screw you, jerk!

She throws something at CASTIEL, who is a little disheveled.

CHASTITY
I'll kill you!

She storms past DEAN.

CHASTITY
Screw you too! God! Oh! Jerk!

DEAN approaches CASTIEL.

DEAN
The hell did you do?

CASTIEL
I don't know. I just looked her in the eyes and told her it wasn't her fault that her father Gene ran off. It was because he hated his job at the post office.

DEAN
Oh, no, man.

CASTIEL
What?

DEAN
This whole industry runs on absent fathers. It's, it's the natural order.

Two BOUNCERS enter from the door CHASTITY left through.

DEAN
We should go. Come on.

He and CASTIEL head for the door at the opposite end of the corridor.

EXT. ALLEY – NIGHT

DEAN is laughing as he closes the door behind himself and CASTIEL.

CASTIEL
What's so funny?

DEAN
Oh, nothing. Whoo. It's been a long time since I've laughed that hard. It's been more than a long time. Years.

DEAN's face falls as he realizes.

BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

SAM and LINDSEY are sitting at a table, eating.

LINDSEY
So...you gonna tell me who those guys back there really were? And don't say hunting buddies.

SAM
Okay. Um. We used to be in the same business together.

LINDSEY
What business?

SAM
How's your salad?

LINDSEY
Witness protection, right? You're Mafia?

SAM
I'm not Mafia.

LINDSEY
Okay, I get it. Don't mean to pry, my bad.

SAM
I used to be in business with my brother. Truth is I was pretty good at the job. But...I made some mistakes, I did some stuff I'm not so proud of, and people got hurt. A lot of people.

LINDSEY
What was your poison?

SAM
Sorry?

LINDSEY
Come on. You were hooked on something, I know the look.

LINDSEY pulls a medallion out of her pocket.

LINDSEY
Three years sober.

SAM
You work in a bar.

LINDSEY
So do you. Look, Keith. I don't know you and I'm the last person to be giving advice, but I do know that no one has ever done anything so bad that they can't be forgiven. That they can't change.

ACT THREE
ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY

A nurse walks down the hallway. DEAN watches her go and slips into the room, shutting the door behind him and closing the shades. CASTIEL is already inside; he pours the oil in a circle around DONNIE's wheelchair.

CASTIEL
When the oil burns, no angel can touch or pass through the flames, or he dies.

DEAN
Okay, so we trap him in a steel cage of holy fire, but one question. How the hell do we get him here?

CASTIEL
Very simple. There's, well, almost an open phone line between a vessel and his angel. One just has to know how to dial.

CASTIEL leans down to DONNIE's ear and chants in Enochian.

CASTIEL
I'm here, Raphael. Come and get me, you little bastard.

CASTIEL leaves the oil circle.

DEAN
Just out of curiosity, what is the average customer wait time to speak to an archangel?

CASTIEL
Be ready.

CASTIEL lights a match and drops it on the oil, which bursts into a ring of flame.

ABANDONED HOUSE
EXT. ROAD – NIGHT

DEAN and CASTIEL drive up to a house.

DEAN
Well that's a day I'll never get back.

INT. HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN and CASTIEL enter the house.

CASTIEL
Dean, wait.

Bright light.

DONNIE is already inside the cabin, flaring with lightning in the shape of wings; now he is RAPHAEL. Lightbulbs shatter.

RAPHAEL
Castiel.

CASTIEL
Raphael.

CASTIEL and DEAN walk closer.

DEAN
And I thought you were supposed to be impressive. All you do is black out the room.

RAPHAEL
And the Eastern Seaboard.

Lightning flashes outside.

RAPHAEL
It is a testament to my unending mercy that I do not smite you here and now.

DEAN
Or maybe you're full of crap. Maybe you're afraid God will bring Cas back to life again and smite you and your candy-ass skirt. By the way, hi, I'm Dean.

RAPHAEL
I know who you are. And now, thanks to him, I know where you are.

CASTIEL
You won't kill him. You wouldn't dare.

RAPHAEL
But I will take him to Michael.

DEAN
Well then. Sounds terrifying. It does. But, uh, hate to tell you, I'm not going anywhere with you.

DEAN grabs a beer.

RAPHAEL
Surely you remember Zachariah giving you stomach cancer?

DEAN
Yeah, that was, that was hilarious.

RAPHAEL
Well, he doesn't have anything close to my imagination.

DEAN
Yeah? I bet you didn't imagine one thing.

RAPHAEL
What?

DEAN
We knew you were coming, you stupid son of a bitch.

DEAN lights his lighter and drops it. Holy oil ignites in a circle around RAPHAEL.

DEAN
Don't look at me, it was his idea.

CASTIEL
Where is He?

RAPHAEL
God? Didn't you hear? He's dead, Castiel. Dead.

BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

SAM wipes down a table. The door chimes open and someone comes in.

SAM
Bar's closed.

SAM turns around.

SAM
Hey.

TIM
Something you want to tell me, Sam?

SAM
What? No.

TIM
You sure about that?

SAM
I—I don't know—jeez. Are you okay? Where are Reggie and Steve?

TIM
Oh, Steve's good, he's, uh, his guts are lying roadside outside the Hawley Five and Dime.

SAM
I'm sorry.

TIM
Sorry don't cut it, Sam.

SAM
What do you want me to say?

TIM
The truth.

SAM says nothing.

TIM
Okay, fine. Let me give you some of my own, then. We go into town, we catch ourselves a demon, we get jumped by ten more. Steve bought it.

SAM
I'm sorry.

TIM
Saying it twice don't make it so, Sam. You see, this demon, he, uh, he told us things. Crazy things, things about you, Sam.

SAM
Demons lie.

TIM
Yeah. I'm gonna ask you one last time. The truth. Now.

The door chimes again. REGGIE comes in, hauling LINDSEY.

SAM
Lindsey!

REGGIE holds a knife to LINDSEY's neck.

LINDSEY
What's going on?

ACT FOUR
ABANDONED HOUSE
INT. HOUSE – NIGHT

RAPHAEL
But there's no other explanation. He's gone for good.

CASTIEL
You're lying.

RAPHAEL
Am I? Do you remember the twentieth century? Think the twenty-first is going any better? Do you think God would have let any of that happen if He were alive?

DEAN
Oh yeah? Well then who invented the Chinese basket trick?

RAPHAEL
Careful. That's my Father you're talking about, boy.

DEAN
Yeah, who would be so proud to know His sons started the frigging apocalypse.

RAPHAEL
Who ran off and disappeared. Who left no instructions and a world to run.

DEAN
Daddy ran away and disappeared. He didn't happen to work for the post office, did He?

RAPHAEL
This is funny to you? You're living in a godless universe.

DEAN
And? What, you and the other kids just decided to throw an apocalypse while He was gone?

RAPHAEL
We're tired. We just want it to be over. We just want...paradise.

DEAN
So, what, God dies and makes you the boss and you decide you can do whatever you want?

RAPHAEL
Yes. And whatever we want, we get.

The windows burst in.

Just take it easy, okay? Put the knife down.

REGGIE puts the knife down on the bar but keeps hold of LINDSEY.

SAM
It's true. What the demons said, it's all true.

TIM
Keep going.

SAM
Why? You gonna hate me any less? Am I gonna hate myself any less? What do you want?

TIM
I want to hear you say it.

SAM
I did it. I started the apocalypse.

ABANDONED HOUSE
INT. HOUSE – NIGHT

CASTIEL
If God is dead, why have I returned? Who brought me back?

RAPHAEL
Did it ever occur to you that maybe Lucifer raised you?

CASTIEL
No.

RAPHAEL
Think about it. He needs all the rebellious angels he can find. You know it adds up.

CASTIEL
Let's go.

RAPHAEL
Castiel, I'm warning you. Do not leave me here. I will find you.

CASTIEL
Maybe one day. But today, you're my little bitch.

CASTIEL leaves. DEAN follows, pausing.

DEAN
What he said.

BAR
INT. BAR – NIGHT

TIM holds up a test tube of red liquid. SAM stares at it.

SAM
What is that?

TIM
What do you think it is? It's go juice, Sammy boy.

SAM
Get that away from me.

TIM
Away from you? No. This is for you. Hell if that demon wasn't right as rain. Down the hatch, son.

SAM
You're insane.

TIM
Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna drink this, Hulk out, and you're gonna waste every one of the demon scum that killed my best friend.

TIM nods at LINDSEY, whom REGGIE has just handcuffed to the bar.

TIM
Or she dies.

SAM
You wouldn't do that.

TIM
It's funny how watching your best friend die changes that.

REGGIE and TIM advance on SAM, who retreats.

TIM
Come on, you know you want it, Sam. Just reach out and take it.

REGGIE charges SAM, who tosses him into the pool table. TIM joins in, he and REGGIE restraining SAM and pouring the demon blood into his mouth, then holding his mouth closed so he'll swallow. They drop SAM and back away. SAM gets up.

TIM
There, was that really so bad?

SAM spits it in TIM's eye and pounds him and REGGIE both, then grabs TIM, slams him into the bar, takes REGGIE's knife, and holds it to TIM's throat. He notices LINDSEY watching, scared, and throws TIM over to REGGIE.

SAM
Go.

TIM
Don't think we won't be back.

SAM
Don't think I won't be here.

ACT FIVE
IMPALA
INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN drives. CASTIEL rides shotgun.

DEAN
You okay?

CASTIEL is silent.

DEAN
Look, I'll be the first to tell you that this little crusade of yours is nuts, but I do know a little something about missing fathers.

CASTIEL
What do you mean?

DEAN
I mean there were times when I was looking for my dad when all logic said that he was dead, but I knew in my heart he was still alive. Who cares what some ninja turtle says, Cas, what do you believe?

CASTIEL
I believe he's out there.

DEAN
Good. Then go find him.

CASTIEL
What about you?

DEAN
What about me? I don't know. Honestly, I'm good. I can't believe I'm saying that, but I am, I'm really good.

CASTIEL
Even without your brother?

DEAN
Especially without my brother. I mean, I spent so much time worrying about the son of a bitch. I mean, I've had more fun with you in the past twenty-four hours than I've had with Sam in years, and you're not that much fun. It's funny, you know, I've been so chained to my family, but now that I'm alone, hell, I'm happy.

DEAN looks over; the shotgun seat is empty. His smile falters.

SAM'S MOTEL ROOM
EXT. GREAT PLAINS MOTEL – NIGHT

INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

SAM sleeps alone.

JESS
Sam. Sam.

SAM wakes up and looks around. JESS is back. He kisses her on the neck; she rolls over to face him.

JESS
So. This is your life now? Think you can just live forever with your head buried in the sand?

JESS runs her thumb over SAM'S chin.

SAM
I love you, Jess.

SAM sits up in bed, turning away from JESS, who sits up too.

SAM
God knows how much I miss you, too. But you're wrong. People can change. There is reason for hope.

JESS
No, Sam. There isn't.

JESS puts a hand on SAM's shoulder and morphs into NICK from 5.01 Sympathy for the Devil; JESS has been LUCIFER all along.

SAM
How can you be so sure?

LUCIFER
Because you freed me.

SAM turns, sees LUCIFER where he expected JESS, and stands up and backs away.

LUCIFER
That's right. You know who I am.

SAM
Lucifer.

LUCIFER
You are a hard one to find, Sam. Harder than most humans. I don't suppose you'd tell me where you are?

SAM
What do you want with me?

LUCIFER
Thanks to you, I walk the earth. I want to give you a gift. I want to give you everything.

SAM
I don't want anything from you.

LUCIFER
I'm so sorry, Sam, I, I really am, but Nick here is just an improvisation. Plan B. He can barely contain me without spontaneously combusting.

SAM
What are you talking about?

LUCIFER stands and moves closer to SAM.

LUCIFER
Why do you think you were in that chapel? You're the one, Sam. You're my vessel. My true vessel.

SAM
No.

LUCIFER
Yes.

SAM
No. That'll never happen.

LUCIFER
I'm sorry, but it will. I will find you. And when I do, you will let me in. I'm sure of it.

SAM
You need my consent.

LUCIFER crosses his arms over his chest.

LUCIFER
Of course. I'm an angel.

SAM
I will kill myself before letting you in.

LUCIFER
I'll just bring you back.

LUCIFER sighs.

LUCIFER
Sam. My heart breaks for you. The weight on your shoulders, what you've done, what you still have to do. It is more than anyone could bear. If there was some other way...but there isn't. I will never lie to you. I will never trick you. But you will say yes to me.

SAM
You're wrong.

LUCIFER
I'm not. I think I know you better than you know yourself.

SAM
Why me?

LUCIFER
Because it had to be you, Sam. It always had to be you.

SAM looks up. LUCIFER is gone.
