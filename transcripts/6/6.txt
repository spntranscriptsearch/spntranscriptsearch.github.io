TEASER
INT. BIGGERSON'S RESTAURANT, CALUMET CITY, ILLINOIS

TELEVISION VOICE OVER
I'm Ashley Frank, and I will...

JANE PETERSON, a waitress, emerges from the kitchen and walks to the till in the restaurant, all the while speaking on her cellphone.

JANE
He said he'd call, but of course he never did. But -- I don't know. I just -- we had such a good time. I-I should call him, right? Do you think? I mean, should I call him? I don't know. Oh. Uh, Olivia, just hold on a sec. (turns away from the frowning FRONT MANAGER, but continues her phone conversation) I just need the truth. That's all. I really gotta go, 'kay? Call you later.

CUT TO: INT. BIGGERSON'S KITCHEN
JANE is picking up an order.

COOK
I pity you.

JANE
I'm sorry?

COOK
You're sad and pathetic, and I pity you -- only reason I'm giving you a head's up. Stay away from the clam chowder. I flavored it with my own... seasoning.

JANE looks shocked, goes to deliver the order.

FRONT MANAGER
Hey, Jane. You know that new girl, Misty? Way hotter than you.

JANE
Excuse me?

FRONT MANAGER
Basically, she's an eight, and you're a... a three.

JANE, disconsolate, continues her duties.

JANE, to an elderly patron
Can I get you anything else, ma'am?

ELDERLY PATRON
No, thank you. I ran over a homeless man once, and I never even stopped to see if he was alive.

JANE turns. Other people address her as she moves through the restaurant.

LITTL GIRL
I hate mommy. I want to burn her in her sleep.

WAITER
I don't know what it is, but you just give me the creeps. Like I get physically nauseous.

FEMALE VOICE
You're pathetic.

MALE VOICE
Loser.

MALE VOICE
Desperate.

JANE is in a back room, unlocking a drawer and pulling out a gun.

FEMALE VOICE
Stupid. Mousy.

MALE VOICE
You're a desperate, pathetic loser.

FEMALE VOICE
You're gonna die alone.

JANE is in a corridor outside the main dining room, speaking on her cellphone to her sister, OLIVIA.

JANE
Hey, can you come get me?

OLIVIA
You sound awful. Have you been drinking?

JANE
I think I'm going crazy. I'm freaking out.

OLIVIA
Of course you are. 'Cause you are a freak. You're certifiable. Every time the phone rings, my stomach drops. Jane with another crisis. You're a walking disaster. (JANE pulls the gun out of her apron.) The whole family's just waiting for your next big breakdown, Jane. We're like hostages. Why don't you just go ahead and kill yourself already?

JANE places the gun under her chin. The camera moves up. A shot rings out and JANE's blood splatters on a sign that reads: BIGGERSON'S: THE HAPPY PLACE.

ACT ONE
EXT. - DAY - HOT DOG VENDOR.

SAM is in the line up. DEAN is walking away, talking to BOBBY on the phone.

DEAN
I know what I saw, Bobby.

BOBBY (in his home)
We tested him. Salt, silver -- everything.

DEAN
He threw me to that vamp. I'm telling you, it's not my brother.

BOBBY
Well, then he's something we ain't ever seen before.

DEAN
Yeah, or it's freakin' Lucifer.

BOBBY
Did you call Cas?

DEAN
'Course I called Cas. He's not answering. Screw him. I can't wait anymore.

BOBBY
Look, I get it. You're rattled. You're right to be. But let's be professional --

DEAN
Professional? He watched me get turned!

BOBBY
What you saw... are you sure that's what you saw?

DEAN
Damn it, Bobby, yes. I know.

BOBBY
Well, "you know" ain't the same as proof. 'Cause we're talking about --

DEAN
-- we're talking about doing something about this, and fast. It's not just the vamp, okay? He has been different from the jump.

BOBBY
All right. I'm with you.

DEAN
Are you?

BOBBY
Yeah. I'll hit the books, hard. Just don't shoot him yet, all right? Watch him. We need facts. 'Cause if it ain't Sam... we don't know what it is. And if we're gonna put him down, we need to know how.

DEAN
I don't even want to ride in the same car with him, much less work a damn case.

BOBBY
Get in the car. He's your case.

SAM walks up to DEAN with a newspaper and lunch in hand.

DEAN
Hey. I was just, uh, I was leaving Lisa a message.

SAM
Still hasn't called you back, huh?

DEAN
No.

SAM (hands DEAN a foil-wrapped hot dog)
Sucks.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM, lookig at DEAN intensely
You okay?

DEAN, stilted
Yeah. I'm fine. How are you?

SAM
Me? Great. Here, look. Check this out. Think it might be something.

SAM hands DEAN a newspaper featuring the story about JANE PETERSON.

SAM
Four people, out of nowhere, all in the last couple of weeks. What do you say?

DEAN
Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

SAM
Let's go.

INT. - DAY - OLIVIA'S HOUSE.

DEAN and SAM are posing as FBI agents. DEAN explores the house while SAM questions OLIVIA.

OLIVIA
I don't understand. Why would federal investigators be interested in a suicide?

SAM
Well, um... it's a new, more caring administration.

OLIVIA
Well, I already told the cops. Jane was having a really bad day, so I-I did what any sister would do. (plays with hair; DEAN drops in) I... tried to cheer her up, you know? Told her to hang in there.

SAM
You know what a "tell" is?

OLIVIA
Excuse me?

SAM
It's a poker term... for when you're bluffing. Like what you just did with your hair.

OLIVIA
What are you trying to say?

SAM
You're lying.

DEAN is surprised at the force of SAM's inquiry.

OLIVIA
What?!

SAM
Tell us what you did to your sister.

DEAN is shocked.

OLIVIA looks to DEAN for reassurance.

OLIVIA, breaks down as SAM looks vindicated
Okay. You're right. I was lying. I wanted to tell her, "I love you. I'm here for you." Oh, but what came out was... "You're a burden. Just kill yourself." Who says that?! I-I-I just couldn't stop!

EXT. - DAY - OUTSIDE OLIVIA'S HOUSE

DEAN and SAM are walking back to the car.

SAM
See anything in the house?

DEAN
No hex bags, no sulfur, no EMF. You?

SAM
A tuba and an issue of Crochet Today. So, what, already kinda suicidal?

DEAN
Right, and then big sis's Taxicab Confession sends her over the edge. Question is, what made big sis open her big, fat mouth in the first place?

SAM
Yeah, that is the question.

SAM and DEAN get into the Impala.

INT. - DENTIST'S OFFICE
TELEVISION VOICE OVER
Are organic fruits and veggies worth the high cost?

PAUL, a dentist
Thanks. Uh, can you grab some gauze, please?

DENTAL HYGENIST
Mm-hmm.

PATIENT
Should've had you prescribe me a Valium.
PAUL
Just relax.

TELEVISION comes into view, volume is low.
What is the truth?
PAUL, preparing a needle for freezing
It'll be fine.

TELEVISION
I'm Ashley Frank.

PATIENT
I got to be honest, Paul -- I don't really want to be here.

PAUL
You and most people. But you know what? I don't take it personally. Okay, open up.

PAUL injects the needle into the PATIENT's mouth.

PAUL
You and Donna should come over for supper. How long has it been? (pulls the needle out) There. Worst part's over.

PATIENT
I'm not really into Donna anymore. She's old.

PAUL, surprised
Your wife looks great for her age.

PATIENT
Her saggy skin makes me want to hurl. I have urges, you know.

PAUL
Okay.

PATIENT
Remember that camping trip I missed 'cause I was sick? Well, I wasn't. I was just afraid to be around Melissa.

PAUL
My daughter Melissa?
PATIENT
But then... she spent the night for Jill's slumber party. Oh... it just seemed so easy, you know?

PAUL
What are you saying?

PATIENT
It's not so much I couldn't control myself. I just knew I wouldn't get caught. And I didn't get caught.

PAUL grabs PATIENT by the throat, forcing him to gasp for air. PAUL shoves a drill into the PATIENT's mouth. Blood spurts incesstantly. The DENTAL HYGIENIST enters and screams.

ACT TWO
EXT. - DAY - HOTEL ROOM

DEAN is on the phone. Camera cuts to interior as he speaks to BOBBY. BOBBY is shot from outside his window. Camera cuts to interior as he speaks to DEAN.

DEAN, on the phone
Hey. You got anything?

BOBBY
I've been up all night lookin'. Nothing fits.

DEAN
Awesome.

BOBBY
You got anything else to go on?

DEAN
Yeah, my skin crawls being in the same room with him. Why don't you look that up?

BOBBY
I'm working on it.

DEAN
I don't know how much longer I can do this, Bobby. You got to figure out what the hell he is and fast.

BOBBY
I'm trying. But, Dean, there's a worst-case scenario.

DEAN
What, Satan's my co-pilot? Yeah, I know.

BOBBY
Well, that'd be the other worst case.

DEAN
Well, then what?

BOBBY
Maybe it's just Sam.

DEAN
I gotta go.

BOBBY
Dean.

DEAN
You got a day, Bobby, and then I'm handling this.

DEAN hangs up, takes a pull from a beer. He stares at Lisa's number for a while, then calls her, lets it ring once and hangs up.

SAM, dressed as an FBI agent, enters.

SAM
There was another one.

DEAN
Yeah? What?

SAM
Dentist drilled a guy to death.

DEAN
You mean the... non-sexy kind of drilling, right?

SAM, eager
50 bucks says he's mixed up in all the crazy.

DEAN
You think?

SAM
Yeah. Let's go talk to him.

DEAN
Okay. Uh... why don't you go ahead? I'll catch up. I'm gonna do a little research.

SAM, disbelieving
You sure?

DEAN
Yeah. We got to know what we're up against, right?

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

SAM exits.

DEAN is relieved, but anxious.

EXT. - DAY - OUTSIDE A BUILDING

SAM has been questioning the DENTAL HYGIENIST.

SAM
Thanks a lot.

SAM walks away and calls DEAN.

DEAN
Anything from Marathon Man?

SAM
Not exactly. He hung himself in his cell before I could get to him.

DEAN
Yikes.

SAM
But he was definitely involved. Just got the scoop from his assistant.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
Yeah. Let's say the stuff that his patient was confessing to -- I'd have murdered him, too.

DEAN
So, root canal and Russian roulette -- both of 'em, it's like they were cursed, right? I mean, people are just compelled to puke the truth all over 'em?

SAM
Oh, getting hit with the ugly truth, you go postal? I'd call that a curse. Do me a favor -- I'm going to the morgue to check out the body. Why don't you take the dentist's office, see what you see?

DEAN
Yeah. No problem.

DEAN hangs up, closes his laptop, which was open on an article titled "Doppleganger".

INT. - DENTIST'S OFFICE

DEAN sneaks in under the police tape, past the bloodied dental chair, and into PAUL's office. There is a saxophone on the credenza. DEAN picks up a pack of reeds from PAUL's desk and a receipt from Harry's House of Horns. DEAN remembers seeing the shop's name on JANE PATTERSON's calendar, along with a note about a dental appointment.

INT. - DAY - HARRY'S HOUSE OF HORNS
HARRY is holding up photos of PAUL and JANE that DEAN supplied.

HARRY
Jane and Dr. Conley. I heard. Awful. What do I have to do with it?

DEAN
Honestly? You're the only thing they have in common. Did they say anything to you before they, uh...?

HARRY
Sorry. Not really.

DEAN
Right. Ah, I was just fishing. Thanks.

HARRY
Hey, by the way, how 'bout my horn?

DEAN
Sorry?

HARRY
Stolen horn?

DEAN
Right. Yeah. We're -- we're working on it.

DEAN turns to leave.

HARRY
Well, I hope so. Thing's one-in-a-billion.

DEAN turns back.

DEAN
What makes it one-in-a-billion again?

HARRY
It's a museum piece. And near as anyone can tell, about a thousand years old.

HARRY shows DEAN a photo of the instrument.

DEAN
Where's it from?

HARRY
No one knows.

DEAN
When did it get swiped?

HARRY
About... two weeks ago -- same day Jane died.

INT. - DAY - MOTEL

DEAN has an entry about Gabriel's Horn of Truth up on his laptop.

DEAN drains a glass of whiskey.
Castiel? Hello? Possible loose nuke down here, angelic weapon. Kinda your department. You hear that, Cas?

CASTIEL appears.
Hello, Dean.

DEAN
Are you kidding me? I have been on red alert about Sam, and you come for some stupid horn?!

CASTIEL
You asked me to be here, and I came.

DEAN
I -- I've been asking you to be here for days, you dick!

CASTIEL, abashed.
I didn't come about Sam because I have nothing to offer about Sam.

DEAN
Well, that's great, because for all we know, he's just gift wrap for Lucifer.

CASTIEL
No, he's... he's not Lucifer.

CASTIEL grabs the bottle of whiskey.

DEAN
And how do you know that?

CASTIEL refills DEAN's glass.

CASTIEL
If Lucifer escaped the cage, we'd feel it.

DEAN
What is wrong with him?

CASTIEL
I don't know, Dean. I'm sorry.

DEAN
What happened to you, Cas? You used to be human, or at least like one.

CASTIEL
I'm at war. Certain... regrettable things are now required of me.

DEAN
And Gabriel's Horn of Truth? That's a real thing?

CASTIEL
You've seen it?

DEAN
We think it's in town. Something's forcing people...

Sound of angel wings fluttering. CASTIEL has left.

DEAN
Oh, well, you're welcome!

DEAN takes a swig. CASTIEL reappears behind him.

CASTIEL
It isn't the Horn of Truth.

DEAN
What are you talking about? You were gone for like two seconds. Where did you look?

CASTIEL
Everywhere.

DEAN
Right. Well, nice seeing you, anyway.

CASTIEL
Dean.

DEAN
What?

CASTIEL
About your brother. I... I don't know what's wrong with him, but I do want to help. I'll make inquiries.

CASTIEL disappears again.

DEAN
Yeah. Thanks.

DEAN takes another drink.

INT. - MORGUE

PAUL's body is being pulled out.

SAM
Now, I'd actually like to see all the suicides that came in this week, not just Dr. Giggles. Is that gonna be a problem?

CORONER

Well, they're -- they're already gone.

SAM
As in transferred?

CORONER
Yeah, not exactly.

SAM
Would you like to tell me what's going on here, or should I have a little chat with your supervisor?

CORONER, confidentially.
They're gone.

SAM
As in... gone gone?

CORONER nods.

EXT. - STREETVIEW OF A BAR CAFE.

INT. - OF BAR CAFE.

The televison is on.

ASHLEY FRANK
...Consumers from predatory prices. Here's the facts.

ANNOUNCER
Tune in weekdays for the newest addition to our award-winning local team.

DEAN is sitting at the bar, drinking a shot.

ASHLEY FRANK
Find out the truth about your layaway living room.

BARTENDER
Another one?

DEAN
Uh, no, thanks. I'm working.

BARTENDER looks at DEAN askance. DEAN's phone rings.

DEAN
Hey, what's up?

SAM, walking into an apartment building called Carlton Court.
All the bodies are gone.

DEAN
What do you mean, they just vanished?

SAM
That's what the coroner said. But I got a lead. One of the missing bodies, she died a whole week before everybody else.

DEAN
Suicide?

SAM
Reported as a car accident, but no reason it couldn't have been.

DEAN
So then that would make her our patient zero, right?

SAM
I'm thinking maybe. Whatever got this whole curse thing rolling started with her. I'm at her place now, corner of Burnham and 159th.

DEAN
Yeah, give me 10.

DEAN to BARTENDER:
You know what? I will have that other one.

BARTENDER:
Thought you were working.

DEAN, rubbing his eyes.
I am working up to it.

BARTENDER
You okay?

DEAN
No, not really.

ASHLEY FRANK
I talked to local experts to bring you the truth.

BARTENDER, pouring DEAN a shot.
On me. Anything else I can get you?

DEAN
I'd just like the freakin' truth.

DEAN drains the shot.

DEAN
But I'll settle for another one.

BARTENDER

Sometimes I think I can't get pregnant 'cause God knows my marriage is a sham. Why'd I say that? I mean, I've been snorting oxy all day. Why'd I say that?

DEAN
I'm pretty sure I know.

ACT THREE
INT. - BAR CAFE

TELEVISION is still on.

ASHLEY FRANK
I'm Ashley Frank with Frank Talk...

DEAN
I've got to go. Thank you.

DEAN walks by a BUSTY PATRON.

BUSTY PATRON
I'm sitting like this so you'll look at my breasts. I just bought them. I need a lot of attention.

DEAN
Good luck with that.

DEAN leaves, then walks back for another peek.

EXT. - BAR CAFE

DEAN is walking back to the Impala. DEAN calls BOBBY.

DEAN
Hey, anything you're itchin' to tell me?

BOBBY, in his kitchen, grabbing a beer.
Not really. Sorry to disappoint.

DEAN
Ah, that's all right. I'm just testing a theory.

BOBBY
Well, I'm here hittin' the books while drinking a nice glass of milk, while watching "Tori & Dean."

DEAN
Wh-- wait, w-who and Dean?

BOBBY
Tori Spelling. I'm a huge fan. Girl's a real talent.

DEAN, to himself.
Oh, I guess it does work over the phone.

BOBBY
You know what else? I get a pedicure once in a while -- this nice Vietnamese joint.

BOBBY takes off his boots.

DEAN
Okay. Okay, please stop.

BOBBY
This one gal, Nhung Phuong -- her name means "velvet Phoenix." Tiny thing, but the grip on her. She starts on my toes, and I feel like I am gonna --

DEAN
Whoa, whoa! Hey, come on, ma-- now I'm scarred for life. Thank you.

BOBBY
I never told anyone that. Why am I telling you? Maybe 'cause you're my favorite. Although, Sam's a better hunter. Lately, anyway.

DEAN
Whoa. Why the hell am I tellin' you this?!

DEAN
Because I'm cursed.

BOBBY
Cursed?

DEAN
Yes.

BOBBY
How is it... that half the time you clean a mess, you end up dirty?

DEAN
Actually, this might be the best thing that's happened to me in a while.

BOBBY
What do you mean? Dean... Dean, what damn fool move are you about to --

DEAN
I gotta go.

BOBBY
Okay.But did you know my first girlfriend turned out to be a --

DEAN, hanging up emphatically.
No, no! Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

DEAN gets into the Impala, calls Sam, gets his voice mail.

SAM
It's Sam. Leave me a message.

DEAN
Sam, it's me. Listen, I'm on my way to you, but if you get this before then, give me a call back. There's a few things I want to ask you.

INT. - CARLTON COURT APARTMENT

ROOMMATE
So, why is there an investigation for a car accident?

SAM
It wasn't an accident. Corey committed suicide.

ROOMMATE, breaking down.
You know... I wondered. I-I'm sorry. I just...

SAM hands her a box of tissues.

SAM
So, you had some idea Corey might have taken her own life?

ROOMMATE
Well... she had been going through a bit of a hard time lately... at school. And then, um, her cat, Mittens, had just ran away. But, really, it was her boyfriend. She was sure that he was cheating on her. But he was just very good at covering his tracks. Which, of course, made her completely obsessed with --

SAM
-- finding out the truth.

ROOMMATE
Yeah.

SAM
You mind if I check out her room?

EXT. - CARLTON COURT

DEAN pulls up in the Impala. His phone rings.

DEAN
Hey.

LISA, in her bedroom.
So... I saw you called.

DEAN
Yeah, it's been crazy.

LISA
Ben won't even talk about it.

DEAN
Lisa, I'm sorry, but this is actually the... worst time in the universe to talk. C-can we do this later?

LISA
You shoved my kid, Dean. How about we do this now?

DEAN
It wasn't like that.

LISA
Then how was it?

DEAN
I can't really explain.

LISA
You want to know the truth?

DEAN
Probably not.

LISA

You've got so much buried in there, and you push it down, and you push it down. Do you honestly think that you can go through life like that and not freak out? Just, what, drink half a fifth a night and you're good?

DEAN
You knew what you signed up for.

LISA
Yeah. But I didn't expect Sam to come back. And I'm glad he's okay. I am. But the minute he walked through that door, I knew. It was over. You two have the most unhealthy, tangled-up, crazy thing I've ever seen. And as long as he's in your life, you're never gonna be happy. That came out so much harsher than I meant.

DEAN
It's not your fault.

LISA
I'm not saying don't be close to Sam. I'm close to my sister. But if she got killed, I wouldn't bring her back from the dead!

DEAN
Okay, Lis... I'm not gonna lie. Okay, me and Sam, we... we've got issues. No doubt. But you and Ben --

LISA
Me and Ben can't be in this with you. I'm sorry.

LISA hangs up, leaving DEAN despondent.

INT. - COREY'S BEDROOM

SAM is searching the room. He finds a box under the bed. He opens the box and takes out a cat's skull.

SAM
Sorry, Mittens.

INT. - STAIRCASE

DEAN is walking up, SAM is walking down.

SAM
Hey, where you been? I found something.

DEAN
It can wait. We got to talk.

SAM
Yeah. What's up?

SAM and DEAN walk back downstairs.

DEAN
There's a few things I want to ask you, and, uh, you're gonna tell me the truth.

SAM
Uh, yeah, Dean. Of course. What are you talking about? Whoa. Are you saying you're...

DEAN
I asked for the truth. And you know what? I'm getting it. So, like I said, I have a few questions for you. When that vamp attacked me, why did you just stand there?

SAM falters, turns on puppy dog eyes.
I-I didn't. I froze.

DEAN
You froze. You have been Terminator since you got back.

SAM
I don't know. Shock? And then it was too late. I feel terrible about it. Believe me. Dean... I can't lie here. Do you really think I would let something like that happen on purpose? You're my brother. H-how could you even --

DEAN
Okay. Okay. Sorry. I...I thought -- I thought I saw something. I... I guess I was wrong. It's just been a really, really bad day.

SAM
Hey. It's okay. I got your back, all right? I always have.

DEAN
Thanks, Sammy.

SAM turns. His expression goes blank as he walks down the stairs.

ACT FOUR
INT. - HOTEL ROOM

DEAN, holding Corey's cat skull, walking to join SAM at the kitchen table.
So this was the chick's pet?

SAM, working on his laptop.
Well, she was obsessed.

DEAN
I think you mean crazy.

SAM, taking the cat skull.
All right, so cat skull, uh, grains-of-paradise seed, devil's shoestring. Mix 'em well, you got yourself a summoning spell.

DEAN
Demon?

SAM, showing DEAN a webpage about VERITAS, Goddess of Truth.
God. Corey was so desperate for the truth about her boyfriend's cheating heart, she went digging around. Nothing panned out, so she went looking for a different kind of help.

DEAN
Opened a door she couldn't close.

SAM
Yeah. Now anyone in town who asks aloud for the truth invokes Veritas. And she doesn't just give it to you. She slams you with it until you kill yourself and she gets her tribute.

DEAN
So, all that "tribute" vanishing from the morgue. What do you think, uh, Soylent Green situation?

SAM
Gods got to eat, too. Which means we got to take her out or you're on the menu.

DEAN
All right, well, what do we know, besides crazy cat lady?

SAM
Well, dogs are her Achilles heel.

DEAN
Naturally.

SAM
And she was a pretty hands-on goddess back in the day. Her thing was coming down from the mountain to speak truth to the masses. She wanted more than tribute. She wanted to be worshipped.

DEAN
An attention whore.

SAM
If you want to put it that way.

DEAN
And what is the 21st-century version of speaking truth to the masses?

EXT. - NIGHT - TELEVISION STUDIO

A large, backlit poster outside the doors advertises the show, "Frank Talk", with ASHLEY FRANK. SAM and DEAN exit from behind the poster. SAM is carrying a desktop computer tower.

SAM
So you really think this God is slumming as some farm-league Diane Sawyer?

DEAN
Eh, call it a hunch.

DEAN pays off a door man. SAM puts the computer in the trunk of the Impala. SAM and DEAN get in the car.

INT. - NIGHT - MOTEL ROOM
SAM and DEAN are sitting on the edges of their respective bed. The television studio's computer is running through SAM's laptop, which is perched on a chair between them. SAM starts the recording, which is raw footage of "Frank Talk".
ASHLEY FRANK
I'm Ashley -- (coughs) I'm Ashley Frank, bringing you "Frank Talk." Let's do that again.

OFF-CAMERA PRODUCER
Okay, still rolling.

ASHLEY FRANK
I'm Ashley Frank,bringing you "Frank Talk." Again. I'm Ashley Frank. Are organic fruits and veggies really worth the cost?

DEAN, sitting back on his bed, drinking coffee and eating a donut.
She's creepy. I mean, the hair alone. I don't know, man. Maybe there's nothing here.

SAM, increasing the speed on the video.
Maybe.
Time elapses. Sunlight comes in through the window. DEAN's bed shows evidence of having been slept in. DEAN is wearing a different shirt and has moved to the table, eating a pizza. SAM is still staring intensely at the video; he does not appear to have moved in hours, except to remove his over-shirt.

ASHLEY FRANK, at increased speed
Are we -- we're spinning? Do the new rent-to-own prices...
...A recent trend in furniture stores...
...But think twice before you decide to buy --
Before you make that big purchase...
...Okay.
...We'll ask the councilman ourselves.
During the last statement, ASHLEY FRANK is shown standing outside a house. In the background, a large dog starts barking at her.

ASHLEY FRANK, nervous
Are we still rolling?

SAM
Hold on. Check this out.

DEAN comes over, sits back on the bed.
Zoom in on that.

SAM complies. Magnified, ASHLEY FRANK's eyes have a non-human glow.

EXT. - NIGHT - OUTSIDE THE TELEVISION STUDIO

ASHLEY FRANK drives away in a red convertible. SAM and DEAN follow in the Impala. ASHLEY drives up to an enormous, modernist house. DEAN parks the Impala nearby.

SAM
Looks pretty normal, right?

DEAN
I'm sure inside it's chock full of creep.

The house's interior lights up as ASHLEY enters.

DEAN, holding up two large knives.
Ready?

SAM, holding up a jar of liquid.
Yeah.

DEAN
And that's...?

SAM
Dog's blood.

DEAN
Do I even want to know where you got that?

SAM
Probably not.

DEAN
Ugh.

ASHLEY is seen ascending her staircase. SAM dips the knives in the dog's blood.

DEAN
All right, let's do this.

DEAN and SAM exit the Impala. Camera cuts to a view of the convertible parked in front of the house, then to a minimalist but expensive-looking dining and living room, into which DEAN and SAM enter.

SAM
So where's all the creep?

DEAN and SAM follow a cat downstairs. They stop at a mosaic of VERITAS, which looks exactly like the one depicted on the website SAM was researching. They follow the cat into another room. The cat is seen on a gurney, lapping at a bloody, mutilated human corpse. A gutted, bleeding, torso hangs in the middle of the room. The body of the dentist lies on another gurney.

VERITAS
You came for dinner.

SAM and DEAN turn to see ASHLEY FRANK, now dressed in a goddess' raiment. As VERITAS, she waves her hand, sending SAM and DEAN hurtling into the hanging torso. They fall to the floor of the large basin for catching blood, and lay unconscious.

Sometime later, the boys are seen sitting up in the basin. DEAN is unconscious. SAM wakes up to find his hands tied behind his back, to a post. He sees VERITAS put the dog's blood-soaked knives into a drawer. DEAN wakes up and is startled by the bloody torso hanging over him and SAM.

VERITAS
Mm. Sit tight. (points to the mutilated corpse) You're up next.

DEAN is shocked. SAM covertly slips out a switchblade from his sleeve.

VERITAS opens the dentist's mouth and reaches in with pinchers.

SAM opens his knife, communicates a look to DEAN.
VERITAS, pulling the dentist's tongue out of his mouth.
The tongue... is the tastiest part. It's where the lies roll off.

VERITAS takes a bite out of the tongue.
DEAN, sickened, closes his eyes.

VERITAS Mmm. Mmm! I cannot wait to eat yours. I mean, I've seen liars before, but you two? Gold standard.

VERITAS puts down the tongue, walks away.

SAM works his knife into the rope.

DEAN
Point of professional pride.

VERITAS, standing in front of DEAN.
I wouldn't be so cocky if I were you, Dean. You know what happens when you base your life on lies, right? The truth comes along and... So, while you've still got your tongue, God knows you've got an earful.

SAM's knife cuts into the rope.

VERITAS, sitting next to Dean.
I think it's your turn to spill some. How 'bout we play a little truth or truth? What should we ask Dean first, hmm? Something... Personal about you? (looks at SAM) Hey, Dean, I'm curious. What do you really feel about your brother?

DEAN, hesitant at first.
Better now. As of yesterday, I wanted to kill him in his sleep.

SAM is surprised.

DEAN
I thought he was a monster. But now I think...

VERITAS
Now you think what?

DEAN
He's just acting like me.

VERITAS
What do you mean?

DEAN
It's the gig.

SAM's knife is almost through the rope.

DEAN
You're covered in blood until you're covered in your own blood. Half the time, you're about to die. Like right now. I told myself I wanted out... that I wanted a family.

VERITAS
But you were lying.

DEAN
No. But what I'm good at... is slicing throats. I ain't a father. I'm a killer. And there's no changing that. I know that now.

VERITAS pats DEAN on the shoulder, gets up and walks toward SAM.

VERITAS
So, Sam walking back into your life must have been a relief. Hmm? Mallory to your Mickey. And how do you feel about the band getting back together? Hmm, Sam?

VERITAS is now sitting next to SAM.

SAM
Look... what we do... is hard.

DEAN casts about and sees a hook.

SAM
But...we watch out for each other.

DEAN meets SAM's eyes, communicating a plan.

SAM
And that's what's important. And that's it. That's the truth.

VERITAS, confused.
No. No, it's not.

SAM
You said yourself -- I can't lie.

VERITAS
How are you doing that? That's not possible. You're lying to me!

SAM
No, I'm not!

VERITAS
What are you? (addressing DEAN) What is he?

SAM
I don't know what you're talking about.

VERITAS
Really? I doubt that. I doubt anything that comes out of your mouth right now. You're not human.

DEAN
What?

VERITAS
You didn't know that? Now, that I believe.

SAM cuts through the rope, tosses the knife to DEAN, grabs one of the dog's blood-soaked knives and rushes VERITAS. VERITAS knocks him back with a series of punches. SAM falls back onto the floor, dropping the knife. VERITAS begins to choke him. DEAN cuts through his rope, grabs the hook and impales VERITAS through the back. She turns around. Her human face is replaced with a monstrous one. While she is thus distracted, SAM plunges the dog's blood-soaked knife into her heart. Her body lies half in the basin.

SAM stands up. DEAN brandishes the other dog's blood-soaked knife at him.

ACT FIVE
INT. - VERITAS' KILLING FLOOR

DEAN is threatening SAM with the dog's blood-soaked knife.

SAM
Dean, it's me.

DEAN, backing SAM around the basin.
You are not my brother.

SAM
Just listen.

DEAN
What are you?!

SAM
I'm me, Dean. Look, please, just let me explain.

DEAN
Why the hell should I believe anything you say?

SAM
Okay, okay. You want the truth? Here it is. Here it is. God's honest. She was right. There's something wrong with me, really wrong. I've known it for a while. I lied to you. Yeah. And...I let you get turned by that vamp. Because I knew there was a cure, Dean, and we needed in that nest! And I knew you could handle it!

DEAN
Handle it?! I could've died! I could've killed Ben.

SAM
And that should stop me cold. But I -- I just don't feel it.

DEAN
You what?

SAM
Ever since I came back, I am a-a better hunter than I've ever been! Nothing scares me anymore! 'Cause I can't feel it. I don't know what's wrong with me. I think... I need help.

SAM looks solicitous. DEAN is emotional. He turns away, then turns back. SAM looks hopeful. DEAN hesitates, then punches SAM. SAM falls back. DEAN sets upon him, punching SAM repeatedly and viciously, stopping after SAM is unconscious and bloody.
