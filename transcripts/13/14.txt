TEASER

INTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD – NIGHT

[JACK sleeping. He can hear SAM and DEAN’s voices echoing from somewhere. He opens his eyes and sits up on the bed as he continues to hear their voices.]

DEAN

Tough kid.

SAM

Yeah, I really thought that was it for us.

DEAN

Yeah. Well, killin’ vamps makes me hungry. Ah, home sweet home.

SAM

Feels good to be back.

DEAN

Yeah, you’re telling me.

SAM

The last few weeks have been a nightmare.

DEAN

You know what? We made it, though. You, me and the kid. Finally under one roof.

SAM

And you know what, honestly, it doesn’t matter where he’s been. I’m just glad Jack’s back.

DEAN

Right, home safe. Where he belongs.

[JACK smiles as he hears this. However, an alarm sounds off. JACK is now standing in his room at the bunker. He sees smoke coming from under the door, and runs out. He hears SAM and DEAN yelling down the hallway.]

SAM

Jack!

JACK

Sam? Dean?

SAM

Hurry!

JACK

Hold on!

[Jack runs down the hallway.]

DEAN

Jack! Help!

[Jack gets to DEAN’s door, which is shut.]

DEAN

In here! Help! The door, man! You gotta open the door!

JACK

It’s locked!

SAM

It’s a fire! We’re trapped!

JACK

What’s happening?!

[SAM and DEAN continue to yell. JACK eyes start to glow and tries to use his power to open the door.]

DEAN

That’s it! That’s it! You’re doing it! Jack!

[JACK’s power stops and throws him back against the wall. He falls to the floor. SAM and DEAN are continuing to call out to him as they are coughing.]

SAM

Jack? Jack, please! Open the door!

DEAN

Jack, open the door!

JACK

I can’t!


SAM

Jack, you gotta help us! Jack, please help!

DEAN

JACK!

[The bunker is gone. JACK is standing in a room in the Apocalypse World, his eyes vacant as he looks into the distance. MICHAEL appears behind him. ZACHARIAH is holding his fingers to JACK’s head.]

MICHAEL

Zachariah, these mind games of yours aren’t working.

ZACHARIAH

We’re close. Okay, I’ll… I’ll keep trying.

MICHAEL

And you’re sure this… half-breed is our ticket to the other side?

ZACHARIAH

Yes. And not just a single one-way ticket like the prophet’s spell. This boy, he can open a rift big enough to march an army through. He has so much power. We just… have to make him use it.

MICHAEL

Then make him.

ZACHARIAH

Yes, Commander.

[MICHAEL nods as they both look back at JACK who is still in a trance.]

If fear won’t break him, I think I know something that will.

[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER – DAY

[DONATELLO is sitting at a desk, scribbling notes down. The demon tablet, a lot of other papers and a bucket of chicken wings are scattered on the table. He whispers to himself, and is hearing Enochian words in his mind as he writes them down on the page. There is a knock at the door.]

CASTIEL

Donatello?

DONATELLO

Come in!

[CASTIEL walks in holding a plate of food. He takes in the mess at the table.]

CASTIEL

Um… Sam and Dean thought you might want some breakfast.

DONATELLO

Oh, yeah. Thank you.

CASTIEL

Are you okay?

DONATELLO

Fine, fine. Uh… just… the tablet, it… it has a raw energy. There’s a power here I’ve never seen. Tell the boys thank you for me, and uh, I’m making progress.

[CASTIEL nods and leaves the room. DONATELLO continues to write.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, KITCHEN – DAY

[DEAN is sitting at the table, a big plate of bacon and his coffee in front of him. SAM is standing behind him pouring coffee.]

SAM

Don’t you think you should, uh, take it a little easy on the nitrates?

DEAN

Dude, if bacon’s what kills me, then I win.

[CASTIEL stands in the doorway.]

SAM

Cas, hey. How’s Donatello?

CASTIEL

He says he’s making progress, but we still need archangel grace, we should be out looking for Lucifer.

SAM

We are.

DEAN

Look, we got word out to every hunter we know, okay? If they see something Satan-y… they’ll drop a dime.

CASTIEL

And Michael? If he succeeds in getting to our world first?

SAM

Cas, look. Right now, our best defence is a good offence.

DEAN

We’ll give Donatello everything he needs to open that gate, then we stealth in, we get mom, we get Jack, boom. Family reunion. It’s just gonna take some time.

EXTERIOR – LAKESIDE – DAY

[JACK is looking around at the landscape, as CASTIEL appears behind him.]

CASTIEL

Beautiful, isn’t it?

JACK

Castiel.

CASTIEL

I wanted you to see the natural world before… before it was spoiled. Humans have good intentions, but… they never truly appreciated the gift they were given. Left to their own devices, humans… they would destroy everything.

JACK

Why?

CASTIEL

You’ve been so sheltered. Let me show you.

[CASTIEL holds his fingers against JACK’s temples. JACK sees images of ice caps breaking, oil spills, people fighting, explosions.]

CASTIEL

Humans. They take, and they take. And they just can’t help themselves.

[CASTIEL removes his hands.]

So, you… you have to help them. Jack, you have the power to save us all. And I can guide you. I can teach you some miraculous things.

JACK

What about Sam and Dean?

CASTIEL

Well, if only they’d accepted you, instead of teaching you to fear your powers.

JACK

My powers…

CASTIEL

Because they feared them. Now, if you’ll just do as I say—

JACK

No, that’s not true. I remember. I was with Sam and Dean the last time I used my powers. We got separated and… I was in the other world.

[JACK looks at CASTIEL.]

You’re not Castiel. None of this is real.

[CASTIEL smiles evilly. JACK wakes up in the Apocalypse World.]

INTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, CHURCH – DAY

[MICHAEL and ZACHARIAH are standing in front of JACK.]

MICHAEL

Well, so much for killing him with kindness.

JACK

You. Michael?

[MICHAEL throws JACK against a wall.]

ZACHARIAH

My Lord—

[MICHAEL throws ZACHARIAH back.]

MICHAEL

We tried it your way.

[MICHAEL walks over and grabs JACK by his shirt.]
Now… we do it mine.


INTERIOR – THE BUNKER – DAY

[DONATELLO continues to write his notes as he hears the Enochian words.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, HALLWAY – DAY

[DONATELLO runs down the hallway.]

DONATELLO

Eureka! Eureka! Eureka! Eureka! Eureka! Eureka!

[DONATELLO runs into the bunker’s library where SAM and DEAN are. He slaps his papers down on the table.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, LIBRARY – DAY

DEAN

You stroking out?

DONATELLO

No, I-I cracked it!

CASTIEL

What?

DONATELLO

T-The spell. I-I finished the translation.

SAM

What? No way.

DONATELLO

[out of breath] Here’s the ingredients. Whew! Running is hard.

DEAN

Okay, what are we looking at?

CASTIEL

Besides archangel grace.

[SAM looks at the ingredients.]



SAM

Actually, that’s not even in here. Maybe the spell on the Angel tablet’s different because this, oil of Abramelin, Angelica root, we-we have most of this stuff. Oh. Other than the—the hearts of Gog and Magog?

DEAN

Sorry. What?

DONATELLO

Um, they’re—they’re people. Kind of. Uh, sometimes referred to as brothers, other times lands. Uh… you know how Bibles are. Too damn many translations.

CASTIEL

Wait, Gog and—and Magog… I’d—I’d heard rumors, but I didn’t think they were human.

DONATELLO

Oh, yes. According to the tablet, they were ancient warriors who enslaved half the Fertile Crescent, until some priests cast a spell to bind them away in “a place without a place and a time without a time.”

DEAN

Okay, so we’re supposed to find these guys and cut out their hearts? How?

DONATELLO

The—the demon tablet has very specific instructions on how to free them. These men are very dangerous.

CASTIEL

Then I’ll do it.

DEAN

I’ll go with you.

DONATELLO

Excellent! And Sam and I will stay behind to, uh, uh, assemble the other ingredients. Now, um… where do you keep your virgin lamb’s blood?

INTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD – DAY

[JACK is being dragged down a hallway by MICHAEL. He opens a cell and throws JACK in. JACK struggles to sit up, and sees MARY sitting in the corner.]

JACK

Mary?

ACT TWO

INTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, JAIL CELL – DAY

MARY

I’ve seen you before.

JACK

Your sons, Sam and Dean. They sent me.

MARY

Are they here?

JACK

No.

MARY

[sighs.] Thank God.

JACK

My name is Jack.

MARY

Jack? Your mother… wasn’t Kelly Kline?

JACK

You knew my mother?

MARY

I was there when you were born. And she, uh…

JACK

Died. I know.

MARY

You should be six months old.

JACK

I am. Sort of.

MARY

Jack, how did you get here?

JACK

I opened a door.

MARY

To another world? You can do that?

JACK

I—Sam and Dean—we were coming to save you, but something went wrong, and now it’s just me. And Michael, I… I tried to fight him, but he was in my head. He wants me to use my powers, but I don’t know why.

MARY

I do. You said he was in your head? Well, he’s in my head, too. And I saw everything. He’s gonna bring an army to our world and just…

JACK

He wants me to open the door. But I won’t. He can’t make me. I—I don’t care how much he hurts me.

MARY

[sighs] He’s not gonna hurt you, Jack. He’s gonna hurt me. Why do you think he brought you here? So that we would meet, so that we would talk. And then when he comes back, if you don’t do what he wants, he’s going to kill me.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER – DAY

[DEAN is looking down from the balcony near the entrance, as CASTIEL walks up the stairs.]

DEAN

You ready?

CASTIEL

Yeah.

DEAN

How are you holdin’ up, Cas?

CASTIEL

I’m fine.

DEAN

No, I just mean with, you know, everything you’ve been through. And… I know you really wanna find Lucifer.

CASTIEL

No, it’s not that. It’s about… well, it is that, but it’s also I… Dean I was—I was dead.

DEAN

Temporarily.

CASTIEL

And I have to believe I was brought back for a reason.

DEAN

You were. Okay, Jack brought you back because we needed you back.

CASTIEL

Right. And how have I repaid him? I promised his mother that I would protect him, but now he’s trapped in that place while Lucifer is here, who’s… I mean, he’s getting stronger and more powerful by the day. And if Michael really is coming, maybe I was brought back to help prepare.

DEAN

Prepare for what?

CASTIEL

War. War is what Michael does.

DEAN

Well, then we do what we do. Whatever it takes.

[DEAN pats CASTIEL on the shoulder and leaves the bunker. CASTIEL follows.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, LIBRARY – DAY

[SAM walks in with a box of bottles and sets them down. DONATELLO is standing at the table with the other ingredients for the spell.]

SAM

Okay, how are we looking?

DONATELLO

We still need the Dead Sea brine and the, uh, wolfsbane.

SAM

On it.

[SAM leaves, as DONATELLO looks suspicious.]

EXTERIOR – FIELD – DAY

[DEAN looks around at the field before turning to CASTIEL.]

DEAN

Alright, field in the middle of nowhere. Check. What’s next?

CASTIEL

Well, Donatello said that Gog and Magog can only be killed by a weapon touched by God, so angel blade.

[CASTIEL passes an angel blade to DEAN.]

DEAN

Alright. Let’s rock and roll.

CASTIEL

[starts Enochian spell] Zoh nuh ray nuh rah juh. Kohrahx oh. Ee zee zohp ah. Mah oh. Ee vee gee.

[DEAN and CASTIEL look around the field as nothing has happened.]

DEAN

Well, Enochian’s kinda tough. Maybe you got a word wrong.

CASTIEL.

I don’t get “words wrong.”’

[GOG and MAGOG appear from behind them. DEAN and CASTIEL turn around.]

I told you.

[DEAN laughs at GOG and MAGOG who are dressed in armour and loincloths.]

CASTIEL

This is serious.

DEAN

[stifles laugh] Yeah, no, no, I-I-I know. But… they’re wearing—they’re wearing loincloths.

CASTIEL

Dean.

GOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] Well met, fellows!

MAGOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] But where are their armies?

CASTIEL

It’s ancient – ancient Canaanite. They wanna know if we brought armies.

DEAN

Armies?

CASTIEL

To fight them.

GOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] Whichever warrior releases us must face us in combat! He—

MAGOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] Or she—

GOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] Why interrupt me? You always do this.

MAGOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] Do what?

GOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] Contradict me!

[DEAN and CASTIEL look on in confusion.]

DEAN

W—what now?

CASTIEL

Uh, they’re… arguing.

DEAN

Ah. [jokingly] Ask ‘em where they got their loincloths.

CASTIEL

Dean.

MAGOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] … as soon as we kill these fellows!

GOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] Good! Good! Which shall we kill first?

[They turn to look between DEAN and CASTIEL.]

MAGOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] I will kill the pretty one.

DEAN

It’s a furry diaper.

CASTIEL

Dean.

GOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] They are equally pretty.

MAGOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] The smaller one, then—

GOG

Eh.

MAGOG

[speaking ancient Canaanite] Enough! You! Embrace your beautiful death!

[MAGOG takes out his sword and walks toward DEAN.]

CASTIEL

Uh, he just said that he’s gonna—he’s gonna—

DEAN

No, I got it.

[MAGOG swings his sword at DEAN as GOG starts fighting CASTIEL. DEAN lifts up the angel blade, but MAGOG shatters it with his sword.]

DEAN

Cas! What the hell?!

[CASTIEL is blocking GOG from stabbing him, as GOG yells at him.]

CASTIEL

He said their blades were forged by a god!

[MAGOG kicks DEAN to the ground. DEAN gets up.]

DEAN

Cool.

[DEAN continues to fight MAGOG as CASTIEL fights GOG. MAGOG throws DEAN to the ground again. MAGOG tries to step on DEAN but he moves out of the way and stands back up. MAGOG lunges at DEAN, DEAN moves out of the way and picks up MAGOG’s sword. GOG throws CASTIEL to the ground, and his angel blade falls out of his hand. MAGOG approaches DEAN but DEAN beheads him with the sword.]

[GOG approaches CASTIEL with his own sword and raises it.]

GOG

[speaking in ancient Canaanite] I hate doing this! You are very beautiful!

[DEAN comes up behind GOG and stabs him with the sword. He falls to the ground next to CASTIEL.]

DEAN

Forged by God, touched by God, same thing.

CASTIEL

[as he sits up] Yeah. Apparently.

[CASTIEL looks over GOG’s body and opens the wound. Sand and rocks pour out.]

CASTIEL

Dean, we have a problem. He isn’t human. He appears to be a primitive beast formed of rock and sand.

DEAN

That’s a thing?

CASTIEL

Yeah. A very old thing. I thought they had gone extinct during the flood.

DEAN

So what does this mean for us?

CASTIEL

[pours the sand and rocks out of his hand] it means… they don’t have hearts.

INTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, JAIL CELL – DAY

[MARY is standing by a window with iron bars.]

MARY

When Michael comes back, you… you let him kill me.

[JACK is still sitting on the floor.]

JACK

What?

[MARY crouches down in front of him.]

MARY

Do not open that door.

JACK

[stands up] No. No, we’re getting out of here.

MARY

[stands up] We can’t.

JACK

Yes, we can. I—I’m strong. I should be able to save us both, but every time I try to use my powers here, even things I know how to do, it’s all wrong. It’s just… my head, it… it doesn’t stop pounding.

MARY

Your head hurts?

[JACK nods.]

Mine, too. I—I’ve had migraines ever since they locked me in here. I… thought it was the torture. But maybe… maybe this place has warding so strong that humans can feel it.

JACK

You think that’s why my powers aren’t working?

MARY

My headache… I have it everywhere except… [she walks back to the window] right here. This is the only place it ever lets up.

JACK

Because the warding’s weaker.

MARY

Worth a shot.

[JACK walks to the window and presses his hand against the iron bars. His eyes glow as his powers start.]

JACK

It’s working.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, LIBRARY – DAY

[SAM is mixing ingredients at the table. DONATELLO walks in behind him. SAM’s phone is on the other table, vibrating as DEAN is calling. DONATELLO watches SAM as he presses the end button on SAM’s phone.]

SAM

Okay, I think that’s everything.

[DONATELLO picks up a bottle and walks up behind SAM.]

DONATELLO

Almost.

[DONATELLO hits SAM over the head. SAM falls to the floor. DONATELLO hits him again.]

ACT THREE

INTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, JAIL CELL – NIGHT

[MICHAEL is standing in front of the window. JACK’s powers have worked, and the iron bars have been melted through. ZACHARIAH is standing behind him.]

MICHAEL

Find him and bring him back to me.

ZACHARIAH

And the woman?

MICHAEL

Kill her, in front of the boy. Make her feel it.

[ZACHARIAH turns to leave.]

Zachariah. Don’t fail me again.

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD – NIGHT

[JACK and MARY are walking past the large spikes in the ground.]

JACK

How far till we’re safe?

MARY

Out here? I’m not sure there’s any such thing. Wait! Shh!

[They see a car in the distance and two men walking behind it. They run and hide behind a large tank. The men slowly walk past them. JACK looks out to see where they are.]

JACK

[whispers] I think they’re gone.

[A rifle cocks, as two red lasers appear on JACK and MARY. They stand up with their hands up. One of the men is Apocalypse World BOBBY.]

BOBBY

Are you angel, demon or human?

MARY

Human. We’re human.

[BOBBY recognises her as Apocalypse World Mary.]

BOBBY

Mary Campbell? It’s Bobby. Singer.

MARY

Bobby. My boys… they told me about you.

BOBBY

Your boys?

MARY

Dean and Sam Winchester.

BOBBY

Oh, I remember. The daytrippers, right?

MARY

You called me Mary Campbell. Do you know me?

BOBBY

Well, you knew you. The other you. She… well, hell, I thought you were a damn ghost. Turns out you’re just from a whole other world, which is… weirder when you think about it. [he looks at Jack] Who’s the kid?

MARY

Um…

JACK

[raises his hand] I’m Jack.

MARY

Friend of the family.

BOBBY

Well, that’s good enough for me. You better come with us.

[BOBBY and the other man lead JACK and MARY away.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, LIBRARY – NIGHT

[The bunker is completely trashed. DEAN and CASTIEL walk down the stairs.]

DEAN

Sam? Sammy!

SAM

Yeah, I’m right here!

DEAN

Tried to get a hold of you.

SAM

Yeah, well, um, I’ve been a little busy, Dean. Sorry.

[DEAN and CASTIEL walk through the war room and into the library. They see SAM sitting at the table, holding an ice pack to his head.]

CASTIEL

What happened?

SAM

Donatello happened. He… attacked me.

DEAN

The Muppet professor attacked you? Why?

SAM

I better just show you. Come here.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, ROOM 7B: DUNGEON – NIGHT

[DONATELLO is rambling to himself as he walks around a chair in the middle of the room. He is hearing whispering in Enochian.]

DONATELLO

… must bear witness to possess ability of it. To protect it. Yes. Protect the power. The power has been given you to tread… upon… your enemies!

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, LIBRARY – NIGHT

[SAM, DEAN and CASTIEL are watching DONATELLO through the camera in the dungeon, on SAM’s laptop.]

SAM

He attacked me. I didn’t wanna hurt him, but he—he just kept on coming at me, and… biting. So I had to lock him up in there. We were prepping the spell, and he just snapped.

DEAN

Yeah, I think it’s all a set up.

SAM

What?

CASTIEL

Gog and Magog, they can’t be part of the spell.

DEAN

Cause they don’t have hearts.

SAM

Wait a second. Then why did he…

CASTIEL

Because Donatello wanted them to kill us. He wants us dead.

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, REFUGEE CAMP – NIGHT

[BOBBY is leading MARY and JACK through a camp of war refugees. People are walking around on crutches, making fires, cooking.]

BOBBY

Well, welcome to home, sweet home.

JACK

What happened to them?

BOBBY

Angels happened.

JACK

Angels did this?

BOBBY

They’ve done worse. Two days ago, angels dive-bombed a colony in San Antonio. 400 people. Not a soul left alive. This ain’t a war. This is an extermination.

MARY

Bobby… Michael, he’ll be lookin’ for us.

BOBBY

Don’t worry. We got protocols protecting us. Wardings, lookouts in the trees, few other tricks up our sleeves. Besides, Mary Campbell saved my ass more than a few times. It’d be rude not to return the favor.

[BOBBY walks further, as MARY and JACK follow him.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, ROOM 7B: DUNGEON – NIGHT

[DONATELLO is now tied to the chair he was walking around. SAM and DEAN stand in front of him. DONATELLO is laughing.]

DEAN

Donnie. What happened, man? I thought we were friends.

DONATELLO

Friend? I see how you, both of you, look at me. Covetous. Well, God didn’t choose you for this part, Dean. He chose me.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, LIBRARY – NIGHT

[CASTIEL is watching the conversation on SAM’s laptop.]

SAM

[through the laptop] Donatello, whatever it is you’re feeling, whatever it is you’re going through,

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, ROOM 7B: DUNGEON – NIGHT

SAM

You can fight this.

DONATELLO

[laughing] I don’t wanna fight it. I… [looks at DEAN] you’re supposed to be dead.

DEAN

Sorry about that.

SAM

Was it the tablet that—that did this to you or—

DONATELLO

It didn’t do anything to me.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, LIBRARY – NIGHT

[CASTIEL continues to watch.]

DONATELLO

I translated the tablet. All of it! I saw the power of God! It’s all up here.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, ROOM 7B: DUNGEON – NIGHT

DONATELLO

And you wanna take it from me.

SAM

No, we don’t. That’s not true. We—we just wanna help you.

DONATELLO

[laughs] No. You just brought me here to use me and get your precious spell back. You’re wasting your time. And if it’s a little magic you wanna be seein’… [whispers] Suffocetur.

[DONATELLO flicks his hand towards DEAN.]

SAM

Donatello, listen, we…

[DEAN starts struggling for breath and reaches out to SAM. DEAN is choking and gasping.]

SAM

Dean? Dean! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, LIBRARY – NIGHT

[CASTIEL watches from the laptop as DEAN starts choking. He gets up and runs towards the dungeon.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, ROOM 7B: DUNGEON – NIGHT

[DONATELLO laughs maniacally as SAM grabs DEAN’s arm and wraps it around his own neck, supporting DEAN. They walk out of the room into the hallway. SAM holds DEAN against the wall. CASTIEL approaches.]

SAM

Dean! Dean!

[DEAN starts to breathe again.]

DEAN

I’m okay. I’m okay.

[CASTIEL looks into the room and glares at DONATELLO.]

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, REFUGEE CAMP – NIGHT

[JACK is making shadow puppets for the children of the camp, who are laughing. MARY is watching him as BOBBY approaches with two mugs, and hands her one.]

BOBBY

Go easy. I added a nip of whiskey.

[MARY drinks from the cup, as BOBBY looks at her.]

I don’t mean to stare. Just… you… you look just like her. Give or take a year or two.

MARY

What was she like?

BOBBY

Mary Campbell was a… complicated woman. Brave, but sad. Full of regret.

MARY

Let me guess. She made a bad demon deal?

BOBBY

Opposite. She didn’t make one. Lost the love of her life. Never moved on.

MARY

And Dean and Sam were never born. Bobby, I made that deal. And it—I brought my boys a lot of pain. But what happened here, in your world? Sam and Dean stopped that war in mine.

BOBBY

Then I’d say you made the right choice.

MARY

Huh.

BOBBY

Well, I don’t know much, but… I do know you done good by your boys. They hadn’t been here five minutes when they were trying to convince me to come with them to their world.

MARY

But you said “no”.

BOBBY

Mary… your world’s got your boys. This place? I’m pretty much all it’s got.

[They both look back at Jack, who is continuing to make shadow puppet animals for the children. However, he is now using his powers to make more complicated ones, like an elephant, an eagle and a stag. The children continue to laugh.]

BOBBY

What is he? A witch? Psychic?

MARY

Jack’s a Nephilim.

BOBBY

Excuse me?

MARY

He… he’s… half-angel, half—

BOBBY

I know what it means. Why I don’t get is why the hell you would bring one into my camp. You know what angels have done to us. I… I trusted you. I want him gone by morning.

MARY

If he goes, I go with him.

BOBBY

Well, then that’s your choice.

MARY

Yeah.

BOBBY

Look, Mary, when this all started, when Lucifer and his demon army rose out of Hell, we thought the angels were on our side. But one by one, they turned on us. He will, too. It’s just a matter of time.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER – NIGHT

[DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL walk into the room DONATELLO was working in. They start looking through his notes.]

DEAN

Alright, what else do we know? Besides all work and no play makes Donatello a homicidal boy?

SAM

Maybe—maybe something in the—the tablet snapped him.

CASTIEL

No, no. Prophets are conduits. Whatever’s in the tablets should just flow through them. I heard of one who was tempted once, but never fully corrupted.

DEAN

Well, Kevin translated it, and it was hard on him, sure, but he—he never went full-on psycho.

CASTIEL

Okay, so what was different about Donatello?

SAM

He doesn’t have a soul.

CASTIEL

What?

DEAN

Is that bad?

CASTIEL

Yes, that’s bad. Theoretically, the—the human soul would act as a filter inoculating the prophet against whatever darkness is in the tablet.

DEAN

Alright. Um, well, how do we fix him?

CASTIEL

I don’t think we do.

DEAN

Okay. Hold on.

SAM

We were so close. We almost had it.

DEAN

What are you talkin’ about?

SAM

Our plan, Dean. The spell, get mom back. Donatello’s soul is gone. That’s not just something you come back from.

DEAN

You did.

SAM

Yeah, because you convinced Death to get my soul back from the cage, but Amara ate Donatello’s soul. There’s nothing to get back. It’s gone.

CASTIEL

And Donatello’s already corrupted. I… perhaps the kindest thing to do would be to end his suffering.

[SAM and DEAN both look at CASTIEL.]

SAM

What?

CASTIEL

I don’t like it either. But if Donatello’s life ends, then another prophet comes into being and they can finish the translation.

DEAN

So what, you just wanna kill him?

SAM

No! No killing! We just need the spell.

CASTIEL

Fine.

[CASTIEL starts to walk out of the room.]

DEAN

Cas.

SAM

What are you doing?

[CASTIEL walks down the hallway towards where DONATELLO is. SAM and DEAN follow him.]

CASTIEL

What I have to.

DEAN

Hey!

SAM

Cas!

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, ROOM 7B: DUNGEON – NIGHT

[DONATELLO is still tied to the chair. CASTIEL walks in and shuts the door, locking it behind him.]

DEAN

Cas!

[DEAN and SAM bang against the door.]

Cas! Come on, let us in!

SAM

Cas! Oh, come on.

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, REFUGEE CAMP – DAY

[MARY is walking through the camp, and sees JACK sitting. He gets up and approaches her. She sees him smiling.]

MARY

You really like it here.

JACK

These people… everyone’s so brave.

MARY

But we can’t stay.

JACK

Why not? Because of me?

MARY

I’m sorry, Jack. It’s not fair.

[A siren starts blaring, as JACK and MARY look around to see people preparing. BOBBY runs towards them.]

BOBBY

We got incoming!

[JACK and MARY look up to see a bomb flying through the air. It lands right in front of them, throwing them back and to the ground.]

ACT FOUR

[JACK and MARY are on the ground as dust and rocks fall around them. ZACHARIAH and two other angels emerge from where the bomb dropped.]

MARY

Run!

[JACK and MARY get up from the ground and run away.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, ROOM 7B: DUNGEON – NIGHT

[CASTIEL is standing in front of DONATELLO.]

CASTIEL

The spell to open the gate—you gave us the wrong ingredients.

DONATELLO

Duh.

CASTIEL

But you know the right ones.

DONATELLO

I might. But like I told Sam and Dean, you’re wasting your time.

[CASTIEL nods, as he takes off his trench coat.]

CASTIEL

Well, I’m not Sam and Dean.

DONATELLO

What are you gonna do?

CASTIEL

I am going to do something that I promised I would never do to a human being without their permission. I’m gonna strip the spell from your mind.

DONATELLO

You—you—you—you can’t. I—I’ve absorbed too much power. Y-y-you’ll fry us both!

CASTIEL

I might.

[CASTIEL raises his hand and places it on DONATELLO’s head.]

DONATELLO

Ardeat intus—

[CASTIEL covers DONATELLO’s mouth and stops him from saying the spell.]

CASTIEL

I’m sorry, but I’m not going to let you or anyone hurt the people I love. Not again.

[CASTIEL places his fingers on DONATELLO’s head. DONATELLO screams. CASTIEL’s eyes start to glow.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, HALLWAY – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN listen through the door as DONATELLO screams.]

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD – DAY

[MARY and JACK are running through a forest, away from the angels. They stop as BOBBY stops in front of them. He looks at JACK.]

BOBBY

You. This is your fault.

MARY

What?

BOBBY

He used his powers. Must’ve been how they found us.

JACK

I didn’t… I didn’t mean to.

BOBBY

Well, ain’t that just gravy.

MARY

What can we do to help?

BOBBY

Here. Take this.

[BOBBY hands MARY a handgun.]

There’s a grain cellar, escape tunnels running underneath. Round up any kids you can find, get ‘em safe.

JACK

[to MARY] I’ll come with you.

BOBBY

You’ve done enough.

MARY

Jack… the angels, we can’t let them find you, so just… find some place and hide.

[JACK nods. MARY and BOBBY leave.]

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, ROOM 7B: DUNGEON/HALLWAY – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN are standing in front of the door, as it unlocks and slowly opens. They see CASTIEL putting his trench coat back on, with DONATELLO passed out in the chair. CASTIEL walks toward them.]

DEAN

Cas?

CASTIEL

Well, I know what we have to do.

[CASTIEL walks past them. SAM and DEAN walk into the dungeon to see DONATELLO.]

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, REFUGEE CAMP – DAY

[ZACHARIAH is holding a human up by the neck. He snaps it, and throws him to the ground. He turns to the other angels.]

ZACHARIAH

Find the child. Kill the rest.

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD – DAY

[JACK is running through the forest. He stops when he hears people screaming.]

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, REFUGEE CAMP – DAY

[A little girl is hiding behind a log as MARY approaches her.]

MARY

Okay. Shh, shh, shh. I’ve got you.

[ZACHARIAH approaches behind MARY.]

ZACHARIAH

Mary Winchester.

[The girl cries, as MARY gets her up from the ground.]

MARY

[to the girl] Run!

[MARY turns as she takes out her gun and aims it at ZACHARIAH. He knocks it out of her hand and punches her to the ground.]

ZACHARIAH

The half-breed… where is he?

[MARY stands up as she wipes the blood from her mouth.]

MARY

Go to hell.

ZACHARIAH

Witty.

JACK

Stop!

[ZACHARIAH turns to see JACK standing behind him.]

ZACHARIAH

Perfect timing. Enjoy the show.

JACK

I said… stop.

[JACK lifts his hand as a blast of his power hits ZACHARIAH. He raises ZACHARIAH off the ground, turning him to smoke. BOBBY runs up and stops next to MARY.]

BOBBY

More incoming!

[They look to the sky to see more angel bombs coming towards the camp.]

JACK

No!

[JACK lifts his hand and the angel bombs explode in the sky before they can reach the camp. MARY and BOBBY look at JACK as his glowing eyes stop.]

ACT FIVE

EXTERIOR – APOCALYPSE WORLD, REFUGEE CAMP – DAY

[BOBBY is crouching in front of one of the survivors.]

BOBBY

Rest easy. We got ya.

[MARY and JACK look at each other, as BOBBY approaches them.]

BOBBY

Well, I don’t know what to say except thank you.

MARY

Jack, what you did was amazing.

JACK

I had to come back. Sam and Dean, they wouldn’t run. They’d stay and fight. These angels, what they’re doing, they’re not gonna stop. As long as Michael’s out there, this war will never be over.

BOBBY

So what are you saying?

JACK

I have to kill him.

INTERIOR – THE BUNKER, WAR ROOM – NIGHT

[CASTIEL is pacing, as SAM and DEAN walk in from the door and down the stairs.]

CASTIEL

Well?

SAM

Well… guess you could say Donatello is alive.

CASTIEL

You told me not to kill him.

DEAN

Yeah, but, Cas, you turned him into… he’s brain dead. Machines keeping him breathing. What’s wrong with you?

CASTIEL

Nothing.

SAM

Cas—

CASTIEL

His soul was gone. He was corrupted. He was a danger to himself and to you and to all of humanity. Did you know that he was working with Asmodeus?

SAM

What? No.

CASTIEL

Not by choice, but he was. Some people just can’t be saved.

DEAN

Yeah, but who gets to make that choice? You? What exactly gives you the right?

CASTIEL

Nothing. I took it. And if I hadn’t acted, we would still be sitting around and talking about what to do next. We would be wasting time. And it’s time we don’t have, Dean. I told you, war is coming. War. And I did what soldiers do. Now we needed the spell to open the rift, and I got it. We need four major ingredients:

[SAM and DEAN listen and take in what CASTIEL is saying.]

the grace of an archangel… a fruit from the Tree of Life… the Seal of Solomon… and the blood of “a most holy man.” We find those things, we can bring everybody home. And together, we can beat Lucifer and Michael. This is the only way we win, and this is the only way we survive.

[DEAN and SAM continue to look at CASTIEL as they process what he is saying.]

It’s like you said, Dean. Whatever it takes.
