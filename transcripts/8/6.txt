NOW
EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT


Kearney, Missouri


A car pulls up and parks outside a house. In a covered area next to the house, a MAN is underneath his car working on it and listening to a radio. A WOMAN walks up and stands near the MAN’s feet.


MAN
Hey, hon. Just in time. Grab me a cold one, would ya?


WOMAN
[angrily] Why don't you have Sara Alcott get it for you?


MAN
What?


The woman kicks away the jack that was holding up the car.


MAN
Aaah! Oh, my God! Mary, help! Mary, what are you doing? Mary, what are you doing? Mary!


MARY gets in the car and starts the engine.


MAN
Help me!


MARY drives away as the MAN screams. Blood splatters a refrigerator upon which there is a large sticker that reads “The South Will Rise Again.”


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. FAT MACK’S RIB SHACK – DAY


DEAN is leaning against the IMPALA checking his phone. SAM walks up carrying a bag of food and two drinks.


SAM
Heads up. [He hands DEAN a drink and walks to the passenger side of the IMPALA.]


DEAN
I caught wind of a case on this police scanner. Sounds like our kind of thing.


SAM
I wasn't even gone ten minutes.


DEAN
Okay. That matters why?


SAM
I don't know, Dean. How about because you haven't said a word to me since Prentiss Island? And now, what? You want me to shut up and ride shotgun and act like nothing happened?


DEAN
You want to talk about Benny? Fine. Let's talk.


SAM
Okay. How about he's a vampire?


DEAN
He's also the reason I'm topside and not roasting on a spit in Purgatory. Anything else?


SAM
Don't pretend I don't get it. I know you had to do what you had to down there.


DEAN
I highly doubt you get anything about Purgatory.


SAM
But you're out now, and Benny's still breathing. Why?


DEAN
He's my friend, Sam.


SAM
And what about my friend, Amy? She was what? 'Cause you sure as hell didn't have a problem ganking her.


DEAN
Well, I guess people change, don't they? We let that werewolf Kate go, didn't we?


SAM
She was different. She – you think Benny's different? He tell you he's not drinking live blood, or something? And you believe him. Wow. Okay. You know, you're right. People do change.


DEAN
Yeah. I got a vampire buddy, and you turn your phone off for a year.


SAM
Don't turn this on me.


DEAN
Look, Benny slips up and some other hunter turns his lights out, so be it.


SAM
But it's not gonna be you, right?


DEAN
You coming or not? [He gets into the car.]


EXT. HOUSE – DAY


An ambulance leaves the driveway as the IMPALA pulls up and parks on the street outside the house.


IMPALA – DAY


DEAN and SAM are wearing their FBI suits.


DEAN
So, guy's old lady comes home while he's working underneath his ride, puts the pedal to the metal, and takes half his head off.


SAM
What, that's it?


DEAN
Yeah, in a nutshell. She says she blacked out, doesn't remember a damn thing.


SAM
Well, that sounds like insanity.


DEAN
Maybe.


SAM
So, how does that make this our kind of thing?


DEAN
Because, Sam, Kevin's in the wind, okay, you're sulking around like a eunuch in a whorehouse, and I can't help but ask myself, when is decapitation not my thing? [He gets out of the car.]


EXT. HOUSE – DAY


DEAN and SAM walk up to a sheriff’s line outside the house and hold up their badges.


DEPUTY
Whoa, whoa. FBI?


SAM
Yeah, happened to be in the neighborhood.


DEPUTY
First a Texas Ranger, now you guys?


DEAN
Texas Ranger?


DEPUTY
Yes, sir. Right over there. [He points to GARTH, who is interviewing a WITNESS. He is wearing a cowboy hat and tasseled leather jacket.]


DEAN
Oh, you got to be kidding me.


Music plays as GARTH takes off his hat and fans himself in slow motion. DEAN and SAM walk over to GARTH.


DEAN
Hey, Chuck Norris.


GARTH
Sam? Dean!


SAM
Shh.


GARTH laughs and hugs SAM.


SAM
Forgot he was a hugger.


GARTH
Come here!


DEAN
All right. Okay.


GARTH hugs DEAN.


DEAN
We're still – we're still working here.


GARTH
Uh, you guys have no idea how much I missed you.


DEAN
[to the WITNESS] Um, excuse us, would you?


GARTH
Yeah, we'll be right back.


DEAN, SAM and GARTH walk a short distance away from the WITNESS.


DEAN
A Texas Ranger, Garth? Seriously? We're in Missouri.


GARTH
What? Come on. I look like a funeral director in one of those. Wow. I heard some chatter you two were back in the batter's box, but I didn't believe it till now.


A cell phone plays Kris Kross' "Jump." GARTH opens his jacket to reveal three phones in a row in separate pockets.


GARTH
Oh, uh, one sec. Um... [He answers one of the phones.]


GARTH (on phone)
Yo, Earl. What you got? A revenant. Okay, uh, you'll need a casket and some silver spikes. Oh, and don't get bit. No, it won't turn you, but it will hurt like hell. Okay, so, once you got all that, nail that sucker in, bury him, and throw away the key. Okay? All right. Hasta.


DEAN
What are you doing?


GARTH
My job, hombre.


DEAN
Your job?


GARTH
Yeah.


DEAN
And since when is giving advice your job?


SAM
Hold up. Are you the new Bobby?


DEAN
You shut your mouth.


GARTH
Yes.


DEAN
You shut your mouth! What?


GARTH
Bobby was gone. You two were MIA. It was a weird time. Somebody had to step in and take up the slack. All right. Let's just get back to work, and we'll talk about this later, all right? [He walks away.]


DEAN
Did Garth just tell us what to do?


After a moment, DEAN and SAM follow GARTH, who has returned to the WITNESS.


GARTH
Uh, Scott Lew. These gentlemen here are with the FBI. Mr. Lew's parents were the individuals involved in this... unfortunate situation.


DEAN
Sorry for your loss.


SAM
Just a few questions, Mr. Lew. Um, by any chance were your parents having... marital problems?


SCOTT
No. Uh, no more than anyone else.


SAM
What about your mother's health? Any chance this was a seizure, a stroke, anything that might help explain this?


SCOTT
I don't think so. Um, they're checking her out at the, um, hospital right now.


DEAN
What about stranger behavior?


SCOTT
Stranger? How?


DEAN
Hearing voices, seeing things – your mother mention anything like that?


SCOTT
My parents were married for 30 years – high-school sweethearts. There's no good explanation for why this happened, no matter where you want to look.


GARTH
Okay, well, thank you, Scott. We'll be in touch.


SCOTT walks away. DEAN looks GARTH up and down.


CUT TO:


SAM is on one knee using an EMF reader in the covered area where the OLDER MR LEW worked on his car.


SAM
No EMF. No traces of sulfur anywhere. Like I thought – bust.


GARTH
Hold on there, Sam. There's a lot of things to factor in here. Uh, it happened last night, so the readings could be cold by now.


DEAN
Good point.


GARTH
And, uh, even if there was any sulfur, Barney Fife and his crew probably contaminated the whole crime scene and any evidence that was here with it.


DEAN
Wow. He's on a roll.


SAM
That's one word for it.


GARTH
Uh, guys, I think I found something.


GARTH lifts a foot. Green goo is stuck to the bottom of his boot.


DEAN
Is that gum, or is that ectoplasm?


SAM
Ectoplasm is usually black, right?


GARTH tastes the green goo.


GARTH
Mm. [SAM and DEAN grimace.] Definitely ectoplasm. [SAM and DEAN look at each other.] So, what are we thinking – uh, some kind of ghost, right?


DEAN snaps his fingers. One of GARTH’s cell phones plays Kool Moe Dee's "Wild Wild West." He answers it.


GARTH (on phone)
Uh, Ranger McCrae here.


DEAN
One of those things rings Hammer, I'm throwing down.


GARTH (on phone)
Oh, great. Okay. Okay. [He writes on his palm.] Thanks, Doc. [He hangs up.]


GARTH
Asked the coroner to drop me a line in case the autopsy turned up anything... unusual. And guess what. Our dead guy had the word "Alcott" [he shows SAM and DEAN his palm, on which he’s written the word] carved into his chest.


SAM
With what?


GARTH
Coroner's best guess? His wife Mary's fingernails.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


SAM, DEAN and GARTH are standing next to MARY LEW’s bed, to which she is handcuffed. A sheriff stands guard outside the room.


SAM
Mrs. Lew, can you tell us what happened?


MARY LEW
I was at the store getting groceries, and the next thing I know, my son Scott finds me in the driveway. And Chester was...


SAM
Do you remember anything at all about what happened? Um... Chester dying?


MARY LEW
Not really. Bits and pieces, I guess.


GARTH starts to giggle. He looks at DEAN and SAM and turns his giggle into a cough.


DEAN
Such as?


MARY LEW
I remember his screams... the smell of burnt rubber, and... I remember feeling so angry – just uncontrollable rage, like I wasn't myself. And after it was over, all that anger was – just gone.


GARTH
Uh, ma'am, does the word "Alcott" mean anything to you?


MARY LEW clenches a hand into a fist and tugs against the handcuff chaining her to the bed.


MARY LEW
What does she have to do with anything?


SAM
It's a she?


MARY LEW
My husband, Chester, and I were going steady in high school for a few years already when we had a big fight.


DEAN
What about?


MARY LEW
Something stupid, I'm sure. It was around prom, and so he took Sara Alcott as his date instead of me.


GARTH
So, this Sara Alcott was a rival for your husband's affections?


MARY LEW
Sara had one night with him, whereas I was with Chester for 37 years. [She starts to cry.]


SAM
Of course, right. Sure. Um, just one more question. Um... Is... Ms. Alcott still alive?


MARY LEW
As far as I know, yes.


DEAN
Thank you very much, Mrs. Lew.


EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEAN, SAM and GARTH walk towards the IMPALA.


DEAN
Let me get this straight. This poor guy goes to prom with some girl over 30 years ago, and because of that, he is now a pancake?


SAM
I mean, if this is a ghost, maybe it's some sort of possession?


DEAN
What are you talking about? You heard her. Alcott's alive.


GARTH
Well, we're definitely gonna want to talk to her.


DEAN
Yeah, sounds like a plan. Did we eat yet?


INT. BAR – DAY


DEAN, SAM and GARTH are eating at a table. A WAITRESS brings another plate.


WAITRESS
There you go.


GARTH
Mmm. Thanks. Keep 'em coming.


WAITRESS
All right.


GARTH
[talking with his mouth full] So, Dean, give me the skinny. Where were you this past year?


DEAN is eating a burger and SAM is eating what appears to be a chicken salad. Several plates they appear to have finished with are on the table.


DEAN
Why don't we save what I did on my summer vacation for another time?


GARTH
Aw, come on.


DEAN
All right. I was in Purgatory.


GARTH
Like the Purgatory Purgatory?


DEAN
No, the one in Miami.


GARTH
Man, that's balls.


DEAN
That's not how you say "balls."


GARTH
So how'd you get out?


SAM makes a show of looking at DEAN. DEAN looks around at a Confederate flag on the wall.


DEAN
What's up with all the, uh, hillbilly hankies? These people know the Civil War's over, right?


GARTH
Mm. That's a touchy subject around these parts. See, Missouri was a border state. So, half the men were Confederate, the other half were the Union.


SAM
How do you know all this?


GARTH
I went to college.


SAM
You went to college?


GARTH
Yeah. College, and on to dental school.


DEAN
What, you – you were a dentist?


GARTH
Yeah, just for, like, a hot minute. Where'd you think I got my first case?


DEAN
Let me guess - Tooth Fairy.


GARTH puts down his fork and looks down at the table.


GARTH
Yeah. Man, I felt terrible when I ganked that SOB.


SAM
Uh, you killed the Tooth Fairy?


GARTH
Yeah, man. I mean, not my proudest moment, but it happened. Mmm. Man, this is good.


CAR – DAY


SCOTT is driving. His phone rings as he parks and he answers it.


SCOTT (on phone)
Hey, hon. [A MAN walks towards the convenience store SCOTT has parked outside.] Uh, just, uh, grabbing some joe on the way to the hospital, gonna bring Mom her stuff. [The MAN sees SCOTT and waves.] Oh, crap. Jeff's here. Don't worry, I'll be fine. Okay. [JEFF goes into the store.] Love you.


SCOTT shakes an asthma inhaler and inhales from it. He takes some money from a bag next to him.


INT. CONVENIENCE STORE – DAY


SCOTT enters the store. Black goo runs from one of his ears. He starts to pour himself a cup of coffee. JEFF hurries up to him.


JEFF
Hey, Scott, how's – uh, look, I heard about what happened with your folks. I'm really sorry. If there's – there's anything – I mean, anything – that I can do, just – just ask, man. Please.


SCOTT
How about getting me my money back… [he flings hot coffee in JEFF’s face] …Jeff?!


JEFF falls to the ground, yelling in pain. SCOTT takes a shovel from a rack and stabs JEFF with it. Blood splatters a refrigerated cabinet. SCOTT stabs JEFF several more times with the shovel before dropping it to the ground and turning away. SCOTT looks up at a security mirror. His reflection flickers and then appears as a Confederate soldier with gray skin.


ACT TWO
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE – DAY


JEFF’s body lies on the floor, covered with a bloodstained sheet. DEAN and SAM, dressed in their FBI suits, walk over to it.


DEAN
So, first the mom goes "Natural Born Killer," and now the son? Well, what do we got – a ghost with an Oedipus complex? [SAM looks at him.] I don't know what that means.


SAM
Check that out. [He points to the refrigerated cabinet, upon which “Sussex” is written in blood.]


DEAN
"Sussex." What is that, another name?


SAM
I don’t know.


GARTH, who is wearing his Ranger jacket and a baseball cap, finishes talking to a sheriff and turns to SAM and DEAN.


SAM
Hey, what'd the cops say?


GARTH
Aw, come on. [He has stepped in green goo.] Not much. Uh, Scott insisted he wasn't in control of himself. Says all he remembers is a red-hot rage.


SAM
So, what is this, some – some kind of family curse?


DEAN
Is that Bobby's hat?


GARTH
Oh, yeah. Sure is. We worked a rugaru case together a few years back. He left it in my car, so I kept it as a... [DEAN takes the cap from GARTH’s head] …memento. What are you doing?


DEAN
That's not how you wear it.


DEPUTY
Gentlemen, surveillance is up… [DEAN tucks the cap under his jacket] …but something is all screwy with it.


CUT TO:


Security footage of SCOTT stabbing JEFF with the shovel plays on a television screen on the wall. SCOTT’s head is obscured by white light and there is a white line across the screen.


DEPUTY
Must be the camera.


GARTH
Yeah, thank you, there, deputy.


DEAN
You guys see the head? Ever seen anything like that before?


GARTH
Like that? No way.


SAM
So?


DEAN
So…


GARTH
So, I'm thinking we need to talk to Sara Alcott. I found her – although these days, she goes by Sara Brown.


SAM
How about this? I'll check her out, and you two see what you can find out about Sussex.


GARTH
Word.


DEAN
Awesome.


SAM looks pleased as he leaves.


EXT. SARA ALCOTT’S HOUSE – DAY


SAM and SARA ALCOTT are sitting in chairs on the porch. SAM is drinking iced tea.


SAM
Mmm.


SARA ALCOTT
Now, I know you didn't come all this way for my sweet tea, Agent.


SAM
No. Um, actually, I'm – I'm here about Chester Lew.


SARA ALCOTT
Oh, yes. So sad.


SAM
It is. Is it true you and Chester... dated a ways back?


SARA ALCOTT
Well, that is an odd question for the FBI, isn't it?


SAM
You wouldn't believe the awkward questions I've had to ask people.


SARA ALCOTT
[laughs] Yeah. Well, yes. Yes. Me and that old tomcat, Chester, we went to prom together. That's about it.


SAM
And that's all?


SARA ALCOTT
Well, I wasn't exactly a good girl, if that's what you mean. And after that, I-I thought that Chester and I were gonna be hot and heavy. But it just wasn't meant to be. And, uh, a week later, he eloped with Mary.


SAM
Did you speak much to Mary or Chester again after that?


SARA ALCOTT
Well, I'd see them about, you know – picnics and such. But... Mary kept Chester on a pretty short leash. Honestly, I'd moved on, but it seems she never did.


SAM
And why do you think that is?


SARA ALCOTT
Well, I guess in her mind, I was a reminder of Chester's betrayal.


SAM
Huh.


SARA ALCOTT
So, if that's all...


SAM
Yes, uh, thank you very much for your help.


SARA ALCOTT goes inside and SAM walks away. He pauses and looks back at the house.


FLASHBACK


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


An empty bottle of alcohol lies on its side next to two glasses on a table. Clothes are strewn across the floor, coffee table and sofa. SAM and AMELIA are in bed together, AMELIA lying across SAM’s chest.


AMELIA
It's been a long time since I let myself go like that.


SAM
Yeah, I know what you mean.


AMELIA
You asked me if I lost someone. I did. My husband. He died in Afghanistan eight months ago.


SAM
That must have been, um... I... I can't imagine.


AMELIA
Yeah. We were together forever. Or at least it seemed that way. Then one day, Don just enlists. Didn't ask me, just said something about wanting to do the right thing. Next thing I know, he's off overseas and I'm all alone. I got a couple letters, some phone calls, and then a knock at the door. Just like that. And everywhere I looked, all I could see was judgment and pity and just this constant reminder of Don everywhere. So I moved here... and became even more of a hot mess than I already was. And you hit a dog.


AMELIA and SAM hold each other and close their eyes.


EXT. SARA ALCOTT’S HOUSE – DAY


SAM comes out of his reverie, looks back at the house again and walks away.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


DEAN and GARTH are sitting at the table. GARTH is reading a journal and DEAN using the laptop while drinking a beer. GARTH reaches for a beer that is on the table between them, but DEAN prevents him from taking it.


DEAN
Easy there, flyweight. Last time you drank a beer, I had to pick you up off the floor.


GARTH
You're such an idjit.


DEAN
Idjit's supposed to be used angrily. Okay? Not happy. If you're gonna butcher it, don't say it at all.


GARTH
Whoa, then. Okay. N-none of my business, but... this have anything to do with you and... Sam?


DEAN
No, you had it right. It's none of your business.


GARTH
Okay. It just seems that you guys are a little tense around each other.


DEAN
We're fine. Can we get back to work?


GARTH
Yeah.


DEAN
Okay.


GARTH
All right. Just, uh – just letting you know that I'm here for you, for anything. I know sometimes Bobby, he would –


DEAN
You're not Bobby! Okay? You're never gonna be Bobby, so stop!


GARTH
Bobby belonged to all of us, Dean – not just you and Sam. Now, I'm just taking what he showed me and trying do something with it. That's all!


DEAN
[more softly] Why don't you see if you can find something in that bourbon-drenched book of his so we can get the hell out of Dixie, all right?


GARTH
Yeah. I'm on it.


DEAN
Hey. "Sussex" is not a who, it's a what. It's a business that went belly-up about a year ago. Look at this. [He turns the laptop towards GARTH. On the screen is an article about the bankruptcy of SCOTT LEW and JEFF BULT’s tire company.] So, the guy that Scott brained? His old business partner – ran the company into the ground.


GARTH
So, Scott had a beef with Jeff.


DEAN
Looks like. [His phone rings and he answers it.]


DEAN (on phone)
Hey, you're on speaker. [He puts the phone down on the table.]


SAM (on phone)
Sara Alcott's clean, if you look past the fact that she and Chester knocked boots on prom night back in the day. [SAM is leaning against the IMPALA outside SARA ALCOTT’s house. The remainder of the scene alternates between DEAN and GARTH in the motel room and SAM outside SARA ALCOTT’s house.]


DEAN
Okay, so... Mary has a grudge against Sara, and Scott has a grudge against Jeff. Besides the fact this is making my head hurt… [GARTH is reading a page about spectres in the journal] …how does this add up to a ghost?


GARTH
Guys! Bobby has it right here. Green goo equals a spectre.


DEAN
Which equals ghost, right?


GARTH
Mm, yeah, kind of. A spectre is an avenging ghost. It, uh – it possesses you and finds out whatever betrayals you're feeling and forces you to act on them.


SAM (on phone)
Bobby say anything in there about how we hunt these things?


GARTH
Uh, the last spectre he encountered rose shortly after someone desecrated a nearby grave. [He searches for “grave, vandalism, Kearney” in the Federal Criminal Database.] Which... [A Kearney Sheriff’s Office investigation report appears on the screen.] Uh, there was a grave desecrated locally three days ago. It says here... Oh. This could get awkward.


DEAN
What?


EXT. CEMETERY – DAY


DEAN, SAM and GARTH approach a tomb outside which a uniformed guard stands.


DEAN
The unknown soldier? You're kidding me, right?


GARTH
Mary Lew steamrolled her husband the day after this place was vandalized. Do the math.


SAM
But I thought the unknown soldier was buried in Arlington.


GARTH
Yep, but this is the Confederate tomb of the unknown soldier. See, the idea was, they took a faceless, nameless soldier they couldn't identify, and they buried him here to commemorate all the soldiers who died.


DEAN
Did you learn that in college?


GARTH
Nope – Civil War re-enactments. Once a year, every year. Don't hate.


SAM
Okay, uh, what about the guard?


GARTH
Uh, he's ceremonial. Gone by dusk.


DEAN
So, then we do this tonight?


GARTH
Yeah.


SAM
Burn a Confederate soldier's bones in a town full of rednecks? Sure.


EXT. CEMETERY – NIGHT


The IMPALA drives into the cemetery.


CUT TO:


Flashlights shine on Confederate soldier headstones. DEAN, SAM and GARTH approach the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.


INT. TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER – NIGHT


DEAN, GARTH and SAM enter the tomb.


SAM
Place doesn't look disturbed to me. What's the police report say?


GARTH
Uh, they think it was just some kids messing around. They, uh – they found some beer cans, some graffiti. Oh, and the casket was open when they got here, but they closed that back up.


DEAN
Yeah, but not before Casper had a chance to make a run for it.


SAM
So, what? If they never touched this, none of this would be happening?


GARTH
Yeah, according to Bobby.


DEAN
All right, well, let's get this party started.


SAM picks up a circle of thin cord from the floor.


DEAN
Sammy, you want to give me a hand? And... go.


DEAN, GARTH and SAM push the heavy stone lid of the casket aside. Inside the casket lies a skeleton in a uniform, with a sword and gun.


GARTH
Whoa. Check out this hardware. Do you guys know how much this is worth?


DEAN
Yeah, but why open it up if you're not gonna take anything?


SAM
I don't know. Maybe the cops showed up and they had to split fast.


GARTH
You sure this will work, even on a spectre?


DEAN
It's a ghost, isn't it? You burn its bones, the ghost disappears.


SAM pours lighter fluid over the skeleton and DEAN prepares to set it alight.


DEAN
All right.


GARTH
All right. All right. All right. Uh, I kind of feel like we should say something, all right? Don't you? Just... a little...


DEAN looks at SAM.


DEAN
Sure. We won.


DEAN strikes a match and sets the skeleton on fire.


INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE – DAY


A folder lands on a DEPUTY’s desk.


SHERIFF
Write that up for me, would you, Doug?


DOUG (DEPUTY WALLACE) watches the SHERIFF return to his desk.


SCOTT
[huskily] Help!


SCOTT is in a holding cell, holding a hand to his chest and struggling to breathe.


SCOTT
Please!


DEPUTY WALLACE
Hey. You okay?


SCOTT
Need my... asthma... inhaler. From evidence. Please.


DEPUTY WALLACE goes into the evidence room and tips the inhaler and a set of keys into his hand from an envelope on a shelf. There is a strange noise and black goo runs from his left ear. He takes a rifle from a cabinet and points it at the SHERIFF, who is eating lunch at his desk.


DEPUTY WALLACE
Why don't you write your own reports, Sheriff?!


The SHERIFF screams as DEPUTY WALLACE fires.


ACT THREE
INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE – DAY


A crime scene investigator photographs blood on the wall behind the SHERIFF’s desk.


MAN
All right. We’re set. [The SHERIFF’s body is on a stretcher, covered with a bloodstained sheet.] Let’s go.


OTHER MAN
Yeah.


The MEN push the stretcher away. DEAN, GARTH and SAM stand around the SHERIFF’s bloodstained desk.


DEAN
Ten bones says Deputy Doug had an axe to grind with his boss.


GARTH
How can you be so sure?


DEAN points to green goo on the SHERIFF’s tape dispenser.


GARTH
Ah, what the hell?


DEAN
Maybe we torched the wrong redneck.


SAM
Or maybe not. Maybe an object was removed from the grave, something the spectre's attaching itself to.


DEAN
Like Bobby's flask?


GARTH
Um, I don't know, guys. You saw what I saw. Those kids didn't take anything.


SAM
Or they did.


DEAN
And this spectre hitched a ride with it.


SAM
And whoever has the object gets possessed.


GARTH
Okay. So, who's got the object, and, more importantly, who do they got a grudge against?


CUT TO:


SAM, DEAN and GARTH are in a holding cell with DEPUTY WALLACE.


SAM
All right. We need you to focus, Deputy. Other lives depend on it. Tell me what happened after you shot the sheriff.


DEPUTY WALLACE
I was on the ground. I think Karl tackled me, and I asked him what happened.


DEAN
And?


DEPUTY WALLACE
He didn't answer me. He just took my gun and walked away.


DEAN
Did he say where he was going?


DEPUTY WALLACE
I guess... I must have hurt him, too. He said he was going to the hospital.


DEAN, GARTH and SAM leave the cell.


DEAN
You two find out what you can about the unknown soldier. I got the hospital.


DEAN walks away.


EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY


A sheriff’s vehicle pulls up outside the hospital. DEPUTY KARL grabs a rifle and gets out. He glances in the side vision mirrors and we see his reflection change to that of a Confederate soldier.


EXT. LIBRARY – DAY


GARTH and SAM get out of GARTH’s vehicle and walk towards the library.


GARTH
Hey, uh, Sam. If you ever need to talk, I just want to let you know that I'm here. About anything – you know, life, uh, Dean, you.


SAM
I'm okay. Thanks.


GARTH
I mean, it just seems like you and Dean are talking but nobody's listening to each other. I had this cousin once – well, he's gone now – but his name was Frank. Frank and I used to build...


GARTH goes inside the library. SAM stands on the steps outside.


FLASHBACK


EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


SAM wakes and rolls over.


SAM
Hey.


AMELIA is dressed and carrying a handbag.


AMELIA
Hey. Uh, just lock up when you leave. I'm late. [She picks up her keys.]


SAM
Wait, what?


AMELIA
I just think it's better if neither of us get the wrong idea here.


SAM
O-okay.


AMELIA
And I know I said a lot of things last night, and I know I can't ask you to forget them. But just... Do.


SAM
Why?


AMELIA
Because I don't need your pity. I don't need you looking at me the way they all – like that.


SAM
Wait, um... you think this is pity? Amelia, I'm glad you told me about Don. It helps me understand.


AMELIA
How messed up I am? You think I don't know that? You don't have to feel sorry for me, Sam.


SAM
I didn't mean it like that.


AMELIA
Yeah, well, like I said, I'm late. So...


AMELIA leaves the room.


EXT. LIBRARY – DAY


GARTH opens the front door of the library and speaks to SAM, who is still standing on the steps.


GARTH
Hey, you comin'?


EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEAN gets out of the IMPALA, which is parked behind the sheriff’s vehicle. DEAN glances in the open window of the sheriff’s vehicle and walks on.


INT. LIBRARY – DAY


A LIBRARIAN is leading SAM and GARTH through the library.


LIBRARIAN
You do know there is a good reason he's called the unknown soldier, right?


SAM
Right. Uh, we were just hoping maybe a theory or two had been a floated around over the years – something local, maybe?


LIBRARIAN
There is one. [She takes a book from a shelf.]


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


A WOMAN and a MAN in hospital employee uniforms are laughing together on opposite sides of the reception desk when a shot shatters a pane of glass next to them. They scream and duck for cover. DEPUTY KARL points his rifle at the MAN. He has black goo coming from his right ear.


DEPUTY KARL
Hey, ump. You remember me? I stole second!


MAN
Karl? What the hell are you doing? Why are you doing –


DEPUTY KARL
Why am I gonna make mustard from your brain stem?! I don't know. Why did you call me out, ump?


MAN
I'm sorry.


DEPUTY KARL pulls the trigger, but the gun doesn’t fire.


DEAN
Looks like you're shooting blanks.


DEPUTY KARL turns to face DEAN. DEAN grabs the rifle and punches DEPUTY KARL.


DEPUTY KARL
Hey, that tickled.


DEPUTY KARL punches DEAN, who falls heavily to the floor. DEPUTY KARL grabs DEAN and pulls him to his feet again.


INT. LIBRARY – DAY


The LIBRARIAN is turning pages in a book as she speaks to SAM and GARTH.


LIBRARIAN
Corporal Collins of the Union shot and killed his brother, Vance, who fought for the Confederacy. Local boys. [We see a photograph of VANCE in the book.]


SAM
Wait, so two brothers fought on opposite sides of the Civil War?


LIBRARIAN
Legend has it that Vance swore vengeance on his brother with his dying breath. Years later – consumed by guilt, no doubt – the corporal dug his brother up where he'd buried him on the battlefield and brought him home.


GARTH
Are you suggesting this Vance guy is the unknown soldier?


LIBRARIAN
That's one theory, anyway.


SAM
What's that? [He points to the photograph, in which VANCE is wearing a necklace with a round disk pendant.]


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEPUTY KARL is holding DEAN by the throat.


DEAN
Karl, listen, I know the spectre's turning the temperature up in there. So just tell me what the object is, and we'll send this joker home.


DEPUTY KARL
I don't think so. There's unfinished business, thanks to you. [He sniffs DEAN.] Oh, the spectre likes you.


DEAN
Oh, yeah? Why don't you tell him to come on out here and we'll make promise bracelets.


DEPUTY KARL flings DEAN onto and over a desk.


INT. LIBRARY – DAY


LIBRARIAN
Most of the soldiers were poor farmers, so... [she turns to another page in the book, which shows a close-up of a 1859 Indian Head penny on a string] ...the families would give them a penny on a string. It was for good luck, and in case they ever got lost, they always had a penny for food or drink.


SAM
A penny.


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


DEPUTY KARL holds up a penny with a hole drilled through it.


DEPUTY KARL
Here. Have a taste.


He presses the penny into DEAN’s palm.


EXT. LIBRARY – DAY


SAM and GARTH leave the library. SAM is on the phone.


DEAN’S VOICE ON PHONE MESSAGE
It's me. Do what you gotta.


SAM (on phone)
Dean, hey. There was a string on the floor of the tomb. It used to hold an old penny. That's the object. We're coming right now.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


SAM and GARTH enter. SAM has his phone to his ear and we hear a phone ringing in the room.


SAM
Dean? What the hell, man? We went to the hospital. [DEAN is sitting on a bed. His ringing phone is next to him.] You're not answering your phone.


DEAN has black goo running from his right ear. He stands up and points a gun at SAM.


DEAN
You should have looked for me when I was in Purgatory.


ACT FOUR
EXT. CEMETERY – NIGHT


Three Days Ago


Soundgarden's "Fell on Black Days" plays.


INT. TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN CONFEDERATE SOLDIER – NIGHT


Teenagers drink beer and look into the casket. One points a gun that was in the casket. Another takes the penny on a string from around the skeleton’s neck. He breaks the string off and puts the penny in his pocket.


♪ Whatsoever I've feared has come to life ♪

♪ Just when every day... ♪


The teenager who took the penny uses it to pay for purchases at a convenience store.


♪ ...seemed to greet me with a smile ♪

♪ Sunspots have faded, and now I'm doing time ♪


The cashier gives the penny as change to MARY LEW. We see a flashback of MARY LEW kicking the jack out from under the car CHESTER LEW was working on.


♪ 'cause I fell on ♪

♪ black days ♪


SCOTT LEW takes the penny from MARY LEW’s bag, which is next to him on the seat of his car. We see a flashback of him stabbing JEFF with the shovel.


♪ I fell on ♪

♪ black days ♪


We see a flashback of DEPUTY WALLACE going into the evidence room and tipping the inhaler and keys into his hand.


♪ How would I know that this could be my fate? ♪


We see that in addition to the inhaler and keys, he also tipped the penny into his hand.


♪ How would I know that this could be my fate? ♪


We see a flashback of DEPUTY WALLACE shooting the SHERIFF. The penny drops from DEPUTY WALLACE’s hand onto the floor.


♪ How would I know that this could be my fa-a-te? ♪


DEPUTY KARL handcuffs DEPUTY WALLACE and picks up the penny from the floor. The scene then cuts to a flashback of DEPUTY KARL pressing the penny into DEAN’s hand.


♪ I sure don't mind a change ♪


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY


DEAN is pointing his gun at SAM.


SAM
Come on, Dean. I know it's not you in there pulling the strings.


DEAN
Shut up! [to GARTH, who makes a move towards his belt for a weapon] Don't! [to SAM] You never even wanted this life. Always blamed me for pulling you back into it.


SAM
That's not true.


DEAN
Really? 'Cause everything you've ever done since you climbed into my ride has been to deceive me.


SAM
What do you want me to say? That I've made mistakes? I've made mistakes, Dean.


GARTH
That's not Dean, Sam.


DEAN
Shut up! Mistakes? Well, let's go through some of Sammy's greatest hits. Drinking demon blood, check. Being in cahoots with Ruby. Not telling me that you lost your soul. Or how about running around with Samuel for a whole year, letting me think that you were dead while you're doing all kinds of crazy. Those aren't mistakes, Sam. Those are choices!


SAM
All right. You said it. We've both played a little fast and loose.


DEAN
Yeah, I might have lied, but I never once betrayed you. I never once left you to die. And for what, a girl? You left me to die for a girl?


SAM put a hand on the gun and punches DEAN. He pushes DEAN into a glass pane, which breaks, and punches DEAN twice more. DEAN backhands SAM, headbutts him, then kicks him across the room. SAM falls to the floor, then pulls himself up to lean against a sofa.


GARTH
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [He gets between DEAN and SAM.]


SAM
Garth, don't.


GARTH
No, he won't kill me. His beef isn't with me. You're not gonna shoot me, are you, Dean?


DEAN
[pointing the gun at GARTH] Move.


GARTH
Come on, Dean. You do not want to kill your brother. You – you've been protecting him your whole life. Don't stop now.


DEAN
He left me to rot in Purgatory!


GARTH
All right. All right. Maybe he did. I don't know. I wasn't there. But I'm sure he had his reasons.


SAM
Just like you had your reasons for Benny.


GARTH
Who?


DEAN
Benny has been more of a brother to me this past year than you've ever been! That's right. Cas let me down. You let me down. The only person that hasn't let me down is Benny.


GARTH
I know you're angry. But, man, you got to fight this thing. Do not do this! Just let it go. Come on, Dean.


DEAN
Goodbye, Sam.


DEAN tries to push past GARTH. GARTH punches him. The penny drops from DEAN’s hand.


GARTH
[shaking the hand he used to punch DEAN] Ow! God!


GARTH picks up the penny.


SAM
Garth, don't!


GARTH
It's cool. It's all good. I'm cool.


DEAN touches the black goo on his ear. SAM sighs. GARTH looks at the penny.


ACT FIVE
EXT. MOTEL – NIGHT


GARTH walks to his vehicle, carrying a bag. DEAN follows him.


GARTH
It took me forever to melt that penny, but it's finally gone.


DEAN
How come that penny didn't jack you like everyone else? I mean, I can understand why it didn't affect the kid who took it. He's young and innocent. But, uh, everyone at some point in their life feels like they've been screwed.


GARTH
Not me, man. I let all that stuff go with the help of my yogi, my Sega Genesis. And you should, too. You can't change the past, amigo. Now, there's something I want to say to you. Stop being a idjit! With Bobby dead, you and Sam are all each other has. And that's not so bad, man. Now, you know what's coming next, right? [He spreads his arms slightly.] Come on.


DEAN
[looking away] Oh...


GARTH
Come on.


DEAN
Yeah, okay.


GARTH hugs DEAN.


DEAN
Hey, uh... [He takes BOBBY’s hat out of his back pocket and puts it on GARTH’s head.] Keep on truckin', Garth.


GARTH
Thanks. [He touches the brim of the cap in salute. One of his cell phones plays M.C. Hammer's "U Can't Touch This."] Oh, got to go.


GARTH (on phone)
Yo, Lamar. What do we got? Wendigo? [He gets into his vehicle.] You got a flare gun? No? What about a flame thrower? [He laughs.] Then you'd better get some sneakers, buddy, 'cause you're gonna have to run. All right.


GARTH tries unsuccessfully to start his vehicle. He slams a hand on the steering wheel.


GARTH
Balls!


GARTH tries again to start his vehicle, this time with success. He gives DEAN a thumbs-up and drives away.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


SAM is wiping his face with water at a sink. There is a knock at the door.


FLASHBACK


EXT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


SAM is knocking on AMELIA’s motel room door. She opens it.


AMELIA
Sam, I can't. [She starts to close the door, but SAM stops her.]


SAM
I don't pity you. Okay? I don't. You and I – we're a lot of things, but we're not to be pitied. Look, I lost my brother, Dean, a few months ago. It felt like my world imploded and came raining down on me, and... I ran. Just like you.


AMELIA
Is that supposed to be a pep talk?


SAM
Yeah, uh, sort of.


AMELIA
Because... See, now I pity you.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


SAM follows AMELIA into the room. AMELIA is holding an empty glass.


SAM
Well, I mean, that wasn't really my point. [SAM closes the door behind him. AMELIA picks up another glass.]


AMELIA
Yeah, well, bell's rung on that one, so...


They sit down on the sofa and AMELIA pours whiskey.


SAM
So, uh... so what now?


AMELIA
I don't know. You want to talk about it?


SAM
Last night?


AMELIA
No. Dean, you pervert.


SAM
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Do you want to talk about Don? [He reaches a hand towards her.] Hey, I'd like that, too. [AMELIA covers his hand with her own.]


The flashback ends.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


We hear more knocks. SAM is looking at himself in the bathroom mirror.


DEAN
[from outside the motel room] Sammy!


There are more knocks at the door. SAM sighs and slowly walks out of the bathroom.


EXT. MOTEL – NIGHT


SAM closes the trunk of the IMPALA.


SAM
For the record, the girl – her name's Amelia. Amelia Richardson. She and I had a place together in Kermit, Texas.


DEAN
Look, man, I don't even remember what I said, but, uh –


SAM
But what? But you didn't mean it? Oh, please. You and I both know you didn't need that penny to say those things.


DEAN
Come on, Sam.


SAM
Own up to your crap, Dean. I told you from the jump where I was coming from, why I didn't look for you. But you? You had secrets. You had Benny. And you got on your high and mighty, and you've been kicking me ever since you got back. But that's over. So move on, or I will.


DEAN
Okay. I hear you.


SAM
Good. [He walks towards the passenger seat and faces DEAN over the car.] You know what? Hear this, too. I just might be that hunter that runs into Benny one day and ices him.


DEAN
I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, won't we?


SAM
Yeah. Yeah. You keep saying that.
