TEASER
TITLE: NOW

EXT. ST. ANNE'S CATHEDRAL; GARDEN – NIGHT

Two PRIESTS, one young, one old, are walking through the garden together.

OLD PRIEST

Monsignor Cassidy will join us for dinner on Saturday. And mass, of course. He can be a pain, so let's have everybody on their toes.

They stop as they round a corner and are confronted by two ANGELS in grey suits.

FEMALE ANGEL

Gentlemen. We're looking for a man we believe you may know. His name is Castiel.

INT. ST. ANNE'S SHELTER FOR MEN; LOCKER ROOM – DAY

Various men are wandering about, chatting, getting changed etc. CASTIEL stands up from the basin and looks at himself in the mirror. He is wearing regular clothes as opposed to his usual trench coat. He picks up a tube and squirts a glob of toothpaste directly into his mouth as a MAN approaches.

MAN

Hey, Clarence. How much longer you gonna be with us?

CASTIEL

(Chewing on the toothpaste)

I'll be moving on tonight after work. It's time.

The MAN nods and hangs up his towel.

CASTIEL

Can I ask you something?

MAN

Sure.

CASTIEL walks into one of the bathroom stalls.

CASTIEL

Do you ever tire of urinating? I'll never get used to it.

EXT. ST. ANNE'S CATHEDRAL; GARDEN – DAY

Various men from the shelter are helping with the gardening – mowing the lawn, raking leaves etc. CASTIEL is picking up trash but stops when he notices something on a rock. He touches it – blood.

Finding some more blood on a nearby gate, CASTIEL follows the trail through to the back part of the garden where the blood trail ends at a large smear on a statue. CASTIEL looks up to find the two PRIESTS from before, skewered through the chest on fence spikes with their eyes burned out.

TITLE: SUPERNATURAL

ACT ONE
INT. BUNKER – DAY

DEAN is pouring himself coffee. He looks like he's just woken up and is wearing a bathrobe. He strolls from the kitchen to the main room, then to the library.

DEAN

Sam! You here?

Right on cue, SAM enters through the front door carrying a takeout container.

SAM

Hey! Morning.

DEAN checks his watch.

DEAN

You've been outside already?

SAM

Yeah. Woke up, went for a run – beautiful sunrise. Anyways, cleaned up, went and got breakfast, grabbed you real bacon and eggs, extra grease, not even gonna argue.

He puts the container on the table and they both sit down.

DEAN

Mm, perfect. Wait. You went running?

SAM

What? Why do you look so worried?

DEAN

Let's see. There's Cas, who I told to haul ass here. That was days ago. He's still out there. Um, there's you.

SAM

Me? I feel great.

DEAN

I'm sure you do, but, Sam, you went through the trials. Okay, that put a big strain on you. I just think it's better if you took it easy, you know, and didn't act like you were-

EZEKIEL takes over.

EZEKIEL

Possessed by an angel. And he does feel better. A work in progress, of course, but I am slowly healing him.

DEAN

That's great. Um, but, Sam—

EZEKIEL

I have news. I've picked up chatter among the angels. Not all are wandering around in confusion.

DEAN

Yeah, some of 'em are after Cas.

EZEKIEL

There is a faction that is rapidly organizing and finding human vessels to contain them.

DEAN

Led by Naomi?

EZEKIEL

I have not heard that name, no. But it is this faction's leadership who want Castiel found. You see, Dean, I can be useful.

DEAN

So can my brother. So, why don't you go check your e-mail, and if I need your help, I'll let you know.

EZEKIEL

Dean.

DEAN

I said I'll let you know.

EZEKIEL switches back to SAM.

SAM

I mean, you know, Cas is human now. It's gonna take him a lot longer to travel.

DEAN

(To himself)

I'm gonna get whiplash.

SAM

What?

DEAN

Nothing. Um, all right, so, I was thinking that if the angels are organizing, then that makes them a lot more dangerous than we thought.

SAM

Why do you think they're organizing?

DEAN pauses, trying to quickly think of a way to cover his slip up.

DEAN

It makes sense. My point is, is that the more of them that are after Cas, the worse it is, so... we gotta find him.

INT. PHARMACY – DAY

The PHARMACIST is standing at the front desk, watching a video on his smart phone. The video is titled "GOIN' FOR GLORY HOUR" and is hosted by Reverend BUDDY BOYLE.

CUT TO: EXT. PARK – DAY

Another MAN is watching the same video and nodding in agreement with it.

BUDDY

(On the video)

Folks, like I've been telling you, we're in that most sacred of times. A legion of angels reaches out for us. Can you feel their divine presence? And if you do, there's nothing to fear. Heck no! If the angels come a-knocking, you just let 'em on in and fill yourself up with their Grace. This is the Reverend Buddy Boyle in the "Goin' for Glory Hour" wishing you a most blessed day. Amen.

CUT TO: INT. CHURCH – DAY

BUDDY is preaching live from his church.

SECRETARY

(O.S.)

And we're clear.

MAN

Beautiful, buddy. One of your best.

BUDDY

Oh, well, that is high praise, sir, seeing as how you're an emissary of the man upstairs himself. Thank you, Bart.

The MAN is revealed to be another be-suited angel.

BARTHOLOMEW

It's Bartholomew. And I have to say, God has personally assured me that he is highly pleased with your work. He prepareth a special reward for helping him populate a true heaven on earth.

BUDDY

Well, between you and me, it's practically reward enough being one of the few humans of all time to get orders from an actual angel. But if he prepareth I am honored.

BARTHOLOMEW

Terrific.

The SECRETARY, a young girl, enters.

SECRETARY

Sir? I'm ready.

BARTHOLOMEW

Oh?

SECRETARY

Let me be a vessel for the divine. I give myself over to you.

BUDDY

Oh. Hallelujah!

BARTHOLOMEW

Yes. Well... if you're certain.

She nods excitedly. BARTHOLOMEW raises his hands and two streams of brilliant white light enter through the windows. They converge and enter the SECRETARY through her mouth.

BUDDY smiles for a moment before a crunch is heard. The SECRETARY starts breathing heavily as she begins to bleed from every place and her face starts to melt. She finally screams and literally explodes, blood splattering around the room.

BUDDY

Bart! What the hell?

BARTHOLOMEW

Buddy... the simple truth is, not all who are willing are designed to contain heaven's Grace. We have to expect a casualty now and then. It's a small price to pay when you think about it.

BUDDY

Like the lamb of the sacrifice.

BARTHOLOMEW

Sure.

INT. BUNKER; LIBRARY – DAY

DEAN is poring over a map of Colorado and the surrounding states. There are radius circles drawn at intervals around Colorado. SAM is on his laptop.

DEAN

All right, so this is where Cas called from on Tuesday – Longmont, Colorado. Each circle is how far he might have gotten in one, two, and three days out.

SAM

Okay. Here we go. The same day he called from Longmont, weird murder, same town. Cops said it was like the girl was blasted from the inside out.

DEAN

Angel kill. They might have just missed Cas. Unless they got him.

SAM opens another news article on his laptop.

SAM

You got an Emory Park, Iowa?

DEAN

(Checking the map)

Emory Park, Emory Park. I just saw that. Yeah, a couple days outside of Longmont.

SAM

Okay, because two priests were murdered there Thursday. Eyes blown out, evidence of torture. They were impaled on posts.

DEAN

Torture?

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Angels are looking for info. Man, if they get to him before we do...

SAM

Yeah.

EXT. HOMELESS CAMPING GROUND – NIGHT

A group of homeless people are taking shelter for the night. CASTIEL is eating a tin of beans with another HOMELESS MAN.

CASTIEL

Thank you. I was so hungry. Very kind of you to share.

HOMELESS MAN

It's okay.

CASTIEL

You know, I'm finding that often people with the least to give are the most generous. Anyway... I've got to plan better. I ran out of food very quickly today.

HOMELESS MAN

You're new at this, aren't you?

CASTIEL

Food... sleep, or passing gas, it's all very strange. And it's occurred to me that one day I'm gonna die.

CASTIEL and the HOMELESS MAN just look at each other curiously.

CASTIEL

Well... I better try falling asleep. It's quite a process, isn't it?

HOMELESS MAN

Try counting sheep.

CASTIEL

Thanks once again.

CASTIEL gets up and walks away to an abandoned bus. He steps in and finds a seat, using his jacket as a pillow and his overshirt as a blanket.

CASTIEL

What sheep?

CUT TO: EXT. HOMELESS CAMP – NIGHT (LATER)

CASTIEL has fallen asleep on the bus. The PHARMACIST from before is standing outside, watching him. CASTIEL wakes up and looks outside but the PHARMACIST is suddenly gone. He is obviously possessed by an angel.

CASTIEL, wielding his angel blade, cautiously gets up and goes to the open door of the bus. There is nobody outside. He turns to go back to his seat only to be face to face with the PHARMACIST. He slices CASTIEL across the shoulder and CASTIEL gasps in pain.

PHARMACIST

You're human?!

CASTIEL swiftly turns and stabs the PHARMACIST in the stomach. A bright white light shines from the PHARMACIST'S eyes and mouth before he finally collapses. CASTIEL gasps again, his shoulder now bleeding profusely.

ACT TWO
EXT. ST. ANNE'S CATHEDRAL; GARDEN – DAY

DEAN is in his FBI suit and is talking to the MAN from the shelter that was speaking to CASTIEL previously.

MAN

Yeah. Yeah, I think I know this guy you're talking about. Sounds like Clarence.

DEAN

Clarence?

MAN

The church – it runs a shelter in town, and we work here. We earn our keep. Clarence spent a couple nights, and then had to move on.

DEAN

And he left the day the bodies were found?

MAN

Matter of fact. Oh, man, those poor guys were a mess. They must have suffered bad. But at least now they're with the angels.

DEAN

I sure as hell hope not.

(The MAN'S face falls)

Clarence happen to mention where he was headed?

MAN

No. He just said he always had to keep going.

CUT TO: INT. IMPALA – DAY

SAM is in his suit too, and typing on his laptop. DEAN gets back into the car.

DEAN

All right. Well, he's definitely been here. Good news is he's getting cagey. He's using a fake name – Clarence.

SAM

That's what Meg used to call him. Of course, he doesn't get that's the name of a pretty famous angel.

DEAN

What?

SAM

"It's A Wonderful Life."

DEAN shakes his head.

SAM

Dude, seriously?

DEAN

(Defensively)

What'd you come up with?

SAM

Another angel kill, outside a town called Lafayette about a day's travel east of here.

DEAN

What is that, Indiana?

SAM

Yeah. Body was found in a homeless camp. Insides barbecued, the whole nine.

DEAN

Homeless guy?

SAM

No, a pharmacist from Dayton.

DEAN

Huh.

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

CASTIEL is walking amongst the bustling people. He reaches a hot dog stand and stops, looking longingly over the food. He looks to the money he has in his hand – he probably has no more than $20 in small notes and loose change. He glances up at the shop next to him – a tattoo parlor. It seems like he is struggling to make a decision.

He finally decides to enter the tattoo parlor. He hands the tattoo artist his money, then pulls up his shirt and points out a section of his abdomen. The tattoo artist nods and indicates for CASTIEL to take a seat.

INT. CHURCH – DAY

FEMALE ANGEL

Reverend Boyle's influence is astonishing.

BARTHOLOMEW

I'll never understand these people.

FEMALE ANGEL

Our fallen brothers and sisters are finding vessels faster than we'd even hoped.

BARTHOLOMEW

They better. And then they need to help us find Castiel. You know, the one you let slip through your fingers?

FEMALE ANGEL

Our Dayton operative is tracking him.

BARTHOLOMEW

Good, because frankly, you're hanging by a thread.

A MALE ANGEL knocks on the door.

BARTHOLOMEW

What?

MALE ANGEL

Our operative did manage to find Castiel, but Castiel was somehow able to kill him.

BARTHOLOMEW

What?!

FEMALE ANGEL

He's a madman, sir, and very dangerous.

BARTHOLOMEW

No. I'm very dangerous. Now you will find this madman, and you will destroy him. Do you understand?

MALE ANGEL

That may not be possible, sir.

BARTHOLOMEW

I'm getting a little tired of you.

MALE ANGEL

Castiel has vanished. We're unable to track him. He must have found a way to ward himself against us.

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

CASTIEL is once again wandering through the noise and the people. He is trying to take everything in – he glances from a hot dog stand to a woman's breasts to a supermarket. The whole place is noisy and crowded and confusing. He is overwhelmed.

INT. CHURCH – DAY

CASTIEL enters and walks down the aisle. He chooses a pew about halfway down and sits. He looks around at the various angel decorations but his attention is drawn to the only other occupant – a WOMAN in one of the front-most pews, praying out loud. CASTIEL observes her curiously.

WOMAN

Please, Lord. Mike is such a good man. Please send your angels to heal him. Thank you for hearing me. Amen.

She makes the sign of the cross across her chest and gets up to leave. She stops when CASTIEL speaks to her.

CASTIEL

Mike is your husband?

She nods.

WOMAN

He's very sick.

CASTIEL

Yes. Humans – so fragile. I never – never realized how fragile until recently.

WOMAN

I guess that's why we pray. When you get dealt such a bad hand sometimes, you need something stronger than yourself.

CASTIEL

That's a wonderful idea, but...

CASTIEL sighs and turns away, looking at an angel in one of the stained glass windows.

WOMAN

What?

CASTIEL

What if you were to find out that no one is listening? That God had pretty much left, that Heaven had gone out of business? What would you do?

WOMAN

But that's not possible.

CASTIEL

I think it's completely possible.

WOMAN

You're missing the point. It's not possible because I have my faith.

CASTIEL

But when I tell you the truth-

WOMAN

Your truth, not mine. Your lack of faith doesn't cancel what I believe. That's not how it works. You know... I think you might feel better if you tried it my way. Someone is listening.

She leaves.

INT. CHURCH – DAY

BARTHOLOMEW is speaking with a tough-looking man. Note: BARTHOLOMEW and CASTIEL are in different churches.

BARTHOLOMEW

The issue is, he somehow managed to ward himself against us. Our ability to track him has been jammed, which brings us to you.

REAPER

My kind, we always get what we're looking for, chief.

BARTHOLOMEW

Yes, reapers. But some of you have taken your skill set to a whole new level...

REAPER

That's the rumor.

BARTHOLOMEW

...and are willing to freelance. For a price. That's the rumor.

REAPER

(Smiles)

Jump start me. How do I start looking for this... Castiel?

BARTHOLOMEW

I got one word for you. Winchester.

INT. POLICE STATION – DAY

DEAN and SAM are back in their suits and are walking and talking with the POLICE CHIEF.

POLICE CHIEF

Damnedest thing I ever saw. Vic had a stab wound, but it's not what killed him. It's like his insides were-

DEAN

Vaporized? It's been going around.

SAM

So, this guy was a pharmacist from Ohio?

POLICE CHIEF

Apparently. Total family man, religious. One day, just hops in the SUV, takes off, dies under a bridge here from God knows what. This is his stuff. Help yourselves.

The POLICE CHIEF hands them two plastic evidence bags and leaves.

SAM

Thanks.

DEAN

Thanks.

They open the bags and go through the contents, which are pretty standard – wallet, keys, watch, pen, etc. SAM picks up a miniature Bible while DEAN starts flicking through the man's smart phone.

SAM

Anything?

DEAN

Nothing weird. Crappy music, a lot of podcasts, all the same one. Reverend Buddy Boyle's "Goin' for Glory Hour."

SAM

Cop said he was religious.

DEAN plays one of BUDDY'S podcasts.

BUDDY

(On video)

Join me in a heapin' helpin' of glory, friends. When you're in the presence of the divine, you'll know it. And if you let yourself, you'll hear it.

(DEAN skips ahead in the video)

So, remember, when angels come a-knocking, let 'em on in.

DEAN and SAM look at each other knowingly.

SAM

Angels can't possess a human without permission, right?

DEAN

Yep.

SAM

So, what, they're using this guy to find vessels?

DEAN

It's a willing audience. They're all religious types like our pharmacist here. Buddy Boyle was telling them to let the angels take them over.

SAM

Like body snatchers.

DEAN

How big a reach does this Boyle guy have?

SAM does a quick search on the computer and brings up the "Global Influence" page from BUDDY'S website. There are red dots over virtually all major cities in the entire world.

SAM

Pretty much the entire planet.

They get up and leave quickly, revealing the REAPER was sitting behind them the entire time.

ACT THREE
EXT. ALLEY – DAY

CASTIEL is going through a dumpster when a kitchenhand dumps some food scraps in a nearby can and goes back inside. CASTIEL moves over to the scraps; he digs through them, pulls out a pickle and sniffs it. He stops, drops the pickle and turns as a WOMAN approaches him from behind.

CASTIEL

I'm not stealing.

WOMAN

And I'm not a cop.

CASTIEL

It's a shame, isn't it? So much is wasted when there's so many hungry. I never knew.

The WOMAN pulls a plastic-wrapped sandwich out of her bag and holds it up.

WOMAN

Peanut butter and jelly?

She walks up to CASTIEL and offers it to him, smiling.

WOMAN

It's pretty good.

CASTIEL

No, I can't take your food.

WOMAN

You're not. I'm giving it to you. Look, I've had hard times myself.

She puts the sandwich in his hand and walks to the back door of a nearby restaurant.

CASTIEL

Thank you.

WOMAN

Yeah.

She smiles and nods, then goes inside.

EXT. HOMELESS CAMP – DAY

DEAN and SAM are trying to convince the homeless people to give them information on CASTIEL.

DEAN

Look, for the billionth time, we're just looking for some information, okay? We're not cops. I mean, do we look like cops?

The homeless people all look amongst each other and nod.

DEAN

Well, we're not cops. We just need to find a friend who's in it deep.

SAM

Look, he might have been here the night that guy was killed. Were any of you here then?

The HOMELESS MAN from before comes down.

HOMELESS MAN

Maybe.

DEAN

Oh, okay. Uh, he's- he's got dark hair, blue eyes, a little out of it.

SAM

He maybe called himself Clarence?

HOMELESS MAN

Clarence, yeah.

SAM

You two talk?

HOMELESS MAN

Not much.

DEAN

And, uh...?

HOMELESS MAN

I think he was on the run.

SAM

You see him with the vic- uh, victim?

HOMELESS MAN

No.

DEAN

Okay...

HOMELESS MAN

He went off to sleep in another part of the resort.

DEAN

Where?

HOMELESS MAN

He's not there now.

The REAPER appears in the distance, watching SAM and DEAN.

SAM

Where'd he go?

HOMELESS MAN

I saw him running from under the bridge to the highway.

DEAN

You gonna pay us for all this teeth pulling? Where was he headed?

HOMELESS MAN

He flagged a truck heading north. Detroit, probably.

SAM

Why Detroit?

HOMELESS MAN

Truck was marked "Motor City Meats".

EXT. ALLEY – NIGHT

It is raining fairly heavily. CASTIEL is huddled up against the wall in a tiny alcove, but he is still soaked through. He is next to the door that the WOMAN went through before. She comes out and opens her umbrella. She makes to run home through the storm but stops and turns when she notices CASTIEL.

CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

The WOMAN has taken CASTIEL home to shelter from the storm. CASTIEL gazes around the apartment as she locks the door.

CASTIEL

Wow, it's beautiful.

WOMAN

If you say so. Uh, just so you know, I don't usually bring home strange men.

CASTIEL

Am I strange?

WOMAN

No, I mean... men I don't know. But you look like you've been to hell and back.

CASTIEL

Yeah, a few times.

APRIL

April, by the way. April Kelly.

CASTIEL

Um, Castiel.

APRIL

One name?

CASTIEL

Yeah, like God.

APRIL

Or Cher?

She smiles and hands him a towel. As CASTIEL dries himself off she glances as his shoulder wound.

WOMAN

Uh, not to raise any red flags, but do you know your shirt's soaked in blood?

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are exiting the store and heading back to the car, DEAN carrying a bag of groceries. SAM is holding a plastic container with pie inside.

SAM

Look at these chemicals. Do you even read the label?

DEAN snatches it and puts it back in the bag.

DEAN

No. I read "pie". The rest is just "blah, blah, blah". Listen, when we hit Detroit, we start with the homeless shelters.

SAM

Right, then go to the encampments, soup kitchens.

DEAN

Check out places that he might have gone looking for work.

They pass a payphone the REAPER is standing at. He follows them inconspicuously.

SAM

Yeah, and I can – I can check for vagrancy arrests.

DEAN

Yeah, and, you know...

(Mimes a head exploding)

Odd deaths.

DEAN and SAM round a corner, but when the REAPER follows them seconds later, they are nowhere in sight. The REAPER starts down the street cautiously when DEAN and SAM appear out of nowhere and slam him up against a chain link fence, an angel blade and Ruby's knife against his throat.

SAM

Who are you?!

DEAN

Why are you trailing us?

INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

APRIL drops CASTIEL'S rag into the sink. CASTIEL is sitting on the bed, shirtless.

APRIL

You call this rag a bandage? You're lucky this wasn't infected. What happened to the guy who attacked you?

CASTIEL

Oh, I stabbed him. He exploded.

APRIL mulls this over and eventually seems to decide that CASTIEL is joking.

APRIL

Funny. You don't look like the knife-fight type. Or the homeless type, actually.

She starts cleaning his wound.

CASTIEL

Yes. Well... I guess I trusted the wrong person.

APRIL

Bad investment advice?

CASTIEL

No, vanity. I thought I was more important, more effective than I am, that I could... fix everything. Now all I can do is keep running.

APRIL

Well, all patched up, but, God, your delts are in knots. You got to relax.

CASTIEL

Ah, it's all new to me. Hunger. Cold. This feeling, being all alone.

APRIL

You're not alone tonight.

She kisses him gently on the cheek, but stays close and eventually kisses him on the lips. CASTIEL seems surprised at first but then joins in.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE – NIGHT

The REAPER'S wrists are cuffed to an overhead beam; DEAN and SAM are interrogating him, occasionally slashing him with the angel blade.

DEAN

So, Maurice. You bounty hunters are like Delta Force reapers. Why would they sic you on Cas?

MAURICE

He warded himself.

DEAN

Naomi hire you?

MAURICE

(Chuckles)

You really are out of the loop. Naomi's dead. Resting in pieces.

SAM

So then who's running things now?

DEAN

Answer!

MAURICE

Her protégé, Bartholomew. He's an up-and-comer.

SAM

So he figured we'd lead you to Cas.

DEAN

This Bartholomew, he organizing the angels?

MAURICE doesn't respond so DEAN slashes him with the angel blade again.

MAURICE

That's all I know.

DEAN puts the tip of the blade to MAURICE'S throat.

MAURICE

You can kill me. It won't matter. If I don't find Castiel, there are others that will. But do what you want.

DEAN

Sure.

DEAN pushes the blade through MAURICE'S throat and kills him.

INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT

APRIL and CASTIEL are lying in bed, nude. There are lit candles everywhere. They have clearly just had sex.

APRIL

Well, say something.

CASTIEL

There aren't words.

APRIL

So, that was okay?

CASTIEL

Very much so. Um... what I did, that was, uh... correct?

APRIL

Very much so.

CASTIEL

(Smiling)

Good.

They laugh.

APRIL

Castiel... I can't help thinking, all that stuff you said earlier, blame... and guilt. It seems like you're taking on a heavy load for such a sweet guy.

CASTIEL

Believe me, I've done a lot of foolish, unwise things. I'm no angel.

APRIL

Well, whoever you trusted... can't they help undo this?

CASTIEL

We're not in contact.

APRIL

So what happens next for you?

CASTIEL

More of this, I hope.

They smile and start making out again.

EXT. ROAD – DAY

The Impala drives into Detroit.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

CASTIEL comes out of the bedroom, buttoning up his shirt. APRIL is cutting fruit in the kitchen.

APRIL

Oh. I washed your stuff. Find everything okay?

CASTIEL checks through his things.

CASTIEL

As a matter of fact, something is missing.

APRIL

Oh?

CASTIEL

It was with my jacket. It's hard to describe.

She spins around, suddenly threatening, with his angel blade in her hand and holds it to his throat.

APRIL

Oh, you mean this?

ACT FOUR
EXT. PARKING LOT – DAY

DEAN pulls the car to a stop.

SAM

What's up?

DEAN

We've been chasing our tails all night. No Cas. "What's up?" I'm fried. I think it's time for plan B.

SAM

I'm not following.

DEAN

(Meaningfully, to EZEKIEL)

I'm letting you know.

SAM

O-okay. Um, letting me know what?

DEAN

(Stronger)

I'm letting you know.

EZEKIEL finally takes over.

EZEKIEL

What is it, Dean?

DEAN

I need your help.

EZEKIEL

That is flattering. We've been through this. I cannot be making public appearances.

DEAN

Oh, I understand that. I'm not asking you to walk the red carpet, Zeke, okay? I need your help finding Cas.

EZEKIEL

It cannot be done. He is warded.

DEAN

I know that, but maybe you can use your intergalactic, hyperspace, X-ray eyeballs to find someone else. There might be a reaper for rent on his ass. Could you find them?

EZEKIEL

I could try.

EZEKIEL begins to focus his "angel radio".

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

CASTIEL is tied to a large lounge chair. APRIL is twirling his angel blade menacingly.

APRIL

It's probably pointless, washing the blood out of your shirt, really. It's the kind of thing the real April would have done.

She takes a bite of the grapefruit she cut earlier.

APRIL

I miss being her. Very sweet. Didn't mind me entering her one bit.

CASTIEL

Why didn't you just attack me right away?

APRIL

My briefing said you were dangerous and powerful. And you did arrive armed, so... I needed information, so I had to gain your trust.

CASTIEL

And that required intercourse?

She laughs.

APRIL

Well, I am allowed some leeway for executive decisions.

She straddles his lap.

APRIL

And I can't say I didn't find you attractive.

CASTIEL

Who hired you? I assumed with Naomi gone, things were in chaos.

APRIL

New sheriff in town, Cas. He hired a bunch of us. I got lucky.

She gets up and walks behind CASTIEL.

APRIL

Enough questions from you. I have several of my own. Let's talk about your buddy Metatron.

She makes a quick slice on his injured shoulder.

EXT. ROAD – DAY

The Impala speeds further into the city.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY (LATER)

CASTIEL'S shirt is wide open and he has multiple large gashes across his chest, bleeding everywhere.

APRIL

All right, let's try this again, and one of these times, we'll get it right.

CASTIEL

I knew nothing about Metatron's spell. I didn't know he was gonna cast the angels out of Heaven. I was cast out, too.

APRIL

Oh, dear. Nothing but reruns on this channel.

She stabs him lightly in the chest and holds it there.

APRIL

These blades are marvelous, aren't they? They really do a number on humans, too.

CASTIEL

I told you last night, and I meant it. I was naive. I had no idea what he was planning.

She pushes the blade in a little further.

APRIL

You're lying. It's known you helped Metatron enter Heaven, collaborated with him.

CASTIEL

'Cause we were going to restore Heaven, bring the factions together.

She slices his chest again.

CASTIEL

He lied to me.

She grabs him by the hair.

APRIL

You were with him when he unleashed the spell. You know how the angels were cast down!

CASTIEL

I didn't know he was assembling a spell.

She stabs him again.

CASTIEL

I only knew that I was the final ingredient.

APRIL

You?

CASTIEL

My Grace. That's why I'm human. He took my Grace for the spell.

She puts the blade to his throat.

APRIL

Or you gave it.

CASTIEL

It may be unwise to kill me. If my Grace were the key to empowering the spell, I may be key to countering it.

APRIL

Are you negotiating with me, Castiel?

Suddenly the door bursts open and DEAN and SAM run in.

DEAN

Cas!

Seeing the boys, APRIL turns and swiftly stabs CASTIEL straight through the chest. DEAN draws his own angel blade and the brothers run at APRIL but she effortlessly uses her angel powers to fling DEAN into the kitchen bench and SAM into the closet across the room. She kicks DEAN'S angel blade away as she makes her way over to SAM.

APRIL

This girl's popular with all the boys.

DEAN eyes the angel blade still sticking out of CASTIEL'S chest. SAM gets up to face APRIL but before he can make a move she punches him across the face and sends him back to the floor. APRIL turns around just in time for DEAN to stab her in the chest, killing her in a flash of brilliant white light. DEAN turns to CASTIEL.

DEAN

Cas. Cas. Cas!

DEAN shakes CASTIEL but he is cold and unmoving. DEAN'S voice breaks.

DEAN

Cas! No.

SAM regains consciousness and rises from the floor as DEAN realizes:

DEAN

Sam, he's gone.

SAM approaches CASTIEL, quietly and solemnly. DEAN looks up and realizes that it's actually EZEKIEL, not SAM. EZEKIEL kneels down and gently places his hand over CASTIEL'S chest. With another bright white light, all of CASTIEL'S wounds quickly heal themselves.

EZEKIEL finally finishes healing CASTIEL and stumbles backwards, weakened. CASTIEL gasps back to life as EZEKIEL slumps back to the floor, unconscious again. DEAN goes to help EZEKIEL/SAM but stops and turns when CASTIEL speaks.

CASTIEL

Dean.

DEAN

Hey. Hey! Yeah.

SAM wakes up again, evidently shocked by the scene he's woken up to.

CASTIEL

And Sam.

SAM

Cas. You're okay.

CASTIEL looks equally as confused as SAM.

DEAN

(To CASTIEL)

Never do that again!

CASTIEL

All right. But I'm confused. I know she stabbed me, but I'm – well, I don't appear to be dead.

DEAN quickly invents another lie and turns to SAM.

DEAN

Well, you got dinged.

(To CASTIEL)

And, uh, you. I made a deal with her. Said she wouldn't get kabobed if she brought you back. She brought you back.

CASTIEL

You lied.

DEAN

I did. I do that.

ACT FIVE
INT. BUNKER; MAIN ROOM – DAY

SAM and DEAN are walking and talking. DEAN is eating a burrito.

SAM

You know, you never answered my question. How did you know where to find Cas?

DEAN

I told you. I went through Maurice's pockets. I found an address and took a shot.

SAM

I never saw you go through Maurice's pockets.

DEAN

What are you talking about? I don't see half of the nerdy stuff that you do. It doesn't mean that you don't do nerdy stuff.

CASTIEL enters, wearing fresh clothes and looking clean for the first time in a while.

CASTIEL

I am really enjoying this place. Plentiful food. Good water pressure. Things I never even considered before. There really is a lot to being human, isn't there?

DEAN

It ain't all just burritos and strippers, my friend.

CASTIEL

Yeah. I understand what you're saying.

SAM

You do?

CASTIEL

Yes, there's more to humanity than survival. You... look for purpose, and you must not be defeated by anger or despair. Or hedonism, for that matter.

DEAN

Where does hedonism come into it?

CASTIEL

Well, my time with April was very educational.

SAM

Yeah. I mean, I would think that getting killed is something.

CASTIEL

And having sex.

DEAN chokes on his burrito for a second.

DEAN

You had sex with April?

SAM

Yeah, that would be where the hedonism comes in.

DEAN

Shh.

CASTIEL and SAM nod awkwardly to each other.

DEAN

So... did you have protection?

CASTIEL

I had my angel blade.

DEAN

Oh – oh, he had the Angel blade.

SAM

Um...

CASTIEL

In any event, I – I do now see how difficult life can be and how well you two have led it. And I think you'll be great teachers.

DEAN

Thanks, Cas.

CASTIEL

Are there any more burritos?

DEAN

Uh, yes.

He points towards the kitchen and CASTIEL walks away. DEAN chuckles as EZEKIEL takes over.

DEAN

Our little Cas. He gave it up to a reaper. That is—

EZEKIEL

Castiel cannot stay here. He will bring the angels down on all of us.

DEAN

No, no, he's got the Enochian tattoo. He's warded.

EZEKIEL

He was warded when April found him, and she killed him.

DEAN

Yes, and you brought him back, and I thank you for that, but this is Cas, okay, who vouched for you when I didn't know you from Jack. The bunker is safe.

EZEKIEL

Bartholomew is massing a force. We cannot stand an incursion. Castiel is in danger, and if he is here, I am in danger.

DEAN

Wait, you're in danger? From who, the angels?

EZEKIEL

If he stays, I am afraid I will have no choice but to leave.

DEAN

Oh, no, you can't do that. Sam's not well enough. If you leave his body...

EZEKIEL

I know. I am sorry.

DEAN goes into the library, where CASTIEL is sitting at the table, happily eating a burrito.

CASTIEL

This ethnic food. I can't get enough.

DEAN

Cas, uh, can we talk?

CASTIEL

Of course.

He pulls out a chair for DEAN.

CASTIEL

Dean, you know I always appreciate our talks, our time together.

DEAN sits on the table and lays it down.

DEAN

Listen, buddy. Um... You can't stay.

CASTIEL just looks at him, confused and hurt.
