Teaser
Deserted streets are shown around the world – Kyoto, New York City. In Hastings Minnesota, Sam and Jack wander along an empty street where all the people have disappeared. Dean arrives in the Impala.


Sam: Everyone's gone. You see anybody on the way here?

Dean: No.

Sam: I couldn't save anybody. Billie...

Dean: It wasn't Billie. It was Chuck.

Sam: What?

Jack: Where's Cas?

Sam: Dean?

Dean: He saved me. Billie was coming after us, and Cas summoned the Empty. It took her. And it took him. Cas is gone.

Sam: This can't be happening.

Dean: It is, Sam. I think everyone's gone.

Sam calls Jody's phone and gets her voice mail: "Hey, it's Jody. I can't get to the phone right now, so leave a message."

Dean: Jack, I'm sorry.

Sam calls another number. Another voice message: "Hey. You know who it is. You know what to do. Catch you later."

We pull back from the Winchesters and Jack on the empty street, up and up until we see the Earth from a distance….which explodes into the title card.

Act One
Int. Sam and Dean enter a deserted diner "Sammy's highway Café" Music is playing. The TV shows a deserted football field.


Dean: It brings a whole new meaning to the term "sudden death."

Sam: Dean, do you think we're it? All that's left?

Dean: Yeah. You, me, Jack.


Outside the diner. Jack looks up at the sky.


Jack: Cas?


As Jacks in front of the diner, the plants he passes shrivel and die. He does not notice. Jack enters the diner.


Jack: Hey. So, um, what now?

Sam: I did this. We could have just given Chuck what he wanted, you know, his grand finale. But I resisted. I pulled the thread. I thought we could beat this game, do it better. We tried to rewrite him, and the whole world paid the price.

Dean: Sam, we can...

Sam: We can what? There's nothing left, Dean. No one left to save. Everybody's gone.

Jack: You can't just give up.

Sam: What other choice do we have?


Ext. Night. Sam and Dean stand in front of the Impala.


Sam: Think he'll show?

Dean: He better.

Chuck: Hey, guys. Enjoying a little alone time?

Dean: Alright, Chuck. You win.

Chuck: Well... sure. I always do. Me being me. Is that it or...

Sam: We'll give you what you want. That's right.

Dean: The whole Cain-and-Abel thing. Us dead. Whatever. I'll kill Sam. Sam will kill me. We'll kill each other. Okay? You pick. But, first, you got to put everything back the way it was. The people, the birds, Cass. You got to bring him back.

Sam: We're surrendering. We're giving up.

Chuck: Yeah, no. I mean, I appreciate the white flag, but, frankly, it's too little, too late. I'm kind of enjoying this story now.

Dean: You can't.

Chuck: Oh, no, see, I'm the almighty. I really can. I mean, picture it. The two of you... And your little lapdog Jack... Rotting on a lifeless planet, knowing it's this way because you wouldn't take a knee. Eternal shame, suffering, and loneliness. Whew! That's deep. That's sophisticated. That's a page-turner.


Act Two
Interior. The Bunker.

Jack is alone in his room. Sam finds Dean asleep in the library amongst a pile of bottles.


Sam: Dean? Hey. Look out. You okay?

Dean: I feel terrific.


Jack enters the library.


Jack: Guys, I'm... feeling something weird.

Dean: Yeah, me, too, pal. We need aspirin.

Jack: I'm sensing a presence. There's something out there... besides us.

Sam: Something like people? I don't know.

Dean: How are you sensing anything? I thought you were all powered down.

Jack: I'm not sure. But I feel it.


Ext. Day. The Winchesters and Jack stop at the Tod and Bizz gas station. As Sam pumps the gas, Dean is headed to the toilet when he hears whimpering and sees a dog.


Dean: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Look at you. Hey. (Dog whimpers, sniffs) Wow. (Laughs) How did Chuck miss you? Whoever thought finding a dog would feel like a miracle? Come on, Miracle. Come here. Sammy. Check it out.


Sam: You found a dog?


Dean: Yeah. I guess Chuck didn't get everything. I mean, maybe there's people he missed, you know? Look, either way, this guy's coming home with us.


Sam: You're gonna let a dog sit in the Impala?


Dean: Relax. I'm not giving him shotgun. Unless you're cool with that. I'll get Jack. (Dog whimpers) Don't worry about him. He'll warm up to you. Maybe we'll let you sleep in his room. (Dean puts the dog in the back seat of the Impala) Here we go. Good boy. Hey. Come here. You know, believe it or not, you're the best thing that's happened in the last few days. Yeah, you are. Good boy.


The dog suddenly vanishes. Dean looks up to see Chuck in the distance.


Int. Night. The Impala. Jack is asleep.


Dean: Unbelievable. Can't even save a friggin' dog.

Sam: Yeah, maybe that's the point. No one left to help. No one but us.


Ext. Night. St Michael's Church.


Sam: You sure about this, Jack? Whatever you're picking up on is in there?

Jack: In there or very nearby. Guys, I have no idea what we're walking into.


Int. Church.


Michael: So... you survived.

Sam: Michael.

Michael: When the rapture first began, I took refuge here. It is St. Michael's, you may have noticed.

Dean: Are you hiding out from your dad?

Michael: I'm sure he's aware I took your side against him. I've avoided using any powers that might attract his attention.

Sam: And Adam?

Michael: Gone. I'm sorry to say. Exterminated by my father, like everyone else.

Dean: Poor bastard never caught a break.

Michael: How did the three of you manage?

Dean: Apparently, your old man has a sense of humor. He thought it would be hilarious to watch the three of us on an empty planet.

Sam (looks at open Bibles): What, are you, uh... doing some reading?

Michael: I never spent much time on Earth. I was... curious about the perception of God and Heaven.

Dean: And?

Michael: Amazingly, the believers loved him. They have for thousands of years. I guess my efforts were more effective than I'd hoped.

Sam: Your efforts?

Michael: When God left Heaven, I was certain of his return. So I made sure all of the angels and prophets burnished his image on Earth. The all-knowing, all-seeing, all-caring God.

Dean: Daddy's boy.

Jack: And now? After seeing what Chuck's done?

Dean: We reached out to you. You ignored us.

Michael: That was then. This is now. Tell me what you need me to do.


Act Three
Int. Bunker War Room.


Sam: Alright, Michael. Here's the book we've been telling you about.

Michael: That's one of Death's books.

Dean: Yeah, but this one is about God. And how to kill him.

Sam: As far as we know, only Death can open it. But, um... we're hoping, uh... maybe you can, too.

Michael (tries and fails to open the book): I'm sorry.


Int. The Bunker Kitchen.


Sam: So, where does this leave us? We need that book open, and we're out of options. Where's it leave us?

Dean: Screwed. I'm sure Chuck's ready to make a move. (Cellphone rings, vibrates. Caller ID says "Cass") What? (Beep) Cas?

Castiel: Dean. I'm here. (Groans) I'm hurt. Can you let me in?


Sam and Dean rush to the Bunker door and open it to find – Lucifer!


Lucifer: Wazzup?!


Dean slams the door. Lucifer materializes inside the Bunker.


Lucifer: Wow! Way to treat a pal.

Sam: No, you're not our "pal."

Lucifer: Okay, be honest with me, please. Would you have let me in if I said it was really me?

Dean: You're dead. Uh... yeah, not so much.

Lucifer: Um, after pop nutted out and murdered pretty much everyone in the world, the Empty booted me with orders to find the missing God Book and use it on Chuck. Uh, normally, I'm not very good at following orders, as you guys know, but, uh, you do not want to mess with the Empty, man. Total "B," especially after Jack blew up all over her, and she killed Death. (Chuckling) I mean, guys, never a dull moment. But that's the past. What's up?! We're a team again, guys.

Dean: Oh, that is not happening.

Lucifer: Mm. Yeah. Alright, team. I don't want to bring ants to your picnic, but that ain't gonna cut it. Okay, think about it. If the Empty pulled me off the bench, it's 'cause the Winchester charm ain't enough, right? And I did anticipate a little bit of pushback, so I did bring a token of good faith. Voilà.


A woman – bound and gaged – materializes.


Dean: Who is she?

Lucifer: Oh, this is Betty. Betty... Betty, say hi. (Muffled) No, no, no. Say hi to the boys. (Chuckling) Just getting it straight. Oh, did I mention Betty is a reaper? I'm doing a fly-by, right? Okay. I'll say that again. Betty is a reaper.

Sam: Yes, we heard you. So what?

Lucifer: Watch.


Lucifer stabs Betty with an angel blade and she falls to the floor.


Dean: Wow! Really?! Great.

Lucifer: Oh, no, this is... This is the first reaper to check out since Billie, right? So... wait for it. Wait for it. (Betty gets to her knees) Ohhh... And... Meet the new Death.


Dean ungags here, and she headbutts him.


Lucifer: Wow.

Sam: You okay?

Dean: (Spits) Yeah.


A scythe appears in Betty's hand.


Lucifer: Wow. Look at that. I mean, she's got the whole Death starter kit going with the decoder ring. Isn't that awesome? And that, whatever that is. Yeah. I'm good, right?

Betty: So, do you have it? The book. Hand over the book. Wow. Slower than they look.

Lucifer: Yeah.

Betty: Okay, the end of God is in the special book, and if you give Betty the book, Betty can read it. Understand?


Sam and Dean take Betty to the room where God's Book is.


Betty: Uh... not a group project. (She closes the door on them).


Int. Library. Michael appears


Lucifer: Wow. Look at you, bro. The almost-mighty.

Lucifer knocks over a house of cards he has glued together.

Lucifer: Hmm. I cheated.


Sam and Dean enter.


Michael: Are you seriously thinking about trusting him?

Dean: Uh, I wouldn't exactly say "trust."

Lucifer: Mikey, Mikey, come on, man. I get the bitterness. For all you did for the old man, you got no better from him than me. The son voted Most Likely to Suck, and that sucks.

Michael: I did what I did because it was the right thing to do, not to get his love.

Lucifer: Alright, well, that's a good thing, 'cause the man had no love to give... Not to you, not to me, not to... humanity. You see that now, right?

Betty: (Clears throat) Asshats. I have opened the book. And? And it's in here... all that you want. I know how God ends.

Sam: Wait a second. You're sure about this?

Betty: Of course I'm sure. I'm Death.

Dean: You've been Death for an hour.

Betty: "Behold, in the end, there is the ending of he who created the beginning."

Lucifer: Fascinating.

Betty: "And, thus, it will be..."


Lucifer snaps his fingers. The book flies to him and Betty aka Death, disintegrates.


Lucifer: Yeah, this is what Pop wanted to get his hands on. Hmm. Did I say that out loud? Yeah, Pop was the one who let me out of the Empty. I'm sort of the new favorite now. What did Dad say about you? Oh, yeah. "Mikey's a cuck." (Laughs) You're a cuck. (Sam and Dean advance and Lucifer uses his power to throw them against a wall.) Nope. Michael advances on Lucifer.

Lucifer: D'oh!


Lucifer materialises on the other side of the room.


Lucifer Wow, you are really getting rusty at this, buddy. Bye.


Lucifer fires a ball of energy at Michael knocking him down.


Lucifer (to Jack): So... buddy... you're gonna have to make a decision now. Uh, dump the losers and join Gramps and me on the winning team. (Imitates crowd cheering) Of course, this is the only way you're getting out of here alive, 'cause you're not strong enough to fight me now, so... What do you say, kid? What do you say? Come on. Somebody's behind me?

Michael: You don't learn. (He stabs Lucifer with an archangel blade)

Michael: Thanks for the blade.


Int Kitchen.


Dean: How you doing? You okay? (Dean gets a beer from the fridge).

Michael: Yeah, a bit winded. I haven't been in a battle like that for several centuries.

Dean: Yeah, well... glad you were here. Chuck's getting desperate. He knows something's up. Wouldn't take the chance of showing up himself.

Michael: Yes. He sent Lucifer. Brought him back from the dead. He didn't even reach out to me.

Dean: Did you want him to? Of course not. I mean, he clearly he knows the God Book could be lethal to him. But it's actually fairly useless without Death to read it.

Dean: Yeah, well... at least it's open. Sam thought that he recognized some of the symbols in the writing, thought they might be some form of Enochian. So he's gonna use the Book of the Damned, see if he can't figure out the end. And by that, I mean... the end.


Int. Library.


Dean and Jack are researching. Michael enters.


Michael: How's, uh, Sam doing? Any progress?

Dean: I hope so. He's been in there a long time. (Sam enters) Oh. Why don't you ask him yourself.

Sam: Sorry. It's slow going. But I think I was able to piece it together.

Michael: "It"?

Sam: The spell. There's a spell. It has to be done at a particular place... at an exact angle from the sun. But it will release an unstoppable force that will find Chuck... and finish him.

Act Four
Ext. Lake. The Impala arrives at a lake. The ingredients for the spell are prepared in three bronze bowls. Sam, Dean, Jack and Michael stand in a circle around them.

Dean: Let's light it up.


Sam throws a match to the ingredients and three spires of light shoot into the sky.


Dean: Wait. What happened? What's wrong?


Chuck appears. Using his power he tosses Sam, Dean and Jack aside.

Michael: Father.

Chuck: Son. And, listen, I appreciate the heads-up about all this.

Michael: It's always been my destiny to serve you.

Chuck: Yeah. The thing is, it's kind of late in the game. You did side with the Winchesters. I can't forgive that.

Michael: Father, no. That was a lapse of judgment, I admit, but I swear I...

Chuck: Save it! (Chuck uses his power to destroy Michael.)


Sam and Dean get up.


Chuck: And you two. You know, eternal suffering sounds good on paper, but as a viewing experience, it's just kind of... eh. So we're done. I'm canceling your show.

Sam: Alright. Well... one for the road. (Sam hits Chuck) Cute. (Chuck uses his power to hurt Sam and Dean) Eh, what the heck. I can get my hands dirty. (Chuck starts beating Sam and Dean). Fellas, give it up now.

Chuck keeps beating the boys. Bones snap. They are bloodied and badly beaten. They still get up.

Chuck: Come on, guys. Just stay down. (Chuck hits them again and again). That's enough, guys. Guys, come on.


Chuck keeps punching them.


Just stay down.


Sam and Dean keep getting up, only to be knocked down again.


Fellas, give it up.


Chuck knocks them down yet again.


That's enough, guys. Guys, come on. That's enough.


Sam and Dean help each other up. They can barely stand, but they are laughing.


Chuck: Why are you smiling?

Sam: Because. You lose. (Sam gestures towards Jack)

Chuck: Hey, Jack.


Chuck snaps his fingers but nothing happens. Jack walks up to him and places his hands on the sides of Chuck's head. All Chuck's power transfers to Jack. With a snap of his fingers, he heals Sam and Dean.


Chuck: What... What did you do?

Dean: We won.

Chuck: So this is how it ends. My book.

Sam: See for yourself.


He throws God.s book to him. Chuck flicks through the pages which appear blank.


Chuck: There's nothing there.

Sam: Oh, there is. But only Death can read it.

Dean: That's right. So we had to come up with a plan "B." That wasn't too hard, though, when we realized that Michael really is a daddy's boy.


Flashback to Lucifer "Oh, yeah. "Mikey's a cuck.""

Dean: See, he didn't take it too well when he found out that you asked Lucifer for help. Oh, he was desperate to be the favorite again.

Sam: Since we couldn't read the book, we had to come up with a story about finding the spell, which we knew Michael would feed straight to you.

Dean: All that prep work we did to turn Jack here into a cosmic bomb? Oh. Well, it turned him into sort of a power vacuum. He's been sucking up bits of power all over the place.


Flashback to Jack walking past plants, causing them to die.


Dean: So when the two heavyweights... Your boys... Showed up to duke it out, ohh.


Flashback to Michael and Lucifer using their power against each other, and Michael killing Lucifer.


Dean: That charged him right up.

Sam: See, we knew Michael would warn you and you'd show up here. And you did. And you killed your own son.

Dean: And you beat the crap out of us. Releasing all kinds of power. God power. Jack absorbed it all. It made him...

Dean: Well, it made him unstoppable.

Chuck: This... This... This is why you're my favorites. You know, for the first time, I have no idea what happens next. Is this where you kill me? I mean, I could never think of an ending where I lose. But this, after everything that I've done to you... to die at the hands of Sam Winchester... Of Dean Winchester, the ultimate killer... It's kind of glorious.

Dean: Sorry, Chuck.

Chuck: What? What?

Dean: See, that's not who I am. That's not who we are.

Chuck: What kind of an ending is this?

Sam: His power. You sure it won't come back?

Jack: It's not his power anymore.

Sam: Then I think it's the ending where you're just like us and like all the other humans you forgot about.

Dean: It's the ending where you grow old, you get sick, and you just die.

Sam: And no one cares. And no one remembers you. You're just forgotten.

Chuck: Guys... Guys... wait.

Sam, Dean and Jack get into the Impala and drive off.

Chuck: Guys... Guys! No, wait. G-Guys... Guys, wait! Guys, wait! Guys, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Please wait! Guys!

Act Five
Ext. Hastings, Minnesota. Sam, Dean and Jack get out of the Impala.


Dean: Alright, kid, you really think you can pull this off?


Jack closes his eyes. We shots of deserted places around the world... and suddenly the people re-appear.


Dean: Way to go.

Sam: So... does this mean you're the new... I mean, what do we call you?

Dean: Who cares what we call him? Look, all that matters is he got us back online.

Sam: Hey, what happened to Amara when Chuck...

Jack: She's with me. We're in harmony.

Sam: You gonna come back with us to the bunker?

Dean: What do you mean? Of course he's gonna come back to the bunker. He's the man with the plan. He's top dog. He can do whatever he wants now. Come on. You know what? We'll spruce the place up. We'll get some recliners. We'll get you one of those big-screen TVs.

Jack: Dean, I'm not coming back home. In a way... I'm already there.

Dean: Where?

Jack: Everywhere.

Sam: So you are Him.

Jack: I'm me. But I know what you mean.

Sam: What if we want to see you? You know, or have a beer or whatever?

Jack: I'm around. I'll be in every drop of falling rain, every speck of dust that the wind blows, and in the sand, in the rocks, and the sea.

Dean: It's a hell of a time to bail. You got a lot of people counting on you, people with questions. They're gonna need answers.

Jack: And those answers will be in each of them. Maybe not today, but... someday. People don't need to pray to me or to sacrifice to me. They just need to know that I'm already a part of them and to trust in that. I won't be hands on. Chuck put himself in the story. That was his mistake. But I learned from you and my mother and Castiel that... when people have to be their best... they can be. And that's what to believe in.

Well... I'm really as close as this. (Jack puts his hand over his heart). Goodbye.


Jack walks off and disappears.


Sam: See ya, Jack.


Int. Bunker. Library. Sam and dean sit on the library table – each with a beer.


Sam: It's pretty quiet.

Dean: Mm-hmm. To everyone that we lost along the way.

Sam: You know, with Chuck not writing our story anymore, we get to write our own. You know, just you and me going wherever the story takes us. Just us.

Dean: Finally, free.


Sam and Dean get up. On the table Castiel and Jack's names have neem carved in, added to Dean, Sam and Mary's initials.


THE END.
