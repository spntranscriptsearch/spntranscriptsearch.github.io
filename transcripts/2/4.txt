TEASER
NEIL
Okay. We've got booze, we've got chocolate, and, wait for it... tortured emo rock. Guaranteed cure for any broken heart.

ANGELA
You didn't have to do all this. I'm fine.

NEIL
Yeah, I can see that.

She takes his hand in both of hers.

ANGELA
Thanks, Neil.

NEIL
Yeah.

There is a loud pounding at the door. They both look around.

NEIL
Look...

ANGELA
It's probably him.

NEIL
I'll take care of it.

He goes to the front door, opens it. MATT is standing there.

MATT
Where is she?

NEIL
Let's just chill out and think about this for a second, okay?

MATT
I need to talk to her.

NEIL
Some other time.

MATT
You get out of my face, Neil.

MATT shoves NEIL and enters; NEIL shuts the door behind him. They both go into the kitchen to find ANGELA gone.



EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

ANGELA is driving down a dark road, crying. Her cell phone rings, and the display reads "Matt Cell Phone Calling". She picks up.

ANGELA
Leave. Me. Alone.

MATT (on phone)
Angela, I'm sorry.

ANGELA
You're sorry? (laughs) You're sorry, oh, that's great.

MATT
Angela, listen to me.

ANGELA
I don't want to listen to you! I'm done listening!

MATT
Listen to me!

ANGELA
No - I... I love you!

Crying and looking down, she doesn't see a turn in the road. She crashes into the barrier.

MATT
Angela? Angela?

Close on ANGELA'S face, staring, covered in blood.

TITLE CARD:
SUPERNATURAL



EXT. ROAD - DAY

The Impala zooms down a two-lane blacktop. DEAN is driving, SAM in the passenger's seat.

DEAN
Come on, Sam, I'm begging you. This is stupid.

SAM
Why?

DEAN
Going to visit Mom's grave? She doesn't even have a grave -- there, there was no body left after the fire.

SAM
She has a headstone.

DEAN
Yeah, put up by her uncle, a man we've never even met. So you wanna, go pay your respects to a slab of granite put up by a stranger? Come on.

SAM
Dean, that's not the point.

DEAN
Well then, enlighten me, Sam.

SAM
It's not about a body, or, or, a casket. It's about her memory, okay?

DEAN
Hmmm.

SAM
And after Dad it just... just feels like the right thing to do.

DEAN
It's irrational, is what it is.

SAM
Look, man. No one asked you to come.

DEAN
Why don't we swing by the roadhouse instead? I mean, we haven't heard anything on the demon lately. We should be hunting that son of a bitch down.

SAM
That's a good idea, you should. Just drop me off, I'll hitch a ride, and I'll meet you there tomorrow.

DEAN
Right. (Heh) Stuck ... stuck with those people, making awkward small talk until you show up? No thanks.



EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

SAM kneels before a headstone, digging in the ground with a folding knife. The headstone reads: MARY WINCHESTER, 1954-1983, In Loving Memory

SUBTITLE:
CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS

SAM pulls a set of dogtags out of his pocket. He sighs.

SAM
I think, um .... I think Dad would have wanted you to have these.
(He drops the dogtags in the hole and covers them.)
I love you, Mom.

Nearby, DEAN is standing by another gravestone, marked as "Loving Father", looking pensive. He sees a dying tree, and stops, frowning. He walks over to it, knocks on the trunk, consideringly, then notices a perfect circle of dead grass surrounding a gravestone. He crouches down, fingering dead flowers.

LATER, DEAN takes a card from a man in a suit, then walks over to SAM.

DEAN
Angela Mason. She was a student at the local college; funeral was three days ago.

The boys walk together.

SAM
And?

DEAN
And? You saw her grave. Everything dead around it, in a perfect circle? You don't think that's a little weird?

SAM
Maybe the groundskeeper went a little agro with the pesticide.

DEAN
No, I asked him, I asked him. No pesticide, no chemicals. Nobody can explain it.

SAM
Okay, so what are you thinking?

DEAN
I dunno. Unholy ground, maybe?

SAM
Un-- (stops, speechless)

DEAN
What? If something evil happened there, it could easily poison the ground. Remember the, the farm outside of Cedar Rapids?

SAM
Yeah, b-

DEAN
Could be the sign of a demonic presence. Or the, the Angela girl's spirit, if it's powerful enough.
(SAM nods, turning away.)
Well, don't get too excited, you might pull something.

SAM
It's just... stumbling onto a hunt? Here, of all places?

DEAN
So?

SAM
So -- are you sure this is about a hunt, and not about something else?

DEAN
What else would it be about?

SAM (sighs heavily, shaking his head, moves to get into the car)
You know, just forget about it.

DEAN
You believe what you want, Sam, but -- I let you drag my ass out here, the least we could do is check this out.

SAM
Yeah. Fine.

DEAN
Girl's dad works in town. He's a professor at the school.



INT. SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

DEAN and SAM knock on the door of DR. MASON'S office.

DEAN
Dr. Mason?

DR. MASON
Yes?

SAM
I'm Sam. This is Dean. We were friends of Angela's. We ... we wanted to offer our condolences.

DR. MASON
Please, come in.

They enter; he closes the door behind them. Sitting down, he shows them a photo album. In the corner, DEAN is looking through an old book.

SAM (looking at the photo album with DR MASON)
She was beautiful.

DR. MASON
Yes, she was.

DEAN (standing nearby, looking at a bookshelf)
This is an unusual book.

He shows the cover of the book he's been paging through; it has carvings of Greek letters and a triangular symbol.

DR. MASON
It's ancient Greek; I teach a course.

DEAN
So a car accident, that's, that's horrible.

DR. MASON
Angie was only a mile away from home when, uh ...

DEAN
It's gotta be hard. Losing someone like that. Sometimes it's like they're s-- still around. Almost like you can still sense their presence.
(SAM looks at him, concerned.)
You ever feel anything like that?

DR. MASON
I do, as a matter of fact.

SAM
(still looking at DEAN)
That's perfectly normal, Dr. Mason. Especially with what you're going through.

DR. MASON
You know, I still phone her. And the phone's ringing before I remember that, uh .... Family's everything, you know? Angie was the most important thing in my life. And now I, I, I'm just lost without her.

SAM
We're very sorry.



INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN
I'm telling you, there's something going on here. We just haven't found it yet.

SAM
Dean, so far you've got a patch of dead grass and nothing.

DEAN
Well, something turned that grave into unholy ground.

SAM
There's no reason for it to be unholy ground. Angela Mason was a nice girl who died in a car crash. That's not exactly vengeful spirit material. You heard her father.

DEAN
Yeah, well, maybe Daddy doesn't know everything there is to know about his little angel, huh?

SAM
You know what? We never should have bothered that poor man. We shouldn't even be here anymore.

DEAN
So what, Sam? What, we just bail? Without even figuring out what's going on?

SAM
I think I know what's going on here. It's the only reason I went along with you this far.

DEAN
What are you talking about?

SAM
This is about Mom's grave.

DEAN
(scoffs)
That's got nothing to do with it.

SAM
You wouldn't step within a hundred yards of it. Look. Maybe you're imagining a hunt where there isn't one so you don't have to think about Mom. Or Dad.
(Dean turns to look at him.)
(Sam sighs.)
You wanna take another swing? Go ahead, if it'll make you feel better.

DEAN (shakes his head minutely)
I don't need this crap.

DEAN grabs his jacket and keys and starts for the door.

SAM
Dean, where're you going?

DEAN
I'm going to go get a drink. Alone.

He leaves. Cut to:



INT. MATT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

MATT is sitting alone in his living room, watching home movies of him and Angela. He gets up to get a beer. Close shot of a small plant on the side table; it withers. MATT sits back down again, without noticing the plant. He pauses the tape; freezes it on Angela's face; then he sees ANGELA'S reflection in the screen and turns around, startled. He screams, and blood splashes the screen.

END ACT ONE


ACT TWO
INT. ANGELA'S HOUSE - DAY

DEAN entering an apartment (ANGELA'S home). He looks around, picks up a framed picture. He glimpses a figure in reflection just before she sees him - it's the roommate, LINDSEY.

LINDSEY
Who the hell are you?

She turns and shuts herself in her bedroom.

DEAN
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on!

LINDSEY
I'm calling 9-1-1!

DEAN
I'm Angela's cousin!

LINDSEY
What?

DEAN
Yeah, her dad sent me over to, uh, pick up her stuff, my name's Alan? Alan Stanwick?

LINDSEY
(opening the door)
Her dad didn't say that you were coming.

DEAN
Well, I mean,
(holding up a set of keys)
How else would I the key to your place? (He laughs reassuringly and a bit uncomfortably.)



INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

DEAN hands the girl a kleenex. She's crying, and DEAN looks slightly uncomfortable.

DEAN
So. I'm sure you got a, a view of Angela that none of the family got to see. Tell me, what, what was she like? I mean, what was she really like?

LINDSEY
She was great.

DEAN
Hmm.

LINDSEY
Just great. I mean, she was so... so...

DEAN
Great.

LINDSEY
Yeah. Yeah. (sobbing again)

DEAN
Yeah.
(hands her another tissue)
Here you go. You two must have been really close, huh?

LINDSEY
We were. But it's not just her, it's Matt.

DEAN
Who?

LINDSEY
Angela's boyfriend.

DEAN
Right, Matt. What about him?

LINDSEY
He killed himself last night. He cut his own throat. Who does that?

DEAN
That's -- terrible.

LINDSEY
He was taking Angela's death pretty hard, and I guess... I mean, he'd been messed up about it for days.

DEAN
Messed up how?

LINDSEY
He kept saying that he saw her everywhere.

DEAN
Well, I'm, I'm sure that that's normal, I mean with everything that he was going through.

LINDSEY
No, he said that he SAW her. As in, an acid trip or something.

DEAN
Were Angela and Matt a happy couple? I mean, is there any reason that Angela would be angry with him?

LINDSEY
What? No, of course not, why do you ask?

DEAN
Just asking. Where did Matt live?



INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

SAM is sitting on the edge of the bed, watching television.

TV ANNOUNCER
Next, on the Skin channel, Casa Erotica Four. A tale of two Latin beauties ...

DEAN opens the door, and SAM looks around, startled. He shuts off the TV and tosses down the remote.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN enters slowly, glancing between the television and Sam.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Awkward.

SAM
Where in the hell were you?

DEAN
Working my imaginary case.

SAM
Yeah? And?

DEAN
Well, you were right, I didn't find much.
(SAM nods, sympathetic)
Yeah. Except Angela's boyfriend died last night. Slit his own throat. But, you know, that's normal. Uh, let's see, what else. Oh, he was seeing Angela everywhere before he died. But you know, I'm sure that's just me transferring my own feelings.

SAM
Okay, I get it. I'm sorry, maybe there is something going on here.

DEAN
Maybe? Sam, I know how to do my job, despite what you might think.

SAM
We should check out the guy's apartment.

DEAN
I just came from there. Pile of dead plants, just like the cemetery. Hell, dead goldfish too.
SAM
So, unholy ground?

DEAN
Maybe. I'm still not getting that powerful angry spirit vibe from Angela.
(He gets up, crosses the room to pick up a pink book.)
I have been reading this, though.

SAM
You stole the girl's diary?

DEAN
Yeah, Sam. And if anything the girl's a little too nice.

SAM
So what do you want to do?

DEAN
Keep digging, talk to more of her friends.

SAM
You get any names?

DEAN
Are you kidding me? I have her bestest friend in the whole wide world. (Holding the diary.)



EXT. NEIL'S HOUSE - DAY

NEIL
I didn't realize the college employed grief counselors.

DEAN
Oh yeah. Yeah, you talk, we listen. Or maybe throw in a little therapeutic collage, whatever jump-starts the healing.

NEIL
Well, I think I'm okay. Thanks.

SAM
Well, you heard what happened to Matt Harrison, right?

NEIL
Yeah, I did.

SAM
Well, we just wanted to make sure you were okay. Grief can make people do crazy things.

NEIL
Look, I'm sorry about what happened to him. I am. But if Matt killed himself it wasn't 'cause of grief.

DEAN
No? Then why?

NEIL
It was guilt. Angie's death was Matt's fault and he knew it.

SAM
How was Matt responsible?

NEIL
Well, she really loved that guy. But the night of the accident she walked in on him with another girl.

DEAN
Hmm.

NEIL
She was really torn up, that's why she crashed the car. Um, look, I gotta get ready for work, so ... thanks for the concern, but... seriously, I'll be okay.

DEAN turns and looks significantly at SAM.



EXT. STREET - DAY

DEAN and SAM walk away from the house.

DEAN
Well, that vengeful spirit theory's starting to make a little more sense. I mean, hell hath no fury...

SAM
So if Angela got her revenge on Matt, you think it's over?

DEAN
Well, there's one way to be sure.

They get in the car.

SAM
Yeah? What's that?

DEAN
Burn the bones.

SAM
Burn the bones? (Sam scoffs.) Are you high?
(DEAN thinks about that.)
Angela died last week!

DEAN
So?

SAM
So, there's not gonna be bones. There's gonna be a ripe, rotting body in the coffin.

DEAN
Since when are you afraid to get dirty? Huh?



EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM dig at ANGELA'S gravesite. They're panting and sweating with exertion. Standing on the coffin, DEAN clears the rest of the dirt off and turns to SAM.

DEAN
Ladies first.

SAM
(handing DEAN his flashlight)
Hold that.

SAM opens the coffin, wincing in preparation -- but the coffin is empty. They look at each other.



INT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

NEIL goes down to the basement to find ANGELA waiting for him. She is pale. She turns and smiles at him.

ANGELA
I missed you.

She crosses the room and kisses him. He kisses her back.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are still in the freshly dug grave, staring at ANGELA'S empty coffin.

DEAN
They buried the body four days ago.

SAM
I don't get it.
(In the light of the flashlight he sees something carved into the inside of the coffin.)
Look.

DEAN
What is that?

SAM
I'm not sure.

DEAN
I've seen these kind of symbols before.



EXT. DR. MASON'S OFFICE - DAY

DEAN pounds heavily on the door. He's very agitated.

SAM
Dean. Take it easy, okay?

DR. MASON opens the door.

DR. MASON
You're Angie's friends, right?

SAM
(gently)
Dr. Mason...

DEAN
(harshly)
We need to talk.

DR. MASON
Well, then, come in.

SAM
Thanks.



INT. DR. MASON'S OFFICE - DAY

DEAN
You teach Ancient Greek. Tell me -- (unwrapping paper) what are these?

He shows DR. MASON the paper on which he's copied the symbols from the grave.

DR. MASON
I don't understand. You said this had something to do with Angela.

DEAN
It does. Please, just humor me.

DR. MASON
They're part of an ancient Greek divination ritual.

DEAN
Used for necromancy, right?

DR. MASON
That's right.

DEAN
See, before we came over here we stopped by the library and did a little homework ourselves. Apparently they used rituals like this one for communicating with the dead. Even bringing corpses back to life. Full-on zombie action.

DR. MASON
Yes. I mean, according to the legends. Now, what's all this about?

SAM, watching DR. MASON'S face, is having doubts. DEAN pushes on.

DEAN
I think you know.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN
Look, I get it. Okay? There are people that I would give anything to see again. But what gives you the right?

SAM
Dean!

DR. MASON
What are you talking about?

DEAN
What's dead should stay dead!

DR. MASON
What?!

SAM
Stop it!

DEAN
What you brought back isn't even your daughter anymore. These things are vicious, they're violent, they're so nasty they rot the ground around them. I mean, come on, haven't you seen Pet Sematary?

DR. MASON
You're insane.

DEAN
Where is she?

DR. MASON
Get out of my house.

He starts dialing the phone; DEAN knocks it out of his hand.

DEAN
I know you're hiding her somewhere. Where is she?!

SAM
Dean! Stop, that's enough! Dean, look!
(He grabs Dean's jacket, points to a row of plants by the window.)
Beautiful, living plants.
(to Dr. Mason)
We're leaving.

DR. MASON
I'm calling the police.

DEAN pulls out of SAM's grip and storms for the door.

SAM
Sir, we're sorry. We won't bother you again.
(They leave)



EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

DEAN strides down the steps and along the sidewalk, SAM following.

SAM
What the hell is the matter with you, Dean?

DEAN
Back off.

SAM
That man is innocent! He didn't deserve that!

DEAN
Okay, so she's not here, maybe he's keeping her somewhere else.

SAM
Stop it! That's enough, okay? Enough!

DEAN
Sam, I know what I'm doing.

SAM
No, you don't. At all. Dean, I don't scare easy, but man, you're scaring the crap out of me.

DEAN
Don't be overdramatic, Sam.

SAM
You're lucky this turned out to be a real case. Because if it wasn't you would have just found something else to kill.

DEAN
Wha-

SAM
You're on edge, you're erratic - except for when you're hunting, because then you're downright scary. You're tailspinning, man. And you refuse to talk about it and you won't let me help you.

DEAN
I can take care of myself, thanks.

SAM
No, you can't. And you know what? You're the only one who thinks you should have to. You don't have to handle this on your own, Dean, no one can.

DEAN
(overlap)
Sam, if you bring up Dad's death one more time I swear...

SAM
(overlap)
Stop. Please, Dean, it's killing you. Please. We've already lost Dad. We've lost Mom. I've lost Jessica. And now I'm going to lose you too?

DEAN
We better get out of here before the cops come.
(Sam frowns at him.)
I hear you. Okay? Yeah, I'm being an ass. And I'm sorry. But right now we've got a friggin' zombie running around, and we need to figure out how to kill it.
(SAM laughs.)
Right?

SAM
Our lives are weird, man.

DEAN
You're telling me? Come on.



INT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ANGELA is sitting on NEIL'S couch, NEIL is standing nearby.

ANGELA
Honey, is something bothering you?

NEIL
It's about Matt.

ANGELA
Haven't we already talked about that?

NEIL
I know, but uh...

ANGELA
Haven't we wasted enough time on him already? Come sit down.
(he does)
You always said that he didn't deserve me. You were right.

NEIL
Angela, you didn't get out, and go see Matt, or...

ANGELA
I've been here the whole time. Neil. You really think I could do something like that?

NEIL
No. I don't know. I can't help it, you just, you seem -

ANGELA
Different? You're right. I am. I've realized you're the only one who ever really loved me. You proved that. You brought me back. I'm with you now. Isn't that what you always wanted?



INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

DEAN is pacing, SAM sitting on the bed with John's journal.

DEAN
We can't just waste it with a head shot?

SAM
Dude. You've been watching way too many Romero flicks.

DEAN
You're telling me there's no lore on how to smoke 'em.

He goes to sit at the table by the window.

SAM
No, Dean, I'm telling you there's too much. I mean, there's a hundred different legends on the walking dead, but they all have different methods for killing them.
(He joins DEAN at the table)
Some say -- setting them on fire, uh, one said, where is it? Right here. Feeding their hearts to wild dogs. That's my personal favorite. I mean, who knows what's real and what's myth?

DEAN
Is there anything they all have in common?

SAM
No. But a few said silver might work.

DEAN
Silver's a start.

SAM
Yeah. But now how are we going to find Angela?

DEAN
We've got to figure out the person who brought her back.

SAM
Any ideas?

DEAN
I think if it's not her dad it might be that guy Neil.

SAM
Neil?

DEAN
Yep.

DEAN stands and crosses the room to pick up the pink diary.

SAM
How'd you come up with that?

DEAN
Well, you've got your journal, I've got mine.
(reading from the diary)
"Neil's a real shoulder to cry on, he so understands what I'm going through with Matt." There's more in here where that came from. It's got unrequited Duckie love written all over it.

SAM
Yeah, but that doesn't mean he brought her back from the dead.

DEAN
Hmm. Did I mention he's Professor Mason's TA? Has access to all the same books.


SAM looks speculative.


INT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM break in; the house is dark and quiet.

DEAN
Hello? Neil?! It's your grief counselors -- we've come to hug.

He pulls out a gun. SAM looks at it.

SAM
Silver bullets?

DEAN
Yeah, enough to make her rattle like a change purse.

They start stalking through the house, DEAN in the lead with the gun out. They see wilted plants by a window. They find the entrance to the basement. DEAN nods at it.

DEAN
Unless it's where he keeps his porn...

SAM opens the door and DEAN leads the way down the stairs to the room we saw earlier. It is empty.

DEAN
Sure looks like a zombie pen to me.

SAM
Yeah. An empty one. You think Angela's going after somebody?

DEAN finds a loose grate and pulls it aside -- it leads out, somewhere.

DEAN
Nah, I think she went out to rent Beaches.

SAM
Look, smartass, she might kill someone. We gotta find her, Dean.

DEAN
Yeah. All right. She, uh, she clipped Matt because he was cheating, right?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Well, it takes two to, you know, have hardcore sex.
(SAM shakes his head at him.)
I don't know, it just seemed that, uh, Angela's roommate was broken up over Matt's death. I mean, like, really broken up.



INT. ANGELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

LINDSEY is sitting in the dim house looking at a framed picture of MATT and ANGELA. She hears a noise, gets up and goes to the front door.

LINDSEY
Hello? (She's nervous.)

She opens the door, sees nothing. She turns, and ANGELA is there. ANGELA grabs her by the hair; LINDSEY screams.

ANGELA
Hi Lindsey, I'm home!

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. ANGELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

LINDSEY breaks away from ANGELA, screaming. She runs into the kitchen; following, ANGELA picks up a pair of scissors from the counter.

ANGELA
You know what you did!

LINDSEY
I'm sorry. I am so, so --

ANGELA
You're not sorry enough!

ANGELA stabs with the scissors; LINDSEY ducks. ANGELA attacks again and LINDSEY goes down to the floor. As ANGELA advances, LINDSEY kicks out, knocking ANGELA forward onto the scissors. She goes still. LINDSEY gets up, cautiously shoves ANGELA'S body over. The scissors are sticking out of her chest.

LINDSEY
Oh God. Oh god. Oh my god. Oh my god, oh, oh --

ANGELA'S eyes open; she grabs LINDSEY by the hair and pulls the scissors out. As she pulls them both to standing, readying the scissors to stab LINDSEY, several shots are fired and ANGELA convulses. Pan around to reveal DEAN and SAM, just entering; DEAN fires the gun again, right in ANGELA'S chest. She screams and bolts out the window; DEAN follows. SAM runs to LINDSEY.

SAM
Gotcha. I gotcha.

DEAN comes back through the window.

DEAN
Damn, that dead chick can run.

SAM
What now?

DEAN
I say we go have a little chat with Neil.



EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

DEAN is driving the Impala, SAM in the passenger's seat with the Journal open.

SAM
So the silver bullets, they did something, right?

DEAN
Yeah, something, but not enough. What else you got?

SAM
Um, okay, besides silver, we have ... nailing the undead back into their gravebeds. It's mentioned a few times. It's probably where the whole vampire staking lore came from.

DEAN
Their gravebeds? You serious?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
How the hell are we going to get Angela back to the cemetery?



INT. NEIL'S OFFICE - NIGHT


NEIL is sitting in the dark, nervous. DEAN and SAM enter.

NEIL
What are you guys doing here?

DEAN
You know, I've heard of people doing some pretty desperate things to get laid, but you -- you take the cake.

NEIL
Okay. Who are you guys?

DEAN
You might want to ask Angela that question.

NEIL
What?

SAM
We know what you did. The ritual? Everything.

NEIL (scoffs)
You're crazy.

DEAN
Your girlfriend's past her expiration date and we're crazy? When someone's gone they should stay gone. You don't mess with that kind of stuff.

SAM
Angela killed Matt. She tried to kill Lindsey.

NEIL
I don't know what you're talking about.

DEAN stomps over to the other side of the desk and hauls NEIL up by the collar.

DEAN
Hey! No more crap, Neil. His blood is on your hands. Now. Me and him can make this right, but you've gotta tell us where she is. Tell us!

NEIL
My house. She's at my house.

DEAN lets him go, then sees several potted plants by the window. They're dead. He looks at NEIL.

DEAN
You sure about that?

NEIL nods, looking around nervously. DEAN looks past him to see a closet. Thinking, he seems to get an idea. He raises his voice slightly.

DEAN
Listen. It doesn't really matter where she is. There's only one way to stop her. We've got to perform another ritual over her grave, to reverse the one that you did. We're going to need some black root, some, some scar weed, some candles... It's very complicated, but it'll get the job done. She'll be dead again in a couple hours. I think you should come with us.
(Significantly)
I'm serious, Neil. Leave with us. Right now.

NEIL
No. No.

DEAN leans in, lowering his voice again.

DEAN
Listen to me. Get out of here as soon as you can. But most of all, be cool. No sudden movements. Don't make her mad.
(to SAM)
Let's go.

Swallowing hard, NEIL goes to the closet and opens it. ANGELA is there.

NEIL
You said you'd stay in the house.

ANGELA
Sorry. I just needed to see you. Neil, please. You have to help me.

She lowers her arms to show the stab and bullet wounds. He cringes.

NEIL
Oh, god.

ANGELA
Come with me to the cemetery. Neil, they're trying to kill me. We have to stop them.

NEIL
You mean kill them.
(She nods.)
It's true. Matt and Lindsey.

ANGELA
They hurt me! If you love me you'll make sure nobody hurts me again. Take me to the cemetery. And then all this will be over. We can start new lives, together.

NEIL
(nodding)
Okay. God help me, but okay. I'll go get the car. Just, just wait here.

He leaves. He makes it down to:



EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

At his car, NEIL is panting . He drops the keys when he tries to open the car; as he stands, ANGELA is there.

ANGELA
Neil, you look nervous.

NEIL (trembling)
No, I'm, I'm fine.

ANGELA
Were you going to leave me?

NEIL
No, of course not.

ANGELA
You were, weren't you?! How could you? Neil, I loved you!

NEIL
Angela -

She grabs his head and wrenches it; with a crunch, his neck breaks and he falls to the ground dead.



EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Around ANGELA'S grave, DEAN and SAM are lighting candles.

SAM
You really think this is going to work?

DEAN
No, not really. But it was the only thing I could come up with.

They hear a noise, nod to each other. SAM stands and pulls a gun from the small of his back. He stalks in the direction of the sound. Some distance away, he freezes, hearing something behind him. ANGELA advances towards him. He turns at the last minute, and points the gun at ANGELA; she stops short.

ANGELA
Wait! It's not what you think. I didn't ask to be brought back. But it's still me. I'm still a person. Please.

After hearing her out, SAM fires the gun, hitting her square in the forehead. She screams, her head snapping back. Then he bolts back towards the grave. She tackles him, and he lands hard on the ground; she twists his head back. DEAN fires at her, startling her back to standing. He shoots her several more times until she falls straight back into the open grave, landing in the empty coffin. DEAN grabs a long metal stake (sword?) and runs to the grave, sliding the last length on his knees and diving into the coffin. He buries the stake in her chest, pinning her in.

ANGELA screams
Wait, don't --!!!!

DEAN drives it further in. She gasps one last time, then goes limp. DEAN pulls back, panting.

DEAN
What's dead should stay dead.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. GRAVEYARD - MORNING

DEAN and SAM pat down the dirt over the grave. (Panting.)

SAM
Rest in peace.

DEAN
Yeah. For good this time, okay?

They turn away, heading for the car. SAM grunts as he lifts the shovel over one shoulder.

SAM
You know, that whole fake ritual thing, luring Angela into the cemetery? Pretty sharp.

DEAN
Thanks.

SAM
But did we have to use me as bait?

DEAN
I figured you were more her type. You know, she had pretty crappy taste in guys.

SAM
I think she broke my hand.

DEAN
(laughing)
You're just too fragile. We'll get it looked at later.

He turns back to Mary's grave, pausing.

SAM
You want to stay for a while?

DEAN
No.

They drop their things in the trunk of the car and get in, DEAN in the driver's side. They pull out of town to:



EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Driving along, DEAN is scowling. SAM looks at him, concerned. DEAN pulls the car across the road to stop in the opposite shoulder. He gets out and sits on the hood. SAM follows.

SAM
Dean, what is it?

Pause.

DEAN
I'm sorry.

SAM
You -- For what?

DEAN
The way I've been acting.
(SAM crosses to sit on the hood, close but not touching.)
And for Dad. I mean, he was your dad too. And it's my fault that he's gone.

SAM
What are you talking about?

DEAN
I know you've been thinking it -- so have I. Doesn't take a genius to figure it out. Back at the hospital, I made a full recovery. It was a miracle. And five minutes later Dad's dead and the Colt's gone.

SAM
Dean.

DEAN
You can't tell me there's not a connection there. I don't know how the demon was involved. I don't know how the whole thing went down exactly. But Dad's dead because of me. And that much I do know.

SAM
We don't know that. Not for sure.

DEAN
Sam ...
(He starts crying)
You and Dad ... you're the most important people in my life. And now ... I never should've come back, Sam. It wasn't natural. And now look what's come of it. I was dead. And I should have stayed dead. You wanted to know how I was feeling. Well, that's it.
(SAM nods.)
So tell me. What could you possibly say to make that all right?

DEAN turns to look at Sam. Sam looks away. Dean looks away.

Pan out to reveal the two of them, still not quite touching, leaning against the hood of the car on the side of a mountain road.
