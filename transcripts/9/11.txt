TEASER
[Scene opens with the tagline 'Jasper Springs, Mississippi 1863' A confederate soldier rides up to a cabin on a horse and quickly jumps off, tying it to a rail. He bursts into the cabin and there are two other soldiers inside who are guarding a door.]


HORSE RIDING SOLDIER

He's coming! Stand your ground, no matter what happens. The knight must be protected.


[The room starts shaking and the curtains blow around the windows. Suddenly all three of the soldier's eyes turn black and they turn around to see a man in the doorway. The man grabs the first soldier's face and his eyes and mouth burn out in a hot, red light. The other two demons/soldiers shoot the man and he doesn't even react. Suddenly the camera is outside and the windows all glow in the same hot, red light. We are back inside and the man steps over the bodies of the dead demons on the floor. We see him grasping a large jawbone as he kicks in the door to the guarded room.]


TITLE CARD


ACT ONE
[Scene opens in a bar. DEAN, with a few-day-old beard, sits at the bar and watches a pretty waitress hustle by. He smiles sexily after her. CROWLEY appears.]


CROWLEY

So...is that boudoir smile for me?


[DEAN startles and draws the demon knife from his jacket]


CROWLEY

At least buy me a drink first.


DEAN

I said the next time I see you --


CROWLEY

Dead. Yes, rings a bell, but let's not dwell on the past, shall we? This bar is a bust. That waitress is trouble with a capital VD, and your prey, Gadreel, has left the building. So, it's time to move on to more pressing matters, like destroying Abaddon.


DEAN

Yeah, good luck with that. The Knights of Hell aren't exactly the dying kind.


CROWLEY

But there is something that can kill a knight. The weapon that the archangels used to execute them -- The First Blade.


DEAN

Never heard of it. Can I kill you now?


CROWLEY

I've been chasing that blade for decades. The closest I got to it was when one of my droogs -- Smitty -- got wind of a protégé demon of Abaddon's who claimed knowledge of the blade. Sadly, before Smitty

could nab the guy, a hunter by the name of John Winchester nabbed the protégé. I'm here to see if there's anything in the John Winchester memorial library that might lead us to the first blade -- to killing Abaddon.


DEAN

You want to hunt? With me?


CROWLEY

I do love a good buddy comedy.


[DEAN rolls his eyes and reluctantly takes John's journal out of his jacket and lays it on the table. He rummages through the pages until he finds what he's looking for.]


DEAN

Oh, yeah. Here it is. Yeah, he picked up a protégé who had bones with Abaddon, but that's about all it says in here.


CROWLEY

What do those numbers in the margins mean?


DEAN

None of your business.


CROWLEY

You're gonna play hard to get? We have time for a montage?


DEAN

It's a code -- one of my dad's storage lockers. He may have put something about the case there.


CROWLEY

And what does the "T" next to the numbers mean?


DEAN

Not a clue.


CROWLEY

Fine. Let's go find daddy's man cave, then, shall we?


DEAN

And how do I know this isn’t a trap?


CROWLEY

You...don't. That's what makes it fun.


[CROWLEY shoots DEAN a wily grin and heads out the door. DEAN slowly follows. The camera pans to the man sitting next to them at the bar. He watches them leave as his eyes turn black. Then he follows them out the door.]


[Scene changes to a close up of a PB&J sandwich. CASTIEL goes to take a bite as sits in the bunker. The door opens above him.]


CASTIEL [clearly not enjoying the sandwich.]

Mm.


SAM [walking down the stairs]

Hey.


CASTIEL

Tastes like...molecules.


SAM

What? What are you talking about?


CASTIEL

When I was human, you know, I had to eat constantly. It was kind of annoying.


SAM

Yeah, a lot of human things are pretty annoying.


CASTIEL

But...I enjoyed the taste of food -- particularly peanut butter with grape jelly, not jam. Jam I found unsettling.


SAM [sitting on the table next to CASTIEL]

So, what? Now you can't taste PB and J?


CASTIEL

No, I-I taste every molecule.


SAM

Not the sum of its parts, huh?


CASTIEL

It's overwhelming. It's disgusting. [looks longingly at the sandwich] I miss you, PB and J.

[stands up]

We need to continue your healing. We're almost done.


[CASTIEL lays two fingers on SAM's forehead and starts to heal him. Suddenly he looks a little concerned]


SAM

What?


CASTIEL [trying to cover it up]

Nothing.


SAM [slaps his hand away]

You're a terrible liar.


CASTIEL

That is not true. I once deceived and betrayed both you and your brother.


SAM

Okay, that's not the point. Cas, what's wrong?


CASTIEL

I noticed something. It's, uh... It's resonating inside you.


SAM

What?


CASTIEL

Something angelic.


SAM

Okay, uh, what the hell does that mean?


CASTIEL

Maybe we should call Dean.


SAM [moves away and sits down on a chair]

No. He wanted to go, and he's gone. We'll handle this.


[Scene changes to inside John's storage locker. DEAN and CROWLEY walk in. DEAN removes the hood over CROWLEY's head.]


CROWLEY

Is all this really necessary? I mean, I've been inside your brother. We're practically family.


[DEAN's eyes flash with rage and he grabs CROWLEY swinging him into a shelf]


DEAN

Listen to me. We are the furthest thing from family. You got that, dickbag?


CROWLEY

Oh, yeah.


DEAN

Now, you want to hunt? Let's hunt.


[DEAN opens a small gate and walks through. CROWLEY goes to follow up realizes that the entrance is guarded by a Devil's Trap. He rolls his eyes]


CROWLEY

I'll be right here.

[he looks around at all the strange items on the shelves and in boxes as DEAN rummages through case folders.]

So, what do you call this decor, anyway? Rustic obsessive? Paranoid deco?

[CROWLEY picks up and opens a jar of sulfur and sniffs it. Disgusted, he puts it back]


DEAN

Here we go. [pulls out a file and starts to read] Looks like my dad was working with another hunter when he nabbed Abaddon's pet. [he holds up a picture of a woman]


CROWLEY

I guess the "T" didn't stand for terrible father. It stood for --


DEAN

Tara.

Doesn't ring a bell. [continues to read the file] All right, looks like they interrogated the demon. Then they exorcised him. But not before he mentioned the First Blade.


CROWLEY [smugly]

I love it when I'm right.


DEAN

Yeah, well, the rest of the file's empty, genius.


CROWLEY

What? Didn't they teach note-taking at Hunters Hogwarts?


DEAN

Let's go see if Tara's still kicking.


[Scene changes to SAM and CASTIEL in the Bunker doing some research.]


CASTIEL

I've found, well, something. It's a detail about when angels leave their vessels...I think. It's, uh, Enochian,

which can be a bit flowery. "And the departed shall remain, and the remains shall be the departed".


SAM

Okay, so, when an angel leaves a vessel, they leave behind a piece of themselves. Like, uh...like an angelic fingerprint.


CASTIEL

Whatever you want to call it, this piece of the departed contains Grace.


SAM

Wait, you're saying there's angelic Grace inside of me?


CASTIEL

Yes. But it's fading each time I heal you.


SAM

Okay. Is that good or bad?


CASTIEL

Well it's harmless. But the Grace itself... might be helpful.

[CASTIEL sets down the book and picks up a file titled 'On the Inner Workings of Angels']

According to this, we may be able to use the Grace that remains inside you to track Gadreel...If we can extract it.


SAM

How would we do that?


CASTIEL

Well...painfully.

[he holds up a picture of a huge syringe with a 4-inch long needle]

The Men of Letters believed that you could perform a tracking spell with extracted Grace, but they were never able to test the theory.


SAM

Well, they didn't have a guinea pig, but we do.


CASTIEL [looks up very confused]

You have a guinea pig? Where?


SAM

Me, Cas. I'm the guinea pig.


CASTIEL

Ohhh.


[SAM looks closer at the picture of the needle]


CASTIEL

Any idea where that is?


[DEAN AND CROWLEY walk into a pawn shop called Tara's. A fit lady in her fifties is leaning on the counter reading a comic book. She looks up.]


DEAN

Tara?


TARA

That's what the sign says. Can I help you?


DEAN

Yeah. Hope so. John Winchester ring a bell? I'm his son.


TARA

You Sam or Dean?


DEAN

Dean.


[Suddenly, behind the counter, TARA winces and grabs her right knee]


TARA

Well, didn't you grow up pretty. Still in the family business?


DEAN

Yeah, born and raised. Listen, bunch of years back, you worked a job with my dad. Well, me and my, uh, associate h--


TARA [raises a shotgun and aims it at the DEAN and CROWLEY]

Ever since '92, I get a painful little tickle in what's left of my knee whenever a demon is around.


CROWLEY

Hunters. So trusting. I'll go grab a latte while you get this sorted.


[CROWLEY snaps he fingers to disappear but nothing happens]


TARA

Devil's trap under the knock-off Persian, jackass.


DEAN [moves the rug with his boot to reveal a red Devil's Trap]

Tara listen, my, uh, associate --


CROWLEY

Friends -- besties, actually.


DEAN

Not helping.


TARA

Not caring.


CROWLEY

Look, I'm the King of Hell. He's a Winchester. There's a reason why we're working together.


TARA

Yeah. It's called possession.


[TARA grabs a bottle of holy water and splashes it in DEAN's face. DEAN looks very annoyed.]


DEAN

See? I'm good. Okay?

Yes, you're right. He is a jackass, but he's helping me on this.


TARA

Helping you with what?


DEAN

You and my old man found a demon who knew something about the First Blade. We need to find that blade.


TARA

Well, hell. You are as handsome as John. And as dumb, too, if you're looking for that old relic.


DEAN

We're hunting a Knight of Hell.


TARA

Why? They're all dead.


DEAN

One came back -- Abaddon.


TARA [lays a file on the counter]

The demon said the archangels used a weapon that could kill the Knights of Hell. We'd never heard of anything like the Knights of Hell or a First Blade. Your dad thought he was lying, trying to save himself. We took him out, and we had a lovely weekend together.

Then we went our separate ways. But I could never let the blade go. Something like that could really give a hunter an edge, you know? I looked all over the world -- destroyed my knee and my life. And all I found? [she unlocks a wall safe and takes out a tray full of spell ingredients.]

A location spell for the blade that I could never finish. Couldn't find one ingredient -- essence of Kraken.


CROWLEY

Kraken? I got a warehouse full of Kraken essence in Belize. Break the trap, I can be there and back before you say, "presto".


TARA

Presto.


CROWLEY

I can help. Dean?


DEAN

He wants Abaddon as dead as I do.


TARA

If your daddy could see you now.


[TARA walks around the counter and pushes back the rug with her foot. Then she takes out her shotgun and shoots the Devil's Trap breaking the outer ring. CROWLEY disappears.]


TARA

You know, even if that blade is real, it ain't worth being bosom buddies with the King of Hell.


DEAN

Abaddon? Way worse. I'll deal with Crowley after. Trust me.


TARA

You sound just like your dad... when he said he'd call me.


[DEAN is rather lost of words but CROWLEY reappears, saving him. He holds a small jar in his hand.]


CROWLEY

Shall we?


[DEAN and TARA mix the spell while CROWLEY looks on curiously. They lay out a map of the United States on the counter and TARA pours the liquid spell over it. DEAN lights a match and it flames up. The flames spreads to the outside corners of the map and then quickly burn away all of the map except for the state of Missouri. A spark lands in the middle of the state just northeast of Springfield and TARA points to it.]


TARA

Missouri. Figures.


CROWLEY

Would you care to join us?


TARA

Him? Anytime. You? Never.


DEAN

Thank you.


TARA

Good luck, Dean. You're gonna need it.


[DEAN nods and the men leave the pawn shop. The scene switches to the IMPALA driving up to a farmhouse. DEAN and CROWLEY get out. CROWLEY pauses as they walk toward the house.]


CROWLEY

Wait.


DEAN

What?


CROWLEY

I'm feeling something.


DEAN

What, cramps?


CROWLEY

I feel something dark.


DEAN

What, darker than you?


[CROWLEY is about to retort when he notices a man in a beekeeper suit tending bee hives over by the house. CROWLEY looks extremely worried.]


CROWLEY

Oh, no. We need to leave here now.


DEAN

What, are you allergic to bees?


CROWLEY

That's not a beekeeper. That's the father of murder.


DEAN

Sorry. Who?


CROWLEY

It's Cain.


DEAN

As in Cain and Abel?


CROWLEY

Dean. We need to be a world away from here -- from him.


[CROWLEY turns to leave and almost runs into CAIN who appeared behind him]


CAIN

You're not going anywhere. Crowley.

ACT TWO
[DEAN and CROWLEY sit inside CAIN's house on a couch. Dean is looking around assessing their options and CROWLEY is staring at the floor looking like he's about to panic.]


DEAN

Why don't you just zap out of here?


CROWLEY

I'd never leave my domestic partner in crime.


DEAN [snorts]

Yeah, like your heart grew three sizes. You can't zap out of here, can you?


CROWLEY

Cain's doing something to me.


DEAN

Well, it's not your day for getaways, is it? All right, so, tell me about this Cain.


CROWLEY

Well, after Cain killed Abel, he became a demon.


DEAN

What do you mean "became a demon"?


CROWLEY

I mean he became the deadliest demon to walk the face of the earth. Killed thousands. The best at being the worst. And then he just... Disappeared. Everyone thought he was dead or, at least, hoped he was.


[CAIN enters with a tea tray and CROWLEY cowers]


CAIN

Do either of you keep bees? It's very relaxing. They're such noble creatures. And the honey? Well, I keep it right on the comb.

[he sets the tray down on the coffee table and hands CROWLEY a cup. CROWLEY takes it but his hands are shaking in fright and so the tea cup rattles suspiciously.]

There you are.

[CAIN hands DEAN a cup of tea as well.]

They're dying, you know. Without bees, mankind will cease to exist. So, what are the King of Hell and a Winchester doing at my house?


DEAN

You know who we are?


CAIN

I'm retired. I'm not dead. What I don't know is why you're looking for me -- more importantly, how you found me.


CROWLEY [extremely nervous]

Ah, that's, uh, a funny story, really. Bit of a misunderstanding. We really should --


CAIN [motions with his hand and CROWLEY is rendered speechless]

Shh.


CROWLEY

[Stammers and tries to make a sound]


DEAN

Oh, you gotta teach me how to do that.


CAIN

Why are you here, Dean?


DEAN

We're looking for the weapon the archangels used to kill the Knights of Hell. The First Blade. We need it to kill a Knight of Hell -- Abaddon. [CAIN absentmindedly moves a ring on his left ring-finger. DEAN subtlety notices.] Look, I get it. You're retired. We're not here to get between

you and the demonic AARP, but it's bad out there, and I'm just looking to even the odds.


CAIN

One last time -- how did you find me?


DEAN

We didn't. The location spell was for the blade. One-time deal.


CAIN

Anyone else know you're here?


DEAN [smoothly]

No.


[Scene switches back to TARA's pawn shop. The stalker demon from the bar enters and TARA's knee hitches painfully.]


STALKER DEMON

Excuse me, ma'am. Wonder if you might have seen some of my friends pass through here. Big guy, kind of funny ears.


[TARA glances at the floor and the busted Devil's Trap. She makes a dive for her shot gun and shoots STALKER DEMON point blank in the face.]


[Back at CAIN's house]


CAIN [rising]

Well, it's been a pleasure having company, but once a century is enough for me. You can let yourselves out.


DEAN [follows after him]

Hey, listen, pal. We're not leaving here without the Blade.


CAIN

You have quite a reputation, Dean. I see the part about you being brave rings true.


DEAN

Well, what can I say? I'm an all-in kind of guy. Abaddon is the last Knight of Hell, and if you're out of the game, what the hell do you care if she dies?


CAIN

If your friend here could talk, he would tell you that I trained the Knights of Hell. I built that entire demonic order with my own hands -- Abaddon included.


DEAN [turns indignantly on CROWLEY]

Well, that is information I could have used five minutes ago!


[CROWLEY gasps in explanation, still unable to talk]


CAIN

Well, here's something your friend doesn't know, that no one knows, in fact -- outside of Abaddon. It wasn't the archangels that slaughtered the knights. It was me.


DEAN

Why did you turn on your own?


CAIN

Once again, I admire your bravery. But if you'll excuse me, I have errands to run in town. [he turns his back to leave] Goodbye, Dean Winchester... Never return.


[CROWLEY and DEAN exit the house]


CROWLEY

Well, that was lovely. Can we leave the country now?


DEAN

But you said the First Blade was our only shot at killing Abaddon. This is the closest you've been to it. We're not leaving.


CROWLEY

Will you listen to reason for once?


DEAN

Hey. He said he was going into town. Awesome. We wait till he's gone, come back, bust in, take what's ours. Got it?


[Scene switches to the Bunker. SAM and CASTIEL are walking down the stairs in the main room.]


CASTIEL

Sam, may I ask you a question?


SAM [Jokingly]

You just did.


CASTIEL

Can I ask you another question?


SAM

Well, technically, you -- yeah, go ahead. What's up?


[They stop in the doorway to the hall and face each other]


CASTIEL

Sam, the trials. You chose not to go through with them for a reason, didn't you? You chose to live rather than to sacrifice yourself. You and Dean... You chose each other.


SAM [clearly not wanting to talk about it]

Yeah, I did. We did. And then... Dean made a choice for me.


[SAM stalks off to the medical room. CASTIEL follows.]


CASTIEL

What Dean did --


SAM

It doesn't matter what Dean did. Look, I could have put a stop to all this, Cas. I could have closed the gates of hell.


CASTIEL

Oh, Sam.


SAM

Dean's gone, okay? This is on me now, and if I can find Gadreel... I can fix this.

[SAM sets a box down on a table next to a gurney. He talks off his plaid button-up shirt leaving him in just a thin t-shirt.]

Now...being a human means settling your debts.

[SAM hands the box to CASTIEL and sits down on the gurney.]

Let's start balancing the books.


[CASTIEL opens the box and it is revealed to contain the huge needle pictured in the file]


[Scene changes to DEAN and CROWLEY entering CAIN's house sneakily.]


CROWLEY [whispering]

This is by far the dumbest idea you've ever had.


DEAN

Yeah, well, it's early.


CROWLEY [peeks in the front room and then backs away]

Oh, there's nothing here. Shame. Let's go.


DEAN

Hey! Sack up and start looking, okay? We don't have that much time.


[DEAN looks around the living room and as he does he notices a picture on the mantel. He picks it up to look closer. It is a old picture of a woman and it says COLETTE on the bottom. DEAN looks closer and notices that she is wearing a ring very similar to the ring on CAIN's hand.]


[Outside the house, STALKER DEMON drives up in a huge truck. He is on the phone.]


STALKER DEMON

You'll never believe what the Winchester and Crowley found. Send back-up. Send...Everybody.


[He hisses painfully as he pulls the phone away from his ear and we can see that his ear is missing and most of the skin on the side of his face is blown away from TARA's shotgun. STALKER DEMON looks at his face in the mirror]


ACT THREE
[Scene opens in the medical room at the Bunker. SAM is lying on the gurney and CASTIEL has the huge syringe needle posed to extract some angel grace. He punctures the needle into the side of SAM's neck, right below his left ear. SAM gasps in pain.]


CASTIEL [looking concerned]

Now comes the part that will actually hurt. I'm gonna begin the extraction.


[CASTIEL slowly pulls back the plunger and the bottom of the syringe barrel fills with a tiny bit of angel grace. SAM is trying very hard not to cry out from the pain.]


SAM [gasping]

Is it working?


CASTIEL

Yeah.


SAM

But?


CASTIEL

I-I need to push the needle in deeper. We need more Grace in order to cast the spell.


SAM

Okay. Do it.


CASTIEL

Sam, if I get too close to --


SAM

Damn it, Cas! Just do it.


[CASTIEL slowly pushes the needle deeper and starts pulling back on the plunger again. Suddenly, SAM's body lurges and he has flashbacks to images of when GADREEL was inside of him and then to some of the moments when he was performing the trials. CASTIEL pulls out the needle.]


SAM [in shock]

What the hell was that?


CASTIEL

Your body is regressing to the state it was in before Gadreel.


SAM

Do we have enough Grace for the summoning spell?


CASTIEL

Sam.


SAM

Do we or not, Cas?


CASTIEL

No.


SAM

Then keep going.


[CASTIEL again looks very concerned and reluctant.]


[Scene changes back to CAIN's house. DEAN and CROWLEY are still searching.]


CROWLEY

Nothing. Not even porn.


DEAN

Think I figured out why he went off the reservation so many years ago.

[he hands the picture of COLETTE to CROWLEY]


CROWLEY

Lovely. Little plain. Who is she?


DEAN

Cain had a similar ring on. Father of murder got hitched.


[They look up as they hear all the doors in the house lock.]


DEAN

He's back. Come on.

[they try the front door but it is solidly locked]

Go!


[CAIN appears behind them. He motions to the picture CROWLEY still holds in his hand.]


CAIN

That belongs to me.


CROWLEY

Sorry. [Hands the picture of COLETTE back to CAIN] Gorgeous, by the way.


[Headlights flash from the driveway and DEAN walks to a window and draws back the curtain. It is STALKER DEMON with five more demons in tow.]


DEAN

I don't suppose they're with you.


CAIN

No.


[STALKER DEMON starts to call to DEAN from the truck.]

I guess we can't wait any longer. Your friend Tara was very helpful! Got downright chatty... After I peeled all her skin off. We don't want any trouble, Cain. Just want the so-called King and the Winchester. I got a new master to impress, and I'm betting bagging those two will do just that.


DEAN [turning to CROWLEY]

"Master"?


CROWLEY

Abaddon. This lot all need to die. I count --


DEAN

Too many. [to CAIN] The whammy you put on the doors that keeps us in. Will it keep them out?


CAIN

For now.


DEAN

I'm gonna barricade the entrances. Get ready for a fight.


CAIN

Well, good luck with that.


DEAN

What?


CAIN

You exposed my home. You exposed me.


DEAN

Well, boo-hoo!


CAIN

Brave, but impulsive. You truly have lived up to your reputation.


DEAN

I can't say you've lived up to yours.


CAIN

What can I say? I'm retired. If you survive, you're welcome to join me for the last meal I will eat in this house before I disappear again. It's the least I can do.


[CAIN sets his groceries on the table and DEAN and CROWLEY exchange looks.]


[Scene switches to the medical room in the Bunker. CASTIEL is still extracting angel grace and SAM is almost unconscious from the pain.]


CASTIEL

Sam? Sam?!


SAM [weakly]

Keep going.


CASTIEL

Why?


SAM

We -- we -- we have to find Gadreel.


CASTIEL [starting to remove the needle from SAM's neck]

No. Why must the Winchesters run toward death?


SAM [grasps the syringe in CASTIEL's hand and stops him from removing it]

No, don't. Don't. Don't stop.


CASTIEL

Sam, when I was human, I died, and that showed me that life is precious, and it must be protected at all costs, even a life as... as pig-headed as a Winchester's.


SAM [voice heartbreaking soft]

My life's not worth any more than anyone else's -- not yours or Dean's...or Kevin's. Please. Please, help me do one thing right.

Keep going.


[CASTIEL hesitants and then pushes the needle in further. SAM screams in pain.]


[Back in CAIN's house, DEAN is pushing furniture in front of all the doors. He looks at CROWLEY]


DEAN

All right, I got this. You take the front.


[CROWLEY moves to the living room; closing the glass doors behind him. CAIN sits down at the table and starts to pull husks off the corn in front of him.]


DEAN

So, this is your play?! Corn?! What am I not getting here? I mean, it's not like you're a coward.


CAIN

Since when does the great Dean Winchester ask for help? Well, that doesn't sound like the man I've read about on demon bathroom walls. Maybe you've lost a step. Let's find out.

[He snaps his fingers and the door (and the fridge in front of it) fly open and STALKER DEMON and a GIRL DEMON rush in. CAIN snaps his fingers again and the door slams shut in front of the others outside.]


CAIN [to the demons]

Oh, don't mind me.

[motions to DEAN]

Enjoy yourself.


[DEAN pulls the demon knife from his jacket as a third demon crashes through the glass doors behind him. DEAN flinches as glass sprays his back. He turns to face WINDOW DEMON, swings the knife at him but WINDOW DEMON ducks and punches DEAN in the stomach. DEAN gets in a kick but WINDOW DEMON sends him flying across the table and onto the other side with STALKER DEMON and GIRL DEMON. CAIN watches the whole thing while sitting at the table shucking corn. STALKER DEMON swings at DEAN but DEAN grabs his hand and pulls it over his shoulder. He stabs the knife into the demon making him glow yellow and die. As STALKER DEMON falls to the floor GIRL DEMON grabs DEAN from one side and WINDOW DEMON kicks the back of DEAN's left knee making his legs buckle. The two demons grab DEAN's arms and flip him up onto the table on his back. GIRL DEMON steals the demon knife out of DEAN's hand. As DEAN struggles to get a upper hand, CAIN calmly leans over.]


CAIN

Doing great.


[DEAN just glares at him and finally pulls his right leg back far enough to kick GIRL DEMON into the far wall. He exchanges a few punches with WINDOW DEMON and kicks him into the counter. He turns to face girl demon who brandishes the knife. DEAN quickly picks up a yellow dish towel to protect himself. As she lunges at him he swings out of her way and wraps the towel around her neck. He whips her into the fridge and then into the china cabinet. WINDOW DEMON finally picks himself off the floor DEAN turns around and throws a pot at him and kicks him back into the counter. As WINDOW DEMON gets up again he grabs a kitchen knife from a holder on the counter. When he turns around DEAN has GIRL DEMON in a hold. DEAN grabs the demon knife out of her hand and stabs her in the stomach.


[Camera changes to CROWLEY still guarding the living room. One demon flies through the door and faces CROWLEY.]


CROWLEY [looking annoyed]

Really? Isn't it past your bedtime?


[The demon rushes him and punches him to the ground.]


CROWLEY

You're good.


[As the demon goes for the kill, CROWLEY pulls out his angel blade and stabs him in the side. He dies instantly]


CROWLEY

But I'm Crowley.


[Back in the kitchen with DEAN. WINDOW DEMON throws DEAN into the china cabinet as CAIN gets up to get a beer. WINDOW DEMON grabs DEAN and sends him flying across the floor and into the cabinets on the other side of the kitchen. CROWLEY watches silently from the door and CAIN sits back down with his beer. DEAN and WINDOW DEMON exchange violent punches and DEAN finally gets enough leverage to slam him onto the table. In one quick move, DEAN swings back and stabs him in the neck with the demon knife. DEAN looks triumphantly at CAIN and pulls the knife out and pushes the body off the table.]


DEAN [Exhausted]

What was that? Some kind of a test?


CAIN [sipping his beer]

I felt connected to you right from the beginning. Kindred spirits, if you will. You and I are very much alike.


DEAN

Right. Yeah, except I didn't kill my brother.


CAIN

You saved yours. Why?


DEAN

Because you never give up on family -- ever.


CAIN

Where's your brother now, then?


DEAN

I don't know what kind of game you're playing here, and I don't really care. Just give me the damn blade.


CAIN

Sorry, Dean. I have nothing to hand over.


DEAN

What?


CAIN

I no longer have the blade. It's gone.


[Scene changes to CASTIEL and SAM in the medical room in the Bunker. SAM is slowly fading with blood dripping from his nose and ear as CASTIEL continues to extract angel grace. CASTIEL looks up to see his PB&J sandwich still sitting on the table. He makes up his mind and starts to pull the needle out of SAM's neck.]


CASTIEL

Hold on. This may pinch.


SAM

Cas, what the hell?

[CASTIEL presses his fingers to SAM's forehead.]

Cas. What the hell was that?!


CASTIEL

I've healed your wounds completely.


SAM

And the Grace?


CASTIEL

Well, whatever Grace was inside you is gone now. What's left of Gadreel is in here. We'll just have to try the spell with what we have.


SAM

Damn it.


CASTIEL

Sam, I want Gadreel to pay as much as you do. But nothing is worth losing you. You know, being human, it didn't just change my view of food. It changed my view of you. I mean, I can relate now to how you feel.


SAM

What are you talking about?


CASTIEL

The only person who has screwed things up more consistently than you...is me. And now I know what that guilt feels like. And I know what it... I know what it means to feel sorry, Sam. I am sorry.


SAM

I know.


CASTIEL

You know, old me -- I would've have just kept going. I would've jammed that needle in deeper until you died because the ends always justified the means. But what I went though -- Well, that PB and J taught me that angels can change, so...who knows? Maybe Winchesters can, too.

ACT FOUR
[Back in CAIN's house]


CROWLEY

"Gone"? What do you mean, "gone"? How? The spell brought us here to you, so it has to be here.


CAIN

Your spell brought you to the source of the Blade's power. Me.


[CAIN pulls up his right sleeve to reveal a mark burned into his forearm. CROWLEY shrinks back and makes the sign of the cross over his heart.]


DEAN [to CROWLEY]

Really? Now?


CROWLEY

It's the bloody mark of Cain.


CAIN

From Lucifer himself. The mark and the blade work together. Without the mark, the blade is useless. It's just an old bone.


CROWLEY

A bone?


DEAN

The jawbone of an animal. The jawbone you used to kill Abel because he was God's favorite.


CAIN

Abel wasn't talking to God. He was talking to Lucifer. Lucifer was gonna make my brother into his pet. I couldn't bear to watch him be corrupted, so I offered a deal -- Abel's soul in heaven for my soul in hell.

Lucifer accepted... As long as I was the one who sent Abel to heaven. So, I killed him. Became a soldier of Hell -- a knight.


DEAN

And Lucifer ordered you to make more.


CAIN

My knights and I, we did horrible things -- for centuries. Bringers of chaos and darkness.


DEAN

Then you met Colette.


CAIN

She knew who I was... and what I was. She loved me unconditionally. She forgave me. She only asked for one thing.


CROWLEY

To stop.


CAIN

When the knights found out, they took retribution. They took Colette, so I picked the First Blade back up, and it felt so good to have it in my hands again, and I slaughtered the Knights of Hell.


DEAN

Not all of them.


CAIN

No.


[Scene returns to the cabin from 1863 with CAIN charging into the guarded room. COLETTE sits at a vanity mirror and greets him with a smile.]


CAIN

Colette.


COLETTE

My love.


[When she turns around, CAIN's face hardens in recognition.]


CAIN [Horrified]

What have you done to my wife?

[COLETTE's eyes turn black]

Answer me, Abaddon!


ABADDON

We can make this right. Can't we, Cain? Come back to us. Come back to me.


CAIN

I'm done.


ABADDON

With the Knights or with me?


CAIN

I'm done!


ABADDON [Angrily]

Then so is she.

[She starts to snap bones in COLETTE's body]


CAIN

No. Stop it!


ABADDON

We could have been forever, but you chose her. Well, if I can't have you, then neither can she. [Snaps her neck] Enjoying the view? I know I am. Best seat in the house.


[At the same time that CAIN leaps forward to stab her, ABADDON flees in a cloud of black smoke. CAIN sinks the first blade into COLETTE's chest.]


CAIN [in a panic, grasping at her and sinking to the floor.]

No, Colette! Colette, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I will find Abaddon, and I will kill her.


COLETTE

No, there's been enough killing. Promise me. You're better than all of this.


[COLETTE tries to kiss Cain and dies in his arms. CAIN sobs.]


CAIN [Voice-over]

So I buried her, and I walked away.


[Scene then changes back to CAIN's house with CAIN telling the story.]


DEAN

Well, I'm sorry -- truly. But I have to stop Abaddon. So, where is the Blade?


CAIN [walking away]

No.


DEAN [chasing after him]

Hey! Listen, you son of a bitch. You may be done killing, but I'm not.


CAIN [turns and grasps the demon knife in DEAN's hand and plunges it into his own chest]

You never give up on anything, do you?


DEAN

Never.


CAIN

[CAIN pulls the knife out of his chest]

Well, I do.

[CAIN disappears]


DEAN

Cain? Cain?!


[There are many sounds outside the window and DEAN and CROWLEY pull back the curtain to see dozens of demons preparing an attack.]


CROWLEY

Well, I'll stay as long as I can.


DEAN

Aren't you a peach?


[We see CAIN in a small grove of trees. He kneels down next to a lone grave marker]


CAIN [Miserably]

I've tried... I've tried, Colette, to see myself as you did... But I know who I am -- What I am... I know you

watch over me still... But I need you to look away now... [Leans over to kiss the ground]


[CAIN reappears in the house with DEAN and CROWLEY and stares at the picture of COLETTE]


DEAN

What the hell, man? You in or out? I'm getting head spins.


CAIN

I can give you the mark, Dean, if it's what you truly want.


DEAN

What are you talking about?


CAIN

The mark can be transferred to someone who's worthy.


DEAN

You mean a killer like you?


CAIN

Yes.


DEAN

Can I use it to kill that bitch?


CAIN

Yes. But you have to know with the mark comes a great burden. Some would call it a great cost.


DEAN

Yeah, well, spare me the warning label. You had me at "kill the bitch".


CAIN

Good luck, Dean. You're gonna to need it.


DEAN

Yeah, I get that a lot. Let's dance.


[CAIN grasps DEAN's right forearm with his and a line of red veins spread from CAIN's mark to burn an identical mark on DEAN's forearm. DEAN gasps in pain as the mark is transferred from CAIN's arm.]


CROWLEY

Dean?


DEAN

I'm fine. All right, where the hell did you stash the damn blade?


CAIN

Nothing can destroy the Blade, so I threw it to the bottom of the deepest ocean. It's the only way I could

keep my promise to Colette. You find the blade, kill Abaddon, but make me a promise first. When I call you -- and I will call -- you come find me and use the Blade on me.


DEAN

Why?


CAIN

For what I'm about to do.


[CAIN grasps DEAN and CROWLEY's shoulders and they are flashed to the outside of the house. All the demons rush into the house and CAIN locks them inside with him. Suddenly a red hot light lights up the windows from the inside.]


CROWLEY

They're all trapped in there.


DEAN

With him.

ACT FIVE
[Scene opens with SAM and CASTIEL mixing the spell to track GADREEL. They add all the ingrediants and then finally add the angel grace. The mixture boils and then fades away. CASTIEL looks away, disappointed.]


SAM

Was that, uh... Was that it?


CASTIEL

I'm afraid there wasn't enough Grace. We'll have to find Gadreel another way. I'm sorry, Sam.


SAM

It's all right, Cas. You, uh... You were right. You were right about everything.


[SAM suddenly leans over and hugs CASTIEL tightly. CASTIEL stand awkwardly without moving.]


SAM

Now's the part where you hug back.


CASTIEL [moving to hug SAM back]

Oh. Right. Uh, sorry.


SAM [chuckling]

Ah, there you go.


CASTIEL

As far as I'm concerned, Metatron is the key to fixing everything that's wrong. I'm gonna find him.

[CASTIEL begins to walk away, but stops and turns to SAM]

You know, Sam, we could use all the help we could get to find Gadreel and Metatron.


SAM [solidly]

We got this.


[Scene changes to DEAN and CROWLEY in the parked IMPALA.]


CROWLEY

He was right, you know. You are worthy.


DEAN

Oh, great. Now you're gonna get all touchy-feely, too?


CROWLEY

Your problem, mate, is that nobody hates you more than you do. Believe me, I've tried.


DEAN [brushes him off]

So, how do we find this Blade?


CROWLEY [getting out of the IMPALA]

You can't search the bottom of the ocean, but I can. So, I'll find it and bring it to its new owner.


DEAN [getting out after him]

I saw you, Crowley. Back at Cain's.

[Flashback to DEAN fighting WINDOW DEMON with CROWLEY watching from the glass doors.]

You dusted that undercard demon, and then you just sat back and watched the main event.

[Scene changes back to DEAN and CROWLEY standing outside the Impala.]

You knew. You knew about the mark. You knew about Abaddon and Cain. You knew all of it. And you played me. Why?


CROWLEY

[Flashback to CROWLEY smiling as he drinks his tea during their first conversation with CAIN.]

He would never have given me the Blade.

[Scene changes back to DEAN and CROWLEY standing outside the Impala.]

Who can say no to you? I needed you to play along.


DEAN

[Flashback to STALKER DEMON staring at DEAN and CROWLEY as they walked away.]

You knew we were being followed, and you didn't say anything.

[Scene changes back to DEAN and CROWLEY standing outside the Impala.]


CROWLEY

Well, Cain would want we were to see his prize fighter up close. You plus demons equals fight night.


DEAN

Tara died. Thanks to you.


CROWLEY

Omelets. Broken eggs. Et cetera.


DEAN [angrily punches CROWLEY]

After I kill Abaddon... you're next!


CROWLEY

You don't mean that. We're having too much fun.

[DEAN starts to walk away]

Listen up. Even with the Blade, we're gonna need all the help we can get against Abaddon.


DEAN [Stops. Looking Annoyed]

Go find the Blade.


CROWLEY

It's always something with you boys, isn't it?


[CROWLEY disappears and DEAN hisses in pain and pulls up his right sleeve. The mark is burned deep in his skin. The camera pulls back showing DEAN standing alone next to the IMPALA.]
