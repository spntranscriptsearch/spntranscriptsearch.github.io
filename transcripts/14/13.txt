TEASER

EXTERIOR – PRECIOUS PAWN – DAY

[DEAN stands outside the shop. SAM joins him as they walk to the door.]

INTERIOR – PRECIOUS PAWN – DAY

[SAM and DEAN walk into the pawn shop. They walk to the counter, where TERRY is standing.]

TERRY

Howdy, fellas. Anything on the shelves, 20 percent off. Today only.

SAM

Great. Well, actually, we are, uh – we’re looking for the good stuff.

[DEAN takes out a bundle of cash.]

DEAN

The really good stuff.

INTERIOR – BACK ROOM – DAY

[TERRY opens the door to a back room. SAM and DEAN follow him in.]

TERRY

Everything back here is one of a kind. You got your basics – hands of glory, your Gris-Gris bags, your anointed dove’s blood. And then… we have the more premium items. You boys ever mess with dragon’s breath?

SAM

Actually, we’re, uh – we’re searching for something pretty specific.

TERRY

How specific?

DEAN

The skull of Sarah Good. She was executed during the Salem Witch Trials.

TERRY

Oh, I know who she was. And I think I can help you.

[TERRY opens the locker behind him. SAM picks up a teddy bear from the shelf and tries to pull the loop on its back.]

TERRY

I wouldn’t do that.

[SAM puts the bear back on the shelf. TERRY takes a skull out from the locker.]

TERRY

I’ll tell you what. I’ll make you a deal. I got this for a song at a flea market up in Pawtucket –

DEAN

No, you didn’t. Belongs to Bart Kemp. See, he’s a friend of ours – a hunter. Worked out of Boston up until last week. Somebody killed him – cut him clean in half.

SAM

See, when they, uh, found the body, his place had been emptied out, but I guess you already knew that, didn’t you?

TERRY

Huh.

[TERRY picks up the bottle of dragon’s breath and sprays it at the boys. The flames push them back. DEAN falls against the door, as SAM falls on the floor. TERRY takes a large sword and walks towards SAM.]

TERRY

Now, this – it’s called Chrysaor. Supposed to be able to cut through anything. Sliced up your pal real good with just one swing, but you – oh, you’re a big boy. You might take some work.

[TERRY swings his arms up, but a gunshot rings out, hitting him in the chest. He falls to the floor, the sword falling from his hands. DEAN is standing behind him, a gun in his hands.]

DEAN

They always talk too much.

INTERIOR – BACK ROOM – DAY

[TERRY is lying dead on the floor. SAM looks over a ledger.]

SAM

Whoa. Dean, according to this, he’s got a ton of occult objects here.

DEAN

What do you want to do with all this crap?

SAM

I don’t know. I mean, I-I guess we, uh, take it home, right?

[DEAN picks up the dragon’s breath and sprays it. The flames rise, but Dean stops pressing it. SAM shakes his head at DEAN.]

DEAN

Right, yeah. Good plan. Home.

ACT ONE

EXTERIOR – HIGHWAY – DAY

[The Impala drives down the highway.]

EXTERIOR – LEBANON VISTA THEATRE – DAY

[A group of teens sit outside the theatre.]

ELIOT

People say they’re brothers. All I know is I was standing right here when I heard this – bam! From the trunk of their car. And then this, like, shallow breathing.

MAX

No way.

STACY

Eliot, you’re creeping Max out.

[The Impala engine rumbles, and stops right in front of the theatre.]

ELIOT

That’s them.

[SAM and DEAN get out of the car. SAM is holding the ledger in his hand.]

DEAN

So what – you’re saying all this stuff is lethal?

SAM

Yeah, it looks like.

INTERIOR – LIQUOR STORE – DAY

[SAM and DEAN walk in. JACKSON is behind the counter.]

JACKSON

Hey. The Campbell brothers. Lemme guess – the usual?

DEAN

Make it double.

SAM

Dean, listen to this. Uh, hangman’s rope, fairy dust, John Wayne Gacy’s cigar box.

DEAN

So we’re talkin’, like, 31 flavors of weird, huh?

SAM

Pretty much, yeah. Listen, Jack and Cas are out with Jules and her crew, but when they get back, they can give us a hand cataloging all of this.

DEAN

Oh, cataloging, fun.

SAM

Something like this – maybe it’s what we need, you know, to – to… take your mind off things.

DEAN

Things? What things? Oh, you mean that thing that’s riding shotgun up in my head? That thing?

EXTERIOR – LEBANON VISTA THEATRE – DAY

ELIOT

I mean, think about it. Where do they even come from? Them or their weird sidekick with the trench coat. And what about that kid with the dumb Bambi on his face all the time?

MAX

So what? That doesn’t mean that they kidnapped Bigfoot or whatever.

[The girls laugh.]

ELIOT
You guys are dicks.

[STACY’s cell phone rings.]

STACY

Gotta bounce. See you later? At the thing?

MAX
Sure, yeah.

[STACY gets up from the bench and walks to the Impala.]

STACY

Whatever their deal is, they got an awesome car.

[MAX looks at the Impala and smiles.]

INTERIOR – LIQUOR STORE – DAY

[SAM is looking through the ledger.]

SAM

You’re not gonna believe this.

[DEAN turns to him. They look at the ledger together.]

SAM

It’s called the Baozhu. It’s one of eight ancient Chinese treasures. I-It’s a pearl that grants wishes. Sort of.

DEAN

Sort of?

SAM

Well, technically, it’s supposed to give you “what your heart desires.”

DEAN

That would be Michael outta my friggin’ head.

SAM

Exactly.

DEAN

So, you’re telling me that the answer to all of our problems is sitting right outside in the ca –

[SAM and DEAN see the Impala being driven away. DEAN rushes out of the bar.]

EXTERIOR – LEBANON VISTA THEATRE – DAY

DEAN

No, no, no, no, no! What the…

[SAM and DEAN turn to see ELIOT across the street, watching the car drive off.]

SAM

Hey, hey, hey!

[They run across the street to reach ELIOT.]

DEAN

Hey, hey! Don’t move!

ELIOT

I didn’t see anything, I swear.

SAM

Okay. Listen, that car is dangerous, okay?

DEAN

Swear to God, if anything happens to that car –

ELIOT

Please, I don’t wanna die!

[SAM and DEAN look confused.]

SAM

Die? Why – why would you… Just tell us what you saw.

ELIOT

I don’t wanna narc.

DEAN

You don’t have a choice.

ELIOT

Okay. It’s this girl Max. She’s new in town, so I don’t even know where she lives.

[DEAN gets angry.]

SAM

Don’t.

[SAM pushes DEAN away, and they walk back across the street.]

INTERIOR – POSTAL STATION – DAY

[MARTA is behind the counter. SAM walks in.]

MARTA

Help you?

SAM

I hope so. Um, I’m looking for a – a local kid, a teenager – Max something. I feel bad. I paid her to wash my car, but she took off before I could tip her, and I figured you knew everyone in town –

MARTA

So you want me to give you an underage girl’s address?

SAM

No, uh –

[DEAN walks into the postal station.]

SAM

It’s not like that.

DEAN

Marta. How’s that grandson of yours?

MARTA

Oh, he’s a spoiled little jerk, but I love him.

DEAN

‘Course you do. Uh, listen, my brother and I, we just need to talk to this girl, okay? So, if you could help us out, I would – I would really appreciate it.

MARTA

Oh, now, Dean, I-I-I can’t just go around handing out addresses all willy nilly. I-I-I-I took a vow.

DEAN

Please.

[DEAN places his hand on tops of MARTA’s on the counter. He taps it a few times.]

MARTA

But, um… I can tell you where to find her mother.

DEAN

Oh. Alright.

[SAM looks at MARTA, annoyed. DEAN smiles at MARTA.]

INTERIOR – RESTAURANT – DAY

[SAM and DEAN are talking to MAX’s mom, CAITLIN.]

CAITLIN

I’m gonna kill her.

DEAN

Does Max have a phone?

SAM

O-or do you have any idea where she might have gone?

CAITLIN

She’s supposed to be in school.

[Another employee walks into the room.]

EMPLOYEE

Skip day.

DEAN

What day?

EMPLOYEE
February 7th – that’s skip day. Kids ditch school. Some of them head out to this old house on Route 36 – throw a party. It’s a small town, man. Kids got to blow off steam.

EXTERIOR – OLD HOUSE, ROUTE 36 – DAY

[The Impala is parked outside the house.]

INTERIOR – OLD HOUSE, ROUTE 36 – DAY

[All of the occult objects are inside the house. STACY picks up the bear.]

STACY

What is all this stuff?

MAX
Found it in the back of the car.

BEA

Uh, creepy.

STACY

No. It’s awesome.

GUY

Pizza’s here!

STACY

Oh, thank God.

[STACY and the other girl get up from the couch.]

BEA

Oh, I’m so excited for pizza.

STACY

Me too. I haven’t eaten all morning.

[They leave the room. The cigar box opens. A cloud smoke comes out and forms into a hand.]

ACT TWO

INTERIOR – OLD HOUSE, ROUTE 36 – DAY

[ELIOT runs into the house.]

ELIOT
Hey! Th-those guys, they’re after Max, and they said something about –

STACY

Dude, one – you’re not supposed to be here. Two – chill. Max can handle herself.

INTERIOR – BATHROOM – DAY

[A boy, ETHAN walks into the bathroom. He blows a puff of air out of his mouth and chuckles. He starts to wash his hands. The mirror starts to frost. He wipes his hands and then wipes the mirror. A ghost of a clown stands in the mirror. The clown jumps at ETHAN.]

EXTERIOR – OLD HOUSE, ROUTE 36 – DAY

[An old pick-up truck stops outside the house. SAM and DEAN get out. DEAN walks over to the Impala.]

DEAN

Oh, Baby. Baby, Baby, please tell me you’re not hurt.

[DEAN looks over the Impala. SAM checks the backseat.]

SAM

Dean. Back seat.

[They both look into the back seat.]

SAM

It’s empty.

BEA

Ethan! Ethan, wait!

[ETHAN and BEA walk out of the house and rush past SAM and DEAN. SAM stops BEA.]

SAM

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. What happened? What’s going on?

BEA

He said he saw a ghost. It was a clown. He said it tried to kill him!

[DEAN runs to the house. SAM runs behind him.]

INTERIOR – OLD HOUSE, ROUTE 36 – DAY

[SAM and DEAN rush in, with their FBI badges. DEAN holds up his gun.]

DEAN

FBI! Everybody out! Let’s go! Move, move!

[All the teens run out of the house, except for ELIOT. SAM holds up his badge.]

SAM

Go!

ELIOT
FBI?

DEAN

Hey, let’s go. Come on, huh?

[DEAN pushes ELIOT out of the room and puts his gun back in his jeans.]

DEAN

Alright. Any of this stuff scream “clown” to you?

[SAM looks around the room. He sees the cigar box opened.]

SAM

John Wayne Gacy’s cigar box. I mean…

[SAM’s breath can be seen.]

DEAN

We should burn that right now.

SAM

Oh, yeah.

[SAM picks up the box and takes it to the fireplace in the room.]

DEAN

A serial killer clown. I mean, this is, like, the best/worst thing that’s ever happened to you, you know, ‘cause you love serial killers, but – but you hate clowns.

SAM

Yeah, I get it, Dean.

DEAN

Yeah, just saying.

[SAM puts lighter fluid over the box. He takes out his lighter and tries to flick it on. The lights in the room start to flicker.]

SAM

Come on.

DEAN

Sam… today.

[The lighter still doesn’t come on. The ghost clown appears behind DEAN. DEAN turns around and sees it.]

DEAN

Sam.

[The ghost clown rushes towards DEAN.]

EXTERIOR – OLD HOUSE, ROUTE 36 – DAY

[All the teens are waiting outside.]

ELIOT

Screw this.

[ELIOT runs back inside.]

STACY

Eliot, no!

[STACY runs after him.]

INTERIOR – OLD HOUSE, ROUTE 36 – DAY

[DEAN gets thrown against the couch. The box catches fire. The ghost clown screams as he goes up in flames. ELIOT rushes in as this happens, STACY stopping next to him, MAX behind her. When the ghost is gone, SAM and DEAN see the three teens standing there.]

SAM

Uh…

DEAN

Hey!

INTERIOR – OLD HOUSE, ROUTE 36 – DAY

[ELIOT, MAX and STACY are sitting on the couch. SAM and DEAN stand in front of them.]

ELIOT

That was a ghost!

SAM

Yeah, yeah, okay, listen. I-I know you need – or you want some sort of rational explanation for what happened here, but… there isn’t one.

[The teens look at SAM and DEAN with blank expressions.]

SAM

My brother and I, we hunt things. Evil things that shouldn’t exist.

DEAN

And we are damn good at what we do.

ELIOT

I knew it!

SAM

Yeah, but if most people out there knew the truth, if they knew what was out there –

DEAN

They’d lose their freaking minds. So what you saw here today, we’re gonna keep that a secret.

[SAM and DEAN look at the teens, as they look back at them.]

STACY

Okay.

EXTERIOR – HIGHWAY – NIGHT

[The Impala drives down the highway.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[SAM is standing at the table, holding the Baozhu in his hands. DEAN is sitting at the table, with a beer.]

DEAN

John Wayne Gacy’s ghost. Well, that’s one of the record books.

SAM

Dean.

DEAN

Hm?

SAM

I think this is it.

DEAN

The pearl?

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Let’s do it.

SAM

Are you – are you sure you don’t want to call Mom or – or wait for Cas?

DEAN

No. No, ‘cause, you know, if this mojo works like you say, great. If not… why get their hopes up?

[DEAN stands up next to SAM.]

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Okay.

[SAM gives DEAN the pearl.]

DEAN

So, what do I…

SAM

I don’t know. I-I guess you – you hold the pearl and – and concentrate on what your heart desires.

DEAN

Michael outta my head. Got it.

[DEAN picks up the pearl and holds it in his hand. He looks at SAM before closing his fist around it, closing his eyes. The lights in the bunker start to flicker, the red emergency lights coming on. DEAN opens his eyes as he and SAM look around the room.]

[A man appears from behind them and swings at SAM. SAM moves, but the man hits him with his gun, pushing him to the floor. DEAN swings at the man, but the man hits him with his several times, sending DEAN to the ground, near SAM. A gun cocks.]

MAN

Don’t you move.

[The emergency light turns off, the regular lights come back on. DEAN and SAM look at the man in shock.]

DEAN

Dad?

[The man is JOHN.]

ACT THREE

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY– NIGHT

[JOHN looks at the boys in shock.]

JOHN

Dean? Sam? What in the hell?

[JOHN looks around the room, as the boys stand up from the floor.]

JOHN

Sammy. Aren’t you supposed to be in Palo Alto?

SAM

Palo Alto?

JOHN

What happened to you?

DEAN

What year is it?

JOHN

It’s 2003.

SAM

It’s 2019.

JOHN

No. How?

SAM

We, uh… I-I think we summoned you.

JOHN

You boys better tell me what the hell is going on right now.

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[DEAN pours whiskey into a glass. JOHN picks it up and takes a sip.]

JOHN

So, you saved the world?

DEAN

More than once.

JOHN

Then it’s all true. God, the devil, you boys smack in the middle. Now you live in a secret bunker with an angel and Lucifer’s kid.

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Yeah.

JOHN

And you’ve done this whole time-travel thing before?

DEAN

A few times. Actually, uh, our grandfather, your dad – he’s the one who helped us find this place. I think he’d be real happy to know you’re finally here.

JOHN

Right. Man of Letters.

SAM

Yeah. W-We’re legacies… because of you.

[JOHN smiles at SAM, then chuckles to himself.]

JOHN

So, you’ve, um – you’ve been busy.

SAM

A little bit.

JOHN

I-I don’t… I-I just… I just wish that I had been there to see it.

DEAN

Dad, none of this would have happened without you.

JOHN

It’s good. It’s fine. I-I went out takin’ out Yellow Eyes. I mean, that was the point, right? I mean, get the thing that killed mom.

SAM

Yeah, yeah, uh, Dad. About Mom…

[MARY’s voice is heard from the hallway.]

MARY

Sam? Dean?

[JOHN looks shocked.]

JOHN

Mary?

[MARY walks into the kitchen. JOHN turns around and smiles at her. She walks over to him in shock, as he stands up from the table. She smiles at him, as he leans down to kiss her. They embrace each other as SAM and DEAN look on. SAM gestures for DEAN to leave the kitchen. The boys stand up from the table and leave.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER HALLWAY – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN walk down the hallway.]

DEAN

It’s Dad. This is amazing, man. I’m – I’m – I’m freaking out.

SAM

Yeah, I know. But, Dean – Dean, listen.

DEAN

What? What?

[They stop walking.]

SAM

How did this happen?

DEAN

I-I-I don’t know. You said that the – the pearl gives you what your heart desires, right? So, my heart desired – I – I’ve wanted this, man. I’ve – I’ve wanted this since I was 4 years old.

SAM

Okay, I know, and I-I-I-I love this, too, Dean. I do, honestly, but – but messing with time –

DEAN

No, no, no, Sam.

SAM

You know how this ends. Things change.

DEAN

Yeah, great – we got our family back together. I’ll take that change.

SAM

That’s not what I mean.

DEAN

Stop. Just stop, okay? Look, can – can we just have one family dinner? Just one? Us – all of us together. That’s all I want. Can you just give me that?

[DEAN walks away.]

SAM

Dean –

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[JOHN is looking through the books on the shelves. SAM walks in.]

JOHN

This place – I don’t even know.

SAM

Yeah, yeah. Uh, when we – we, uh, first moved in, I-I think it kind of blew our minds, too.

[JOHN smiles at SAM.]

SAM

Um, where’s – where’s mom?

JOHN

Oh, she’s, uh, gettin’ your brother a shopping list. She’s gonna make that casserole of hers.

[SAM laughs.]

SAM

Yeah, Dean and I tried to make that once.

JOHN

I, um… I remember. I screwed up with you a lot, didn’t I?

SAM

No, that’s okay.

JOHN

No, it’s not. Sammy, tell me the truth.

SAM

I don’t want to talk about that.

JOHN

You didn’t have a problem talking about it before you left.

SAM

Dad… for me? That fight… that was a lifetime ago. I don’t even remember what I said, and – I mean… yeah. You know what? You did some messed-up things. But I don’t… I mean, when I think about you… [voice breaks] and I think about you a lot… I don’t think about our – our fights. I think about you… I think about you on the floor of that hospital. And I think about how I never got to say goodbye.

[JOHN puts his hand on SAM’s shoulder.]

JOHN

Sam. Son. I am so sorry.

SAM

I’m sorry, too. But you did your best, dad. You – you fought for us, and you loved us, and… that’s enough.

[JOHN tearfully smiles at SAM and pats his shoulder.]

INTERIOR – HALLWAY – NIGHT

[MARY hands DEAN a piece of paper.]

DEAN

Okay.

[DEAN walks down the hallway.]

SAM

Dean, hold on. Hold on. Just…

DEAN

What?

SAM

Listen. You, um… you’re right. You want some company?

[DEAN smirks.]

EXTERIOR – HIGHWAY – NIGHT

[The Impala drives down the highway.]

EXTERIOR – LEBANON, KANSAS – NIGHT

[The Impala pulls up in front of the liquor store. SAM and DEAN get out.]

DEAN

Alright. I’ll get the booze – you get the food.

INTERIOR – LIQUOR STORE – NIGHT

[DEAN walks in.]

DEAN

Alright, Jackson. It’s celebration time. Give me your best stuff.

JACKSON

Uh, do I know you?

DEAN

It’s Dean. Campbell. I come in here, like, always.

JACKSON

Oh. Right.

[DEAN is confused.]

EXTERIOR – LEBANON, KANSAS – NIGHT

[SAM walks out of the grocery store. MAX walks past.]

SAM

Hey, Max.

[MAX looks up at him.]

MAX
Weirdo.

[SAM crosses the street and stops in front of the postal station. He waves at MARTA.]

SAM

Hi.

[MARTA closes the blinds. SAM shakes his head and walks down the street. He stops by a window, seeing a WANTED sign with DEAN’s face on it. He rushes back to the car.]

[DEAN is leaning against the car, looking at his phone.]

SAM

Dean. Dean, we have a problem.

DEAN

Yeah, yeah, we do. Check this out.

[DEAN shows SAM his phone. There’s a video of SAM wearing glasses and a turtleneck sweater, on the screen.]

SAM

Is that me?

DEAN

According to the internet, you run a law firm and love kale. Wait till you check your, uh, wannabe TED talk.

[DEAN starts the video.]

ALTERNATE SAM

Invest in a treadmill desk, don’t drink coffee, and stick to a raw food diet. I mean, God bless kale – am I right? Truth is –

SAM

Okay…

DEAN

No, no, it gets worse.

ALTERNATE SAM

And this is hard to hear – performing at your best requires all of your mental energy. Every last drop. You see, it’s just not compatible with something like, uh… hobbies or, uh – or even having a family.

SAM

Okay. That’s enough of that.

[SAM turns off the video.]

SAM

Listen, Dean, there is a wanted poster for you, hanging in the post office.

DEAN

Oh, yeah, no, I-I Googled me, as well. Um, lotta beheadings.

SAM

I was right – messing with time changed things.

DEAN

Well, I mean, I’m still hunting, but you’re internet famous. So, what – is there two of us running around here?

SAM

No, I don’t think so. I think it’s a temporal paradox. We pulled Dad here from 2003, right? So time is self-correcting. Our timeline is changing to this new one.

DEAN

So, what do you mean?

SAM

It means, I think, that, if we don’t fix this, then we become those other versions of ourselves. Like, for real.

DEAN

Okay, well, I’m cool, but you’re – ugh.

SAM

That’s not the point. The point is, if – if all this is different, then what else changed?

EXTERIOR – ALLEYWAY – NIGHT

[The wind picks up. A rustling of wings. ZACHARIAH is standing under the light of the street lamp. Another rustling of wings. ALTERNATE CAS walks over to him.]

ACT FOUR

EXTERIOR – ALLEYWAY – NIGHT

[ZACHARIAH steps in a puddle of water, burgers wrappers on the ground.]

ZACHARIAH

Earth – where you’re always stepping in something. Come on, Constantine.

[ALTERNATE CAS follows behind him.]

ALTERNATE CAS
I don’t understand that reference.

ZACHARIAH

You wouldn’t.

EXTERIOR – LEBANON, KANSAS – NIGHT

[DEAN and SAM stand near the Impala.]

DEAN

How are we gonna tell Dad?

SAM

I don’t know. How are we gonna tell Mom?

INTERIOR – RESTAURANT – NIGHT

[ZACHRIAH and ALTERNATE CAS walk in. ELIOT, STACY and MAX are sitting at one of the tables.]

CAITLIN

Can I help you?

ZACHARIAH

Bet you can. See, I need to know… who’s been messing with time.

CAITLIN

I’m sorry?

ZACHARIAH

Yeah, we sensed a – well, let’s call it a disturbance in the Force. And in Heaven, well, we’re – we’re not super fond of those.

CAITLIN

In Heaven?

ZACHARIAH

Yeah, yeah. In Heaven. This town – it’s always been a little… muddy for us. Some sort of… interference.

[ZACHARIAH sees the teens looking at him.]

ZACHARIAH

Hi. So, I’m going to ask one more time – who’s been playing “Back to the Future”? And you’re going to tell me, or he – [looks at ALTERNATE CAS] what’s the phrase I’m looking for? Oh – murders you all.

ALTERNATE CAS

My name is Castiel. I’m an Angel of the Lord.

[The lights crack. The teens gasp in fear. ALTERNATE CAS’s eyes flash blue, as the shadows of his wings appear, illuminating the room.]

EXTERIOR – LEBANON, KANSAS – NIGHT

DEAN

Let’s get out of here.

[SAM and DEAN turn to see light coming from the restaurant.]

SAM

What the hell?

[They rush towards the restaurant.]

INTERIOR – RESTAURANT – NIGHT

[CAITLIN and the teens gather around the table, scared. ALTERNATE CAS powers down. SAM and DEAN enter.]

DEAN

Get out! Go, go, go!

[CAITLIN and the teens run out of the restaurant.]

ZACHARIAH

The Winchesters?

SAM

Zachariah?

DEAN

Cas?

ZACHARIAH

Now, I-I-I know we had big plans for you, and then your daddy just up and disappeared, which… oh. You. This is all you.

DEAN

Cas, you know us.

ALTERNATE CAS

I don’t know you.

ZACHARIAH

Kill them.

[ALTERNATE CAS walks towards DEAN. DEAN takes out the angel blade.]

DEAN

Cas, don’t!

[ALTERNATE CAS punches DEAN and throws him over the counter. ZACHARIAH lifts his hand towards SAM, using his powers to choke him.]

ZACHARIAH

What did you do, Sam?

[SAM falls to his knees. DEAN picks up a cake stand that knocked over, and hits ALTERNATE CAS in the face with it, twice. ALTERNATE CAS ducks and throws DEAN against the wall.]

ZACHARIAH

What did you do? Sam. Speak, Ubu, speak.

[SAM is still choking.]

ZACHARIAH

What? What is it?

[SAM takes out the angel blade and stabs ZACHARIAH. His grace shines through him, as he screams. He falls to the floor, dead.]

[DEAN continues to fight ALTERNATE CAS. He punches ALTERNATE CAS in the face, as SAM tries to strike him with the angel blade. ALTERNATE CAS punches SAM and DEAN repeatedly, before throwing SAM into a table. He punches DEAN, and throws him against the shelves, as glasses break.]

[ALTERNATE CAS turns to SAM and hits his head against the table several times before punching SAM across the face. SAM falls to the floor.]

[ALTERNATE CAS walks over to DEAN and picks him up, grabbing his throat.]

DEAN

No. No, no, no, no, no, no!

[ALTERNATE CAS starts to choke DEAN. DEAN tries to push him away.]

DEAN

Cas. Cas. Stop it.

[A light fills the room, as ALTERNATE CAS screams. He vanishes. The light fades. SAM takes his hand off the sigil on the ground.]

ACT FIVE

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[The table is set with plates and glasses. JOHN and DEAN stand next to the table.]

JOHN

A “temporal paradox”?

DEAN

That’s what Sam’s calling it. Egghead.

[JOHN chuckles.]

DEAN

Basically, uh, if you don’t go back, Sam never gets back into the life, um, and Mom, she, uh…

JOHN

What?

DEAN

Well, without everything that we did – with God, The Darkness – she never comes back. Sam thinks that she’ll just fade away.

JOHN

Okay. I mean, me versus your mom? That’s – that’s not even a choice. Does she know?

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[MARY stands at the kitchen counter. SAM stands in front of her. She nods, crying.]

MARY

How?

SAM

Uh, the, uh… the lore is pretty clear. We destroy the pearl, and it unwinds all of this. Dad goes back… and so will everything else.

MARY

And he won’t remember anything?

[SAM shakes his head.]

SAM

No.

[MARY nods. She shakes her head, crying.]

MARY

Sam, I can’t.

SAM

I know. I know, Mom.

[The timer rings loudly.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

JOHN

You want to give your mom a hand?

DEAN

Yeah.

[DEAN starts to walk away.]

JOHN

Dean.

[DEAN turns back.]

JOHN

I, uh – I never meant for this.

DEAN

Dad, we pulled you here.

JOHN

No, son. My fight. It was supposed to end with me, with Yellow Eyes. But now you – you are a grown man, and I am incredibly proud of you. I guess that I had hoped, eventually, you would… get yourself a normal life, a peaceful life, a family.

[DEAN nods. He smiles.]

DEAN

I have a family.

[JOHN smiles.]

JOHN

Yeah. Alright. What’s next?

DEAN

We eat.

[DEAN leaves for the kitchen.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[SAM and DEAN sit across from JOHN and MARY. Everyone is quiet, as they eat in silence. JOHN looks at all of them.]

JOHN

Alright. Near as I can tell, we have two choices. Alright, we can think about what’s coming. Or we can be grateful for this time that we have together. Now, me…

[JOHN takes MARY’s hand.]

JOHN

I choose grateful.

[He kisses her hand.]

JOHN

So, to whatever brought us together, we owe you one. Amen.

DEAN

Amen.

MARY

Amen.

SAM

Amen.

[They all clink their glasses together and enjoy their meal, as “Till It Shines” by Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band plays over the scene.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER KITCHEN – NIGHT

[DEAN is washing the dishes. He passes them to SAM, who wipes them.]

SAM

Did you see them at dinner, the way they looked at each other? They just seemed happy, you know? It doesn’t feel fair to get all this and have to throw it away, and I know we have to. But it just feels like, you know… Once we send Dad back… it’s none of this ever happened. He – he just goes back to – to… to being Dad.

DEAN

You saying you wish things would be different?

SAM

Don’t you? Can you imagine – dad in the past, knowing then what he knows now? I… I think it would be nice.

DEAN

Yeah. I used to think that, too. But, uh… I mean, look, we’ve been through some tough times. There’s no denying that.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

And for the longest time, I blamed Dad. I mean, hell, I blamed Mom, too, you know? I was angry. But say we could send Dad back knowing everything. Why stop there? Why not send him even further back and let some other poor sons of bitches save the world? But here’s the problem. Who does that make us? Would we be better off? Well, maybe. But I gotta be honest – I don’t know who that Dean Winchester is. And I’m good with who I am. I’m good with who you are. ‘Cause our lives – they’re ours. And maybe I’m just too damn old to want to change that.

INTERIOR – BUNKER LIBRARY – NIGHT

[JOHN and MARY take each other’s hand.]

MARY

I hate this.

JOHN

So do I.

[SAM and DEAN stand across from them.]

JOHN

Okay.

[He turns to MARY.]

JOHN

My girl.

[MARY smiles through tears.]

JOHN

I miss you so damn much.

MARY

Me too.

[They kiss. MARY kisses JOHN’s cheek and hugs him, tightly. They pull away from each other, as JOHN turns to SAM and DEAN.]

JOHN

You two. You take care of each other.

SAM

We always do.

DEAN

Good to see you, Dad.

JOHN

Yeah. I am so proud of you boys.

[SAM tries to smile through tears.]

[JOHN pulls them both into a hug.]

JOHN

I love you both so much.

[SAM wipes his tears away with the back of his hand. DEAN cries.]

DEAN

I love you, too.

[JOHN sighs, breathing harshly. He pulls away from them.]

JOHN

Okay. Okay. I’m ready.

[JOHN takes MARY’s hand. He winks at her. He faces SAM.]

JOHN

Sammy.

[SAM picks up the pearl and puts it on the table. JOHN and SAM nod to each other. SAM picks up a bowl and brings it down. The pearl shatters. DEAN flinches at the sound. JOHN looks at MARY as he starts to vanish. His hand fades away from hers. MARY cries.]

EXTERIOR – LEBANON, KANSAS – NIGHT

[A shot of the town.]

INTERIOR – RESTAURANT – NIGHT

[The mess made from the fight disappears, the tables and chairs are back to their original place.]

EXTERIOR – LEBANON, KANSAS – NIGHT

[The WANTED poster of DEAN changes to a marathon sign.]

[ELIOT, STACY and MAX walk down the street.]

ELIOT

Monsters! Those guys hunt monsters! That is so cool.

[STACY and MAX laugh, as they take each other’s hand.]

INTERIOR – BUNKER – NIGHT

[CAS walks in from the door at the top of the stairs. SAM, DEAN and MARY walk out from the library to see him.]

CAS

Mary, Sam, Dean. What happened?

[SAM scoffs.]

SAM

What happened?

[SAM looks at DEAN.]

DEAN

Well, there’s a story.

EXTERIOR – LAKESIDE – DAY

[The Impala is parked near a lake. JOHN sleeps in the front seat. He’s back in 2003. His cell phone rings on the dashboard. He wakes up and answers the call.]

JOHN

Dean. No, I’m okay. I just… I just had one hell of a dream. Yeah. No, it was a good one. I’m on my way back. I’ll see you soon.

[JOHN ends the call.]
