EMERSON, MANITOBA; 1980

[young Asa is running through the woods, looking over his shoulder at something chasing him. He trips over a log and falls, and we see the werewolf who’d been chasing him capture him and pin him to a tree. The wolf scratches Asa’s face with a claw, snarling at Asa and preparing to tear out his heart, when a gunshot sounds and Asa’s face is spattered with blood. Mary has shot the werewolf and saved Asa. Mary then drives Asa home.]
Mary: So, this is your house?
[Asa nods, holding a cloth to the cut on his face]
Mary: Look, you did a great job of pointing directions, but words are helpful. And names. Like me? I’m Mary. Winchester.
Asa: Asa. Fox.
Mary: That’s a great name. You’re gonna be fine. I know it doesn’t seem like it, but you are.
Asa: What was that thing?
Mary: A werewolf. One I’ve been tracking for a long time. We had history. Come on.
[Mary gets out of the car, followed by Asa]
Asa: Werewolf? You kill werewolves?
Mary: I hunted a lot of bad things.
Asa: Hunted. Like past tense?
Mary: I’m retiring. Well, officially I’m already retired. I’m just tying up a few loose ends.
Asa: But if you retire, who’s gonna save people like me?
Mary: Uh, your mom in there?
[Asa nods, but looks away from Mary]
Mary: Good. Hey, let me just…
[Mary reaches out to tidy up Asa’s hair a little bit]
Mary: That’s better. Good enough. Well, go on.
[she watches Asa go home and waves; Asa turns and snaps a polaroid of Mary getting back into her car, which he tacks to his bulletin board]
[montage of Asa’s life and journey to becoming a hunter set to Bachman-Turner Overdrive’s Roll On Down The Highway, featuring the postcards he wrote but never sent to Mary]
[Asa’s working on his old Jeep]
Bucky: Hey, you know they make new cars, right?
Asa: I don’t want a new car. This is my lucky car.
[Asa’s running through the forest again, similar to the opening scene, but now it’s night and he’s chasing the monster now. As before, he ends up pinned to a tree, but this time he’s been hanged.]

TITLE CARD
ACT ONE


[interior of Jody Mills’ house, she brings a pizza and a glass of wine to the couch]

Jody: Aah, Netflix. What do you recommend to fill my day off? [singsongy] Speak to me.
[someone knocks at the door as soon as she turns the TV on. She sighs and answers the door. It’s Sam and Dean.]
Jody: Wow, you look terrible. What’s wrong?
Dean: Sure, we’d love to come in. [giving Jody and hug and entering the house]
Sam: Hey. [kissing Jody’s cheek and following Dean] Yeah, we just finished a hunt in Brookings.
Jody: And you couldn’t take a shower first?
Dean: Heh.
Sam: Ha ha. We figured we’d stop by on the way home and see you, Claire, and Alex.
Jody: Aw, that’s fun. Unfortunately the girls are in Omaha for the weekend being angsty at a Radiohead concert. But I can feed you.
Sam: Ooh,
Dean. Yes. Alright. Oh, uh… Since the last time we saw you? I killed Hitler.
Sam: Oh [rolls his eyes and walks off]
[Dean is very pleased with himself]
Jody: [perplexed] Thank you?
Dean: You’re welcome.

[romantic scene of a couple silhouetted against a sunset while sweeping music plays on Jody’s TV. The couple kisses.]
Dean: [his mouth full of pizza] Jody, you watching some kind of chick flick here?
Jody: Well, Dean. I’m a chick.
Dean: No. No, no. You’re– you’re a badass sheriff chick. You’re not a-a rom com chick. Wait, are you a rom com chick?
Jody: Are you?
Sam: [also with his mouth full] He’s more of a, uh… animated Japanese erotica chick.
Jody: [leaning forward in interest] Really?
[Dean glares at Sam and looks uncomfortable]
Sam. Mm-hmm.
[Jody’s phone rings in the other room and she stands up to answer it]
Jody: I need to leave this scintillating conversation.
[Sam chuckles]
Dean: [upset with Sam] Don’t tell her that.
Sam: Tell her what?
Dean: [still uncomfortable] It’s Jody, man.
Sam: Dude, be proud of your hobbies. It makes you who you are. [he laughs]
[Jody walks back through the room, clearly upset.]
Sam: Jody?

[Sam and Dean follow to her bedroom, where she’s packing some clothes]
Dean: Jody, what’s up?
Jody: [voice breaking] A friend of mine died.
Sam: Who?
Jody: Asa Fox.
Sam: [sighs deeply]
Dean: Asa Fox. Why does that name sound familiar?
Sam: Isn’t he the guy that Ellen used to tell stories about back at the Roadhouse?
Dean: Yeah. Supposedly he killed, like, five wendigos in a night.
Jody: Yeah. Yeah, he was a hunter. He, uh. He rolled into town a few months back, tr-tried to convince me he was FBI Agent Fox Mulder. He was chasing a pack of ghouls and I helped. He’d pass through every once in a while after that, and we’d grab co… coffee or… something.
[whispering] Oh, he was a good man.
[her voice breaks] The… the wake’s tonight, and, um. They’re gonna salt and burn the body tomorrow.
I can’t believe I just said that like it’s something normal.
Dean: Well, we’re gonna come with you.
Sam: Yeah.
Jody: You don’t have… I’ll be fine.
Sam: Yeah, no, Jody. We… we know you’ll be fine, but… you know, we never go to hunter gatherings, outside of bars. Dad always said they were trouble, so…
Dean: Yes, you’d be doing us a favor if you let us tag along.
Jody: Thank you. You’re gonna have to get cleaned up before we spend five hours in the car together. Yeah.
Dean: Five hours? Where, uh, where we going?

[The Impala drives past a sign welcoming them to Emerson, Manitoba while Alice In Chains’ Man In The Box plays, and the Impala pulls up outside Asa Fox’s home]

Dean: O, Canada.
Sam: That is a big house.
[Music continues playing, coming from inside the house now]
Jody: Family home. Asa was just a guy.

[Inside the music is louder, and a large crowd of people is mingling, laughing, and drinking, when Jody, Dean, and Sam enter. Lorraine Fox, Asa’s mother, comes over to greet Jody with a hug.]

Lorraine: Jody! Oh, Jody, thanks for comin'.
Jody: Mmm. Loraine, of course. How you holding up?
Lorraine: Well, it’s a house full of LOUD, drunk hunters, and my son’s dead body is in the parlor. But I haven’t slit my wrists yet. Small victories.
Sam: We’re very sorry for your loss.
Lorraine: I know. Everyone’s sorry. [Lorraine wanders off]
Jody: So… this is gonna be fun.

[Jody removes her coat and the three of them begin mingling. Dean finds his way to the kitchen and a cooler full of beer]

Dean: No label. Well, that’s a red flag.
Bucky: Nah, fully safe. I homebrewed it myself. [Bucky takes the bottle from Dean and opens it for him] Here. Not a twist off.
Dean: Ah.
Bucky: Oh, hope you like strong beer, buddy.
[Dean tries the beer]
Dean: That’s good.
Bucky: Ah?
Dean: Uh, Dean Winchester.
Bucky: The Dean Winchester?
[a man sitting at the nearby table overhears this and joins the conversation]
Randy: No freakin’ way. Aren’t you dead? Like, four times?
Dean: Yeah. It, uh, didn't take.
[another man at the table joins the conversation]
Elvis: Wait. Your brother here? Sam?
Dean: Yeah, he's still alive, too. He's –
[Elvis doesn’t even wait for Dean to finish talking before he’s out of his seat and running off to find Sam]
Dean: Oh. Okay. Good talk.
Bucky: Yeah, sorry about Elvis. He's, uh...Elvis. I'm Bucky Sims. [he offers a hand for Dean to shake]
Dean: Hey.
Bucky: Yeah.
Randy: Randy. Randy Bull. Ah! [he mimics bull horns with his fingers] Watch out for the horns, right?
Dean: Hey. Uh, you two hunters?
Bucky: Mm hmm.
Randy: Yes sir. Did you know Asa?
Dean: No, no. I never met him. But, uh, heard some crazy stories.
Randy: Yeah, like what?
Dean: Well, I mean come on. Nobody can take out five wendigos in a night.
Bucky: Hey! Our famous friend said the magic word. Drink, everybody.
[everybody drinks and Dean is confused]
Dean: “Wendigo?” Is that, uh...
Bucky: Do it again.
[everybody drinks again]
Dean: Okay.
Randy: Stop saying that or we’re not gonna make it to morning.
Dean: Didn’t know the rules.
Bucky: You think the stories about Asa are crazy, you should hear what they say about you.
[Dean looks like he’s suddenly not enjoying the party very much anymore]

[Sam in the living room, talking with two young hunters, Max and Alicia]
Sam: Wait, so you guys were raised by a witch, but you're Hunters?
Max and Alicia in unison: Yep.
Max: She was, like, a good witch. Very Enya. It was the 90’s.
Alicia: Lots of crystals.
Max: Mm hmm.
Alicia: She taught me to hunt witches. Uh, bad witches.
Sam: Sure. And what did she teach you?
Max: Uh, mostly how to seduce men.
Alicia: She also taught him some magic, which is actually more useful.
Max: Eh, mostly the men thing.
Alicia: [laughing] Max!
[Elvis butts into their conversation]
Elvis: Are you Sam Winchester? You are, right? Oh, this is nuts. Wow. Hi.
Sam: [uncomfortable] Hey.
Elvis: Uh, Elvis. Um. Katz. [he shakes Sam’s hand] Wow. Look, so thing is, I got this friend down in the States, right, who knows this girl who knew your pal Garth.
Sam: Garth. Right.
Elvis: And, well, he said that she said that Garth said that you were possessed by the Devil? Like, Lucifer. The actual big, bad Devil, and you lived?
[Sam becomes more and more uncomfortable]
Max and Alicia in unison: [appalled] Whoa.
Alicia: Dude, you don't just ask someone about something that messed up.
Max: Seriously, back off.
Elvis: But it's pretty amazing, huh?
Sam: N– It – it's really not that amazing. It – it just kind of is what it is. Um… I'm gonna get a-a beer. Yeah, you good? Yeah? Good.
[Sam gets up and leaves quickly]
[Elvis takes an interest in Max and Alicia, and squeezes in with them on the couch]
Elvis: So, what’s your guys’ deal?
Max: Could...could you, like, go away from us now?
[Max and Alicia shoo Elvis off]

[Dean is in Asa’s office and finds an angel blade mounted on blue velvet inside an ornate glass-lidded box. He opens it, reaches in and pulls out the angel blade, comfortably spinning it in his hand when Sam walks in.]
Sam: Hey.
Dean: Oh, hi. This is a real Angel Blade. I mean, this guy was legit.
Sam: Did you know people tell stories about us?
Dean: Yeah. Apparently we’re a little bit legendary.
Sam: Yeah, but, I mean, so was Asa. Then a hunt went bad, and he ended up hanging from a tree, alone in the woods.
Dean: He died on the job. No better way to go.
Sam: You really believe that?
Dean: Yeah. What, you don’t? I mean, come on, Sam, it's not like we're in the “live till you're 90, die in your sleep” business. This? [Dean points at Asa’s hunting wall] This only ends one way.
Sam: We should get back.
Dean: Yeah. Oh, uh, don’t say “wendigo” to anyone.

[The party is ending and guests are leaving, the remaining guests gather in the living room to tell more stories]
Bucky: [we join him mid-story] And Asa made us go roller skating. And right after these ghouls almost got us. So there’s the three of us, all banged up, with a ton of ironic teenagers skating under these neon lights. You remember this, Jody?
Jody: Mm hmm.
Bucky: Oh, it was classic. I mean, you know, until the two of you snuck off for some sweet, sweet time alone.
Elvis: Ooooh!
Dean: “Sweet, sweet time alone?”
Sam: You, Jody? You didn’t tell us you were in a relationship with Asa.
Jody: Oh, it was just… it was just a casual thing. [She glances to Asa’s mother] Sorry, Lorraine.
Lorraine: Asa was always popular with the ladies.
Men: Yes, he was.
Max: Our mom loved him. She used to talk about him all the time.
Lorraine: See?
Jody: And, you know, I do have a life when you guys aren’t around.
Randy: Beer, anyone?
Sam: I’m good.
Elvis: Yeah.
[Randy heads to the kitchen for another beer]
Jody: And, uh. Here’s a news flash. Dating is hard. It’s not like I just turn into a boring, small-town sheriff when you guys are gone. I do stuff.
[Randy is attacked and his throat slit on his way back from the kitchen. A hand reaches out of the dark and grabs him, then we see Alicia returning to the living room with two beers]
Jody: You shouldn’t be surprised that I’d enjoy the company of a ruggedly hot man.
Alicia: Amen to that.
[The front door opens and someone steps inside the house]
Dean: Hey, you clearly deserve your sweet, sweet time alone.
Jody: Well, I mean, it wasn’t always sweet.
Dean: Uh… yeah, it’s just not how we think of you. You know, I…
Jody: Good, 'cause that would honestly be weird.
Dean: Nobody… nobody said you can’t date, right?
[Lorraine notices the newcomer by the door and calls out to them]
Lorraine: Come on in, don’t hover.
[Everyone turns to see the newcomer is Mary Winchester]
Mary: Sorry, I knocked.
[awkward shuffling by all]
Dean: Hi.

ACT TWO


[Mary, Dean, Sam, and Jody step out in the front hall for a more private discussion]
Mary: What are you doing here?
Dean: What are you doing here?
Sam: We, uh… [clears throat] Asa was a friend of a friend. Uh, friend of Jody’s. Jody, Mary. Mom, this is Jody Mills.
Jody: Mom? Mom. Wait, m– your mom?
Sam: Yeah.
Jody: I thought– I thought you were...
Mary: I was.
Jody: [quietly] Wow.
W-wow!
[Jody hugs Mary excitedly] It is so nice to meet you.
Wow!
[Jody senses the tension]
I'm gonna...I'm j– I'm gonna give you guys some, um, some family time.
[she leaves the three Winchesters alone to talk]
Mary: Wow.
Dean: Where you been?
Mary: All over. I went back to Lawrence for a few days. And then, um, I’ve been using John’s journal to retrace a few things. Try to catch up on what I’ve missed.
Dean: You could’ve just asked us, you know.
Sam: Dean, come on.
Dean: She could’ve.
Mary: It’s okay. He’s right. But… This is something I needed to do alone. I… Listen, most of the people I knew are dead. And then I remembered Asa. He was so young when I met him, I thought he must still be around. And then… I saw an article about his death, and, uh…
Dean: So you’ll text us once a week, maybe, but you’ll drive all the way to Canada to see some dead guy?
Well, that’s awesome. I’m gonna get some air.
Mary: Dean, wait...
[Dean walks toward the front door, where he’s met by Jody]
Jody: Hey.
Dean: Hey.
Jody: You okay?
Dean: Swell.
Jody: Huh. Is that why you spent the entire ride up here telling me in extreme, excruciating detail how you killed Hitler, but, uh, you neglected to mention the fact that your mom is back from the dead?
Dean: Yeah, no big deal.
Jody: That’s a lie.
Dean: Jody…
Jody: Look, maybe this isn't my place, and this is epic stuff, but, you know, if I could have my son and my husband back? I mean really back? I would give anything, absolutely anything to have that. And it would scare the hell out of me.
Dean: Yeah?
Jody: Yeah. Because what if I’ve changed. What if they changed? What if it just didn’t work out the way I wanted?
If you wanna talk about anything, absolutely anything, I’m here.
Dean: Thanks, Jody.

[Mary picks a beer out of the cooler in the kitchen, when Lorraine walks in]
Lorraine: Asa’s favorite. Tastes awful. I’m Lorraine Fox. Asa’s mom.
Mary: Mary Winchester.
Lorraine: No you’re not. Asa told me about you, but… you’d be my age. So how…
Mary: It’s a long story.
Lorraine: I’ll bet.
Mary: I’m sorry–
Lorraine: You should be. Like I said, Asa told me about you. You’re the reason my son didn’t become an astronaut.
Mary: Astronaut?
[Lorraine hands Mary a wooden box filled with Asa’s postcards he’d written to Mary]
Lorraine: Here. Asa wrote those to you over the years, but couldn’t send them because you’re so mysterious.
Mary: I saved his life.
Lorraine: [scoffing] What am I supposed to say to that? After you, Asa got so… Hunting was his whole life. He never married. Never had a family, kids. And now… enjoy the wake.
[Sam finds Mary leaving the kitchen with the box]
Sam: Hey.
Mary: Hey.
Sam: Everything all right?
Mary: I’m fine. [she shoves the box into Sam’s hands and walks off to Asa’s office, followed by Sam] It’s fine.
Sam: Are you sure?
Mary: I saved Asa when he was a boy. All of this, it’s on me.
Sam: Well, no. Obviously, mom, he made his own decisions. And he helped a lot of people, you know?
Mary: Yeah, I just don’t know anymore. Everywhere I go, and everything I do just… feels wrong. But I’ll get used to it. Being back here. I will. I just…
Sam: Yeah, mom. You don’t have to explain anything. I get it. You need space. And– and so does Dean, you know? I-I mean, he – he's just… We just got you back, [Sam continues while we see Dean outside drinking from his flask] and he's just scared we're gonna lose you again, that – that because we're hunters, you're gonna walk away. But I know that’s not true. Even looking at these…
[Sam holds out the box of Asa’s postcards to Mary]
I mean, you saved Asa in 1980, um, after Dean was born. After everyone thought you quit hunting. Seems like you couldn’t stop then, and… I’m guessing you can’t stop now, either. This job, this life, is crazy and insane. But it’s in our blood.
Come on. [Sam sets his arm around Mary’s shoulders]
Mary: Where we going?
Sam: To say goodbye to Asa.

[They walk into the room where Asa’s body is laid out under a shroud, and Mary pulls it back so she can see Asa’s face. While they’re standing there, blood drips down onto Asa’s forehead. Sam looks confused, then he and Mary look up at the ceiling, where Randy is bound to the rafters, dead.]

[Back in the living room, the stories are continuing]
Bucky: And Asa loved that Jeep. Fuses were shorted, fuel line was busted. Ah, he didn’t care. He’d just roll up his sleeves, he’d get right to work.
[Sam and Mary dash into the room]
Sam: Guys, we need to leave. Now.
Jody: Sam?
Sam: Randy’s dead.
Alicia: What happened?
Mary: Someone gutted him and roped him to the ceiling. That’s what happened.
[Elvis returns to the room]
Elvis: Anyone know why the water’s shut off? God, what’s that smell?
Max and Alicia in unison: Sulfur.
[lights flicker]
Mary: It’s a demon.
Sam: Yeah.
Bucky: It’s him.
Sam: Him?
Bucky: Jael. He’s a crossroads demon. And he hangs people. It’s his thing. Snaps their neck, slits their throat. He’s a real piece of work.
Sam: Hanging? Like with Asa?
Bucky: He’s the one that killed him.
[Bucky tries to open the front door, but it’s sealed. Elvis tries to help, but they only get it open an inch before it slams shut again.]
Bucky: Son of a bitch.
Let me.
Max: You’re wasting your time.
[Max waves his hand over the door illuminating glowing red sigils]
The whole house has been warded, inside and out.
Jody: What does that mean?
Alicia: It means we’re trapped.

[Outside, Dean’s still leaning against a car and fiddling with his flask. Someone approaches him from behind]
Dean: Go away.
Billie: You’re not the boss of me.
[Dean turns around to see Billie the reaper]
Dean: Billie. What’re you doing here?
Billie: My job.
[Dean chuckles]
Dean: Well, I’m not dead yet.
Billie: Shame. But actually, I just finished inside. I was reaping a fresh soul.

[Back inside, everyone else is trying to figure out what’s going on]
Bucky: Look, back in ‘97, Asa was working on this case in Yellow Knife, all right? A possession of a First Nations girl. Got real bad, real bloody.
Sam: Was it, uh, Jael?
Bucky: Asa exorcised him, but not before Jael killed the girl. He made her tie a noose around her neck and he made Asa watch.

[Outside Dean is banging on the door, trying to get inside]
Dean: Sam. Sammy! Hey!
Billie: You can huff and puff, but that house is on supernatural lockdown. They can’t even hear you.

[Inside nobody knows that Dean’s trying to get through the door behind them]
Bucky: All right. An exorcism ain’t like an angel blade.
Sam: Yeah, it’s not permanent.
Bucky: Exactly. Right, so five years later, Jael– he came back, and he came for Asa.
Jody: How so?
Bucky: Asa was seeing this woman, right? She had a kid.
Lorraine: Marlene.
Bucky: Yeah, Marlene.
[Dean is still trying to break down the door from the outside]
Bucky: Jael got into her. It didn’t matter that he was killing people, he wanted Asa to know it was personal. He gets off on it.
[Dean picks up a statue on the porch and bashes it against the front door]
Sam: Yeah, and now he’s here. Possessing someone.
Mary: Yeah, but who?
Elvis: Alicia wasn’t in the room when Randy died. The rest of us were.
Alicia: I was getting a drink.
Max: Dean wasn’t in the room either.
Bucky: So it’s Alicia or Dean.
[Everyone looks at Alicia]
Alicia: I’m not! Throw some holy water on me, see what happens.
Sam: [patting down his jacket for a flask and coming up empty] Anybody packin’?
Elvis: We can just make more.
Mary: Uh, no we can’t. The water’s off.
Elvis: She knew it. [he points at Alicia] You knew that.
Alicia: Oh, come on.

[Dean finally stops futilely attacking the door and turns to Billie]
Dean: What did you do?
Billie: It wasn’t me. I don’t get my hands dirty. Rules. I just clean up the mess. Still, between us, it’s always nice to see a Winchester who can’t get what he wants.
Dean: You think this is funny? Huh? Hunters are dying in there.
Billie: Everyone dies.

[Inside again, Sam is sensible.]
Sam: I think Dean’s still outside.
Mary: That does narrow it…
[Alicia coughs]
… down.
[Max slowly walks over to Alicia]
Max: Alicia?
[Alicia giggles]
Alicia/Jael: Alicia’s not here right now. [Her eyes glow red] Leave a message. [she punches Max]
Oh, you’re a fun group. We’re gonna have a good time tonight.
[Jael leaves Alicia in a cloud of demon smoke and flies into the fireplace]
Elvis: It’s gone.
Max: Alicia, are you…
Sam: It’s not gone. It’s just not in Alicia anymore. Lorraine, is there anyone else in the house?
Lorraine: I don’t know. People have been coming and going all day.
Jody: Okay, we’re gonna pair off, we’re gonna search the house– for people, not for demons. If you find the demon, yell. We’ll find you. And if your partner gets possessed, run.
Sam: Mom. [he cocks his head asking Mary to follow him]
Jody: [to Bucky] Come on.
[Elvis helps Lorraine to sit and tells her to stay there]

[Dean is still outside with Billie]
Dean: You got in there. You got in there to reap that soul. You can get me in.
Billie: I could, I suppose. But–
Dean: Do it!
Billie: But it’s a one-way ticket. And you’re gonna owe me one.

[Inside, Elvis returns to Lorraine with a drink]
Elvis: I got you a double.
[Lorraine takes a sip when suddenly the front door glows incredibly bright and then Dean tumbles through the door and rolls into the room]
Lorraine: Holy…
Dean: Where’s my brother.
[Dean storms off, knife drawn, in search of Sam, but Elvis stops him]
Elvis: Hey, hold up! How did you…
Lorraine: He’s the demon!
Dean: Demon?
Lorraine: Kill him!
Dean: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, lady. Look, I’m not a demon, okay? I’m one of the good guys. Now stick with me, do what I say, and everybody’ll get out of here, okay? Everybody.
Elvis/Jael: Well, not everybody.
[Elvis pulls a knife and his eyes flash red]
ACT THREE


[Elvis attacks Dean with the knife, but Dean easily evades him.]
Dean: You’re kinda slow for a demon, aren’t you?
Elvis/Jael: Careful, now. You’ll hurt my feelings, and I might lash out.
[Dean easily dodges another attack]
Dean: How about you go to Hell?
Elvis/Jael: Please. It’s a complete train wreck down there. No Lucifer, no Crowley. It’s messy.
[Dean dodges yet another attack]
Dean: No, I mean really. Go to hell.
[Dean begins reciting an exorcism]
Elvis/Jael: An exorcism? Unh-unh. Elvis is leaving the building.
[Jael snaps Elvis’ neck and then smokes out up the stairs while Lorraine screams, and Dean helps her away]
Dean: Come on. Come on. Come on. Sammy!
[Mary and Sam find Dean and Lorraine in the living room]
Dean: Hey.
Mary: Dean. We thought you were outside.
Dean: Yeah, I got back in.
Sam: How?
Dean: It was a one-time deal. Won’t happen again.
[he looks around at the assembled crowd]
Is this everybody?
Jody: Except for Elvis.
Dean: Yeah, demon got him.
[The lights go out, and everyone reaches for flashlights and lighters, except for Dean, who pulls out the demon killing knife]
Alicia: Well, at least we’re all prepared.
Dean: Yep.
Alicia: Mm, impressive.
Dean: Demon blade. Kills ‘em dead.
Max and Alicia in unison: Nice.
Bucky: We gotta light some candles.
Dean: A devil’s trap.
[Sam springs into action, and Dean’s right behind him]
Sam: On it.
Dean: Yep
[They clear away the furniture and begin lighting candles]
Mary: All right, uh, but how are we gonna lure it inside?
Dean: We’re not. We get in. Everybody’s in, everybody’s clean. If someone won’t get in…
Mary: They’re the demon.
Dean: That’s right.
Mary: Smart.
Dean: Thanks.

[Mary sneaks off to Asa’s office to borrow his angel blade]

[Sam is drawing out the devil’s trap in ashes on the floor]
Max: What kind of devil’s trap?
Sam: Standard pentagram. Nothing fancy.
Max: I like a Fifth Pentacle of Mars. It’s got more character.
Alicia: Because character is really what matters right now.

[Jody sees Mary returning to the living room, and crouches down beside Sam, whispering to him]
Jody: Sam… This is awkward, I’m owning that. But the demon… I think it’s in your mom.
Sam: She looks okay to me.
Jody: I may not know much, but I know people don’t “look” possessed. No, I saw her sneak out of the room when you started talking about the devil’s trap. Where did she go? I mean, I know she’s family, but, Sam…
[Dean notices them talking quietly, pulls out the demon knife and joins them]
Dean: What’s going on?
Sam: Jody thinks that mom–
Jody: [yelling] No, I don’t think, I know. I know she’s a demon.
[Bucky steps away from Mary and goes for his knife]
Mary: Hey.
Jody: Kill her! Use the knife! Kill her now!
Sam: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Hold on a second, Jody, you… You don’t sound like yourself.
Dean:That’s because she’s not herself. Are you?
[Jody’s eyes flash red and she laughs]
Jody/Jael: Can’t blame a girl for tryin’.

ACT FOUR


Jody/Jael: I had so hoped you’d kill your mom. Wouldn’t that be a riot?
Dean: Yeah, super fun.
Sam: No,
[Sam tries to tackle Jody/Jael and she throws him across the room. Dean tries, and she throws him too]
Jody/Jael: Anybody else? Nope? Fine.
[Mary draws the angel blade and charges at Jody. She cuts Jody’s arm before Sam wrestles her away.]
Sam: No! Mom!
Mary: What are you doing?! She’s a demon. We kill demons.
Sam: No, but she’s Jody.
Jody/Jael: Boring.
[she claps her hands and everyone falls to the ground, immobilized, and she kicks the angel blade away]
Jody/Jael: Oh, I have heard so many stories about you Winchesters. And I desperately want the Lucifer thing to be true.
[She climbs carefully around the devil’s trap to stand over Sam]
The idea that he left a meatsuit alive is just so deliciously weak.
[She stands up and looks around at the rest of the people on the floor]
As for the rest of you, I have been inside your heads. I know all about you. For example, the twins. Too frightened to tell anyone that they actually came to say goodbye to their daddy.
[Lorraine looks up from the floor in shock, realizing that the twins are actually her grandchildren]
Or the grieving mother who hated the fact that her son was a hunter so much she’d hide his gear, she’d sabotage his Jeep, anything to keep him from hunting. Not that it worked. Could’ve tried harder, huh?
[She gestures at her own face]
And this meatsuit you all seem to care so much about. She actually fantasized about a life with Asa. Can you believe that? Like that worthless man–
[Bucky gets off the floor and sneaks up behind Jody/Jael]
Bucky: Shut your filthy mouth.
[Jody/Jael grabs Bucky by the neck and forces him to his knees]
Jody/Jael: And you. Bucky. Brave, brave Bucky. I was there that night. Tell these nice, stupid people what you did. Tell them what you took from me. Asa was mine.
[Sam manages to get to his feet and starts chanting the exorcism]
Jody/Jael: No!
[Jody/Jael throws Sam back across the room]
[Dean picks up the exorcism where Sam left off, but Jody/Jael throws him through a glass door]
Jody/Jael: [to Bucky] Tell them!
[Max and Alicia continue the exorcism and are pinned to the wall]
Bucky: Aah! I killed him! I killed him. I killed Asa.
[Jody/Jael throws Bucky to the floor, but Mary completes the exorcism and Jael is sent to Hell]
Sam: Jody. Jody, are you okay?
Jody: That... sucked.
Lorraine: Bucky, what did you do?

ACT FIVE


Bucky: Asa, he was just all– he was just always so stubborn. Look, we were in the woods.
[We see the scene play out as Bucky describes it]
Jael, he… he was taunting him. Asa wanted to chase him, but he didn’t have the angel blade. I said, “Let’s go back.” He called me a coward, and he shoved me, so I shoved him back, and he fell. He hit his head.
Asa?
I didn’t mean to do it. But it was a mistake.
Asa. Asa?
An accident. I’m sorry. I didn’t know what to do. Asa hated that damn demon so much that I just…
Dean: Oh, you thought people would buy that Jael killed him? So you hung your best friend to cover your own ass.
Bucky: What are you gonna do to me?
Alicia: Tell everyone, every hunter we meet. They’re gonna know your name, Bucky. Know what you did.
Max: You like stories. This is the story everyone’s gonna tell about you. Forever.

[Outside the following morning, gathered around the pyre where Asa, Randy, and Elvis are burning. Jody, Mary, and Lorraine are standing together.]
Lorraine: I was wrong. Asa did have a family. He even had kids. I’ve got grandchildren. Suppose I should go meet them.
[she walks over to stand with Max and Alicia]
Mary: Sorry.
Jody: I’ve had worse.
[Jody takes a long look over at Sam and Dean standing together by the Impala]
I don’t know what’s going on between you and your boys, but I gotta tell you, mom to mom, they are good men. Best I’ve ever met.
Mary: I know. They’re not the problem.
[Jody walks away, and Sam and Dean come over to Mary’s side.]
Dean: Mom.
Sam: You okay?
[Billie appears through the smoke on the other side of the pyre]
Billie: She’s really not.
Sam: Billie.
Mary: Who’s…
Dean: She’s a reaper. She’s the one that got me back inside.
Billie: And now you owe me one.
[Billie turns her gaze on Mary]
This one. This one right here.
Mary: What?
Billie: See, I’m a big believer in what dies, stays dead. Laws of the universe and all that, so…
Mary: I didn’t ask to come back here.
Billie: No, you didn’t. And you hate it. The look in your eyes, I’ve seen it before. It’s a dead man’s look– eyes that say no matter where you go or what you do, it feels like this world doesn’t fit anymore. Like you’re all alone.
Dean: Well, she’s not alone.
Billie: Tell me I’m wrong. I’m not here to hurt you. I’m here to offer you mercy. A one-way ticket upstairs, away from all of this.
Mary: How would it work?
Sam: Mom.
Mary: You just kill me again?
Billie: Reapers don’t kill people. Rules.
Mary: Well… then…
[she looks up at Sam and Dean]
Then I guess you’re just gonna have to wait.
Billie: Winchesters. If you change your mind– if any of you change your minds– you know my name.
[Billie disappears]
Sam: Does this mean you’re coming home?
Mary: Yeah. Not quite yet. I just need a little more time.
Dean: Can we buy you breakfast at least?
Mary: Bacon?
Dean: All the bacon.
Mary: I would love that.
[They walk off together toward the Impala]
