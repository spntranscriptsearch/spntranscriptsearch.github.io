Teaser
Grand Junction, Colorado

Two teenage boys approach an abandoned house and climb over the chain link fence, each handing the other a video camera to hold while climbing over.
Evan: You got a full battery?
Shawn: [Nervously checks camera] Yep.
Evan: You ready?
Shawn: Yeah.
Using flashlights and the video cameras, the two boys cross the large yard. Shawn holds camera up and is recording Evan.
Evan: We are going to get so many hits!
Shawn continues to record Evan with the camera as they enter the house.
Shawn: I can’t believe I’m doing this.
Evan: What?
Shawn: Are you sure about this?
Flashlight shines on the sign of the Dr. A Meadows Mental Health Center.
Evan: Come on, man! It’ll be awesome!
Flashlights continue to shine on warning signs that read “Keep Out” and “No Trespassing”. The boys enter the abandoned building and start to look around using flashlights.
Evan: I told you it’d be unlocked.
Shawn: Why would they leave it open?
Evan: Who’s “they”? Come on, no one even pretends to own this place, not after…
Shawn: Whatever. Don’t start.
Evan: What, you don’t want to hear about the guy who used to cut open people’s skulls?
Shawn: [rolling eyes] Sure. Of course he did, Evan.
Evan: No, seriously. He got arrested.
Shawn: So if he cuts your skull open, will you shut your stupid mouth?
Evan scoffs and returns to exploring building. Evan ascends a large staircase.
Shawn: Why do we have to go up there?
Evan: Uh-oh. Someone’s scared
Shawn: I’m not scared. I just… Mike punked out. At least I showed up.
Evan: Good. If you’re so brave, let’s look around.
Both boys continue to ascend the stairs. They find a ward full of neatly made hospital beds.
Evan: Where he kept his patients.
The boys continue down a corridor. Shawn stops
Shawn: Evan, I don’t like this, man.
Evan: [turning to face Shawn with the camera] Quit your whining
The boys continue down the corridor and Evan stops in front of a room and turns to face Shawn.
Shawn: So… Yeah, I’m not going in there.
Evan: Fine. Be a little baby.
The room is an examination room. Evan turns to Shawn
Evan: Come on, man. [Shawn enters the room and they continue to explore] Told ya. This guy was freaky.
A flashlight shines across a series of masks with bird-like beaks
Shawn: Evan. Come check this out.

Evan begins to examine the masks
Evan: Holy crap. [Picking one up, to Shawn] Put it in your bag.
Shawn: What? No.
Evan: Dude, nut up.
Shawn: Fine, just… hurry.
Evan places the mask in Shawn’s backpack. Creaking is heard nearby
Shawn: What was that?
Evan: Nothing. It was just a weird, like, house noise. Or the wind.
Shawn rapidly leaves the room. A loud bang is heard.
Shawn: Yeah, I’m out. [Nervously]
Evan: Shawn, come one, don’t be—
Louder creaking from overhead and whispering sounds spook both boys and they start to run towards the front door.
Evan: Go! Keep moving! Come on! Let’s go!
The boys continue to run down the stairs but stop at the sight of a man wearing an old doctor’s coat, an apron, and one of the bird masks, holding a large whirring drill
Man: Where is Dr. Meadows?
The man charges at the boys, throwing Shawn into the corner and faces off with Evan
Evan: No! No!
As the whirring continues we see Evan drop to the floor as seen through the video camera. The whirring continues as we see the man kneeling over Evan. Shawn escapes through the front door and runs across the yard, hearing Evan screaming in the background.
Act 1
MoL Bunker kitchen. Dean is making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Sam enters the kitchen.
Sam: Hey
Dean: Hey
Sam: PB&J for breakfast? Strong work.
Dean: Yep.
Sam: You want a beer with that?
Dean: I’m cool?
Sam: Come on, live a little. Here. [Places bottle of beer from fridge in front of Dean]
Dean: What’s going on with you?
Sam: What do you mean? [Awkward pause] Anyway, check this out. I think I found something.
Sam places iPad showing police report in front of Dean.
Sam: Three days ago, kid named Shawn Raider was found wandering the side of the road near Grand Junction, Colorado, bleeding from the head. Best friend was missing. And get this – only word he said? “Monster.”
Dean: Okay. Well, that sounds like something.
Sam: Yeah. So I thought we’d check it out, you and me.
Dean: What about Jack?
Sam: He’s uh, he’s catching up on all of my old fantasy DVDs – Red Sonja, Beastmaster, uh, Beastmaster II – you know, with the time traveling ferrets.
Dean: Yeah. Wow, how you ever got laid, I’ll never know.
Sam: Yeah, tell me about it. So I was thinking we’d leave Jack behind.
Dean: Really?
Sam: Yeah. We’ll put up some extra warding. He’ll be fine. I mean, when’s the last time we worked a case, just you and me?
Dean: It’s been a while.
Sam: Exactly. So?
Dean nods approvingly and we cut to a scene of the Impala pulling up to the curb in front of a house. Sam and Dean exit the car dressed in Fed threads. Sam hands Dean a badge.
Sam: Here
Dean opens it and checks the name
Dean: Agent Page? I thought you always liked to be Agent Page.
Sam: Yeah, well, changing it up.
The boys knock on the door and it is answered by Penny Raider, Shawn’s mother
Penny: May I help you?
Dean: Yeah, sorry to bother you ma’am. [The boys show their badges] Agents Page and Plant. FBI.
Sam: We’re here to follow up on the incident with your son.
Penny: Well, the police have already been here. Shouldn’t you talk to them?
Sam: We did, but we’d like to talk with you as well. And Shawn.
Penny shifts back and forth nervously.
Dean: Something wrong?
Penny: Shawn, he….won’t talk. He can’t.
Sam: What do you mean?
Penny: The doctors say…he’s okay physically, that it’s psychological. You know, trauma, like he…he…saw some – saw something so…awful. God I don’t even know what he was doing out that late.
We see Shawn, bandage over his left eye, in his bedroom intensely drawing. A knock at his door. Dean enters.
Dean: Shawn? Hey I’m Dean. I heard you had a rough time. You wanna tell me about it?
Shawn does not look directly at Dean and continues his drawing. Dean notices the drawings which are of the bird-like masks the boys saw in the building. We cut to Sam and Penny in the kitchen having coffee.
Penny: And, uh, Evan, he’s still missing. Uh… He, Shawn, and their friend Mike Ramos, they’re inseparable.
Sam: So, has anyone spoken with Mike?
Penny: Everyone. He says he doesn’t know what happened, but…
Sam: But you don’t believe him.
Penny: [Shaking her head no] Those boys do everything together. I just…I just – I just don’t know.
Back in Shawn room, Dean is looking at the pictures Shawn has drawn.
Dean: What is that? A monster? Is that the one you told the cops about?
Shawn stops drawing briefly, indicating to Dean that he was correct.
Dean: You know…. I know what it’s like to see monsters. And I know that even when they’re gone, they never really go away. You see ‘em when you close your eyes. You see ‘em in your dreams. But you know what? Me and my brother, we’re the guys that stop the monsters. We’re the guys that scare them. But you gotta talk to me.
It’s night time and we see Baby pulling into a parking garage for the Royal Towers Hotel.
Sam: [As the boys exit the car] So he didn’t say anything?
Dean: Not a word. Whatever that kid saw, it messed him up.
Sam: Well I say we talk to the other friend, uh, Mike, first thing in the morning.
Dean: Sounds like a plan.
Sam: So, strip club?
Dean: Wait. Sorry. What?
Sam: [Stammering] Mm, s-strip…club. There’s one just outside of town, the, uh… Clamdiver.
Dean: You wanna go to the Clamdiver?
Sam: Yeah. It – it got great reviews.
Dean: You read reviews for the Clamdiver?
Sam: [Still stammering] It – it – it got four and a half –
Dean: Dude, what is going on with you?
Sam: What are you talking about?
Dean: All day. You give me a-a beer for breakfast. You – you gave me Agent Page, which you always like to be. You – you didn’t whine about me blaring my music the whole way here. And when we stopped for lunch, you ordered my chili fries.
Sam: You love chili fries.
Dean: Everybody loves chili fries. That’s not the point. Now you wanna go hang out at a strip club? You hate strip clubs.
Sam: [Scoffing] No I don’t.
Dean: Dude the last lap dance you had – was – was at Christmas. It was a gift paid for by me. You spent the entire song trying to convince the girl that she should go to nursing school. So what is it? Is it my birthday? Did – did I win a bet that I don’t know about? What?
Sam: No, nothing. Nothing. I – I mean, I’m just trying to be nice.
Dean: Why?
Sam: Because… [Deep sigh] You know why.
Dean: I’m fine.
Sam: No, you’re not, Dean. [Dean turns to enter the hotel, Sam follows] You said you don’t believe in anything and – and that’s… that’s not true. That’s not you. You – you – you do believe in things. You believe in people. That’s who you are. That’s what you do. I know you’re in a dark place, and I-I just want to help.
Dean: Okay. Look, I-I’ve been down this road before and I fought my way back. I will fight my way back again.
Sam: How?
Dean: Same way I always do – bullets, bacon, and booze. [Rings front desk bell] A lotta booze.
We see Shawn wake screaming in his bedroom. Mrs. Raider enters worried.
Penny: Shawn! [Trying to comfort her son] It’s okay. It’s okay, baby. Just a bad dream. [Laying him back down] Try to get some sleep, all right?
Shawn: Okay.
Penny: [Smiling tearfully] That’s good. That’s good.
Penny kisses Shawn’s forehead, tucks him in, turns out the light and leaves the room, leaving the door open slightly. Shawn then hears the whirring sound of the drill. Looking around his room he sees nothing until a figure of the masked man with the drill appears by the window. The last image is of the figure charging towards Shawn.
Act 2
In the hotel room the alarm clock is beeping and Sam reaches to shut it off. He notices that Dean’s bed has not been slept in. He hears loud snoring and as he moves to the foot of his bed he sees Dean in his Fed threads laying on the floor with a pink bra around his neck, something else tied around his head and what appears to be a whip in his hand on his chest.
Sam: Great. [Dean continues to snore loudly]
Sam gets dressed in his Fed threads, checks on Dean who is still snoring loudly, grabs the keys to Baby and leaves the hotel room. Sam is now at a farm talking to Mike Ramos who is unloading bales of hay.
Sam: So, you don’t know where Shawn went that night?
Mike: No. I already told the cops.
Sam: Right. Of course. But problem is, when something bad happens, we have to triple-check.
Mike: Anyway, I wasn’t with them.
Sam: “Them.” You weren’t with them. So Shawn was with somebody. Maybe your friend Evan?
Mike: I don’t know.
Sam: You know, I’d like to believe you, Mike, but, um… here’s the thing. You ever see those detective shows where whenever somebody lies, they dart their eyes to the side?
Mike: That’s a real thing?
Sam: Oh, yeah. So if there’s anything that you forgot to tell the police, I need you to tell me. [Mike is looking around nervously] Mike. Evan could be in serious danger.
Mike: [Scoffs] He’s not. He’s just hiding out somewhere. Evan is always pulling crap like this. It’s just a prank.
Sam: Okay, so what happened to Shawn, that’s a prank, too?
Mike: They, um, they were going to the old Meadows place, out on Nighthawk Drive.
Sam: Okay. How come?
Mike: Evan dared us to go, and… it was stupid and creepy, and I didn’t… I-I got scared. But Evan, Shawn… they’re gonna be okay, right?
Dean is at the breakfast buffet at the hotel with sunglasses on, loading his plate with strips of bacon. Sam enters.
Sam: Hangover raid on the continental breakfast?
Dean: Shh.
Sam: What?
Dean: First of all, it’s complimentary. Second of all, what happened to being nice to me? [Sam pulls a bottle of liquor out of a paper bag and hands it to Dean] You are forgiven.
Sam: So I talked to the other friend – uh, Mike. And I think I got something. [Showing Dean his Ipad with the case information] Meet Dr. Avery Meadows. He worked here back in the early 60’s. Uh, people would come to him for help with mental illness. But no matter what they had – depression, anxiety, whatever – the cure was always the same. He lobotomized them.
Dean: Mm. Fun.
Sam: Yeah. Those that lived, he kept at his “patients.” [Sam uses quotey fingers] And he would experiment on them in his house, which is exactly where Evan and Shawn were headed that night.
Dean: That’s where Shawn for freaked out and where Eva went missing?
Sam: Worth a shot. I mean, when people found out what Meadows was doing, he was tried and executed. But who knows? You know, maybe he made a demon deal.
Dean: Or maybe he wasn’t even human to begin with. [Sam nods in agreement, looking at the iPad] This here? That’s what Shawn was drawing over and over.
Sam: Really?
Dean: Yeah. What’s up with the creepy-ass mask?
Sam: It’s a plague mask. Doctors used to use them. They thought they filtered out disease. As a matter of fact, when they arrested Meadows, he was wearing one. They had to hold him down to rip it off.
Sam’s cell phone rings and he stops the conversation to answer it.
Sam: Hello? Penny. What happened?
We next see Penny in Shawn’s bedroom talking with the boys.
Penny: I don’t know. Shawn had a bad dream. I checked on him. I… It seemed like he was getting better. I went back to my room, but it got a little cold, [Sam shoots a knowing look at Dean] so I thought Shawn must have opened a window. But when I came back in to close it, he was just… gone.
Dean looks at the drawings on Shawn’s desk and picks one up. The boys are now exiting the Raider house.
Dean: This is on me, man. I saw how messed up Shawn was. I should’ve pushed him harder.
Sam: We don’t know he’s dead, all right. Penny said it got cold, so it could be a ghost.
Dean: Yeah, but what’s a ghost doing, showing up at a kid’s place? It’s not like Shawn was dragging a body around.
Sam: According to the reports, Meadows was cremated. So maybe his spirit is tied to something else, an object…
Dean: So, what, Shawn took something from the house?
Sam: It’s possible.
Dean: All right, where’s the kid now?
Sam: Well, Meadows “treated” [quotey fingers again] the victims at his house. So if this is him, maybe that’s where he took Shawn.
The boys get into Baby in unison and we see Baby’s tires as she speeds off.
It is night time when we see Baby pull up in front of the Meadows Mental Health Center. The boys are in their hunting gear as they enter the house, calling for Shawn.
Dean: Shawn? Shawn, you in here? [Sam drops the duffle bag in the background]
Sam: [Switching on the EMF meter it starts warbling] Oh, dude. Check this out. Definitely a ghost.
Dean: [Calmly] Sam.
Sam turns out of the way and we see the man in the bird-mask holding the whirring drill.
Dean: What’s up, Doc?
The masked man hits Sam, sending him flying across the room into several chairs. The figure rapidly moves in front of Dean and before he has a chance to react, the figure knocks the sawed-off salt gun out of Dean’s hands and send Dean across the room in another direction, hitting a chain link fence. We see the masked figure in front of Dean, coming closer to his head with the whirring drill. The scene ends with a close-up end-shot of the drill.
Act 3
We see the whirring drill. Sam swings a crow bar at the figure and it disappears. Sam helps Dean up.
Dean: Thanks.
Sam: Yeah.
Sam and Dean ascend the large staircase and travel down the long corridor just as the young boys did.
Sam: Shawn?
Sam and Dean find the same examination room and Dean spots the masks on the shelf.
Dean: The mask. You said that they practically had to tear it off of him, right?
Sam: Yeah.
Dean: So, if he’s tied to something… [Dean picks up a mask and we hear Meadows screaming and the whirring drill from somewhere] I’ll take that as a “yes.”
Sam: Door. Salt. Burn ‘em.
Dean: All of them?
Sam: Yeah!
Dean finds a trash can and starts to burn the masks as Sam salts the door. The masked figure appears through the door but is stopped part-way through by the salt line so retreats. We hear loud rumbling and the salt line is blown away.
Sam: No. We ain’t got much time. [The masked man appears again and Sam blasts him with the salt gun but he quickly reappears.] Hurry!
Dean lights the masks on fire and we see the figure disappearing in flames as well.
Dean: You good?
Sam: Yeah, I’m good. Let’s go find Shawn.
Dean: Yeah.
The boys gather their stuff and head down the long corridor when Sam suddenly slows.
Sam: Dean? Wait. I can still see your breath.
Dean: What the hell, dude? [Door slams in the distance]
Sam: I think it might be another ghost. [Glass shatters]
Dean: I think there is a lot. [Lightbulbs shattering] Let’s go! Go!
We hear “We need a doctor!” in repeated whispers.
Dean: They are asking for the doctor.
Sam: These must be the people he killed.
Dean: Well if they’re ghosts, then why can’t we see them?
Sam: Maybe they aren’t strong enough to pierce the Veil. [More lights shatter and the beds move towards them]
Dean: Yeah, but they’re strong enough to kill us?! Great. [They boys descend the large staircase] You know what? Those bodies have gotta be buried in the house somewhere.
Sam: Okay, so we check it, top to bottom.
Dean: There’s no time. [Rummaging through duffle bag]
Sam: What are you doing?
Dean: I’m gonna find out where these bodies are buried.
Sam: So?
Dean: So I’m gonna ask ‘em.
Sam: What? How?
Dean: Easy. [Opens metal box and holds up two large syringes] One needle stops the heart, the other one starts it up again.
Sam: No, no, no.
Dean: Look, we can’t talk to ‘em on this side of the Veil, so I’m gonna go to the other side. I’m gonna work my way through all these Caspers until we find out there this freak hid the bodies.
Sam: Dean, you’re talking about killing yourself.
Dean: [Preparing the syringe] Yeah? Well, it worked before.
Sam: That’s an insane risk to take.
Dean: Listen, I need three minutes. Okay?
Sam: Don’t even….Dean! [Dean plunges needle into his chest] Dean? Hey. Damn it. Hey, hey, hey– [Sam tries to help Dean but he gasps and dies] Dean? Dean!
We see ghost Dean standing behind the scene of Sam kneeling over Dean’s body. Ghost Dean moves to the large staircase.
Dean: Hey! Ghost dude! Hey, hey, hey. Hey wait up, pal.
Dean is following a pale ghost with bloody eyes but is stopped by a polite young woman with red hair.
Jessica: Hello, my name is Jessica and I’m here to lead you to your next life.
Dean: Yeah, hi. Dean. Little busy right now. Yo! [Calling to the pale ghost]
Jessica: Oh, God.
Sam is checking his watch as he kneels next to Dean. He grabs a container of salt from the duffle and pours a circle around Dean. We then see Jessica walking quickly down an extensive corridor of black and white shelves stacked with black books. The shelves are all labeled with a “W.”
Jessica: Dean Winchester is in the Veil.
Sam is preparing the second syringe for Dean. Checking his watch again.
Sam: Come on, Dean. Come on.
Dean is following the pale ghost with bloody eyes.
Dean: Hey. Wait up. Hey. Hey, do you, uh…. [The pale ghost vanishes through a large fireplace] Oh, come on.
Shawn: I know you. [Dean turn so see Shawn’s ghost]
Dean: Shawn.
Shawn: You’re the FBI man from my house. You’re dead, too?
Dean: I, uh… Yeah. What happened to you?
Shawn: The man with the drill. He was in my room.
We see an image of the masked figure in Shawn’s bedroom as Shawn get out of bed. The masked figure charges at Shawn and disappears into Shawn’s body. A trickle of ectoplasm can then be seen coming from his eye. Shawn takes out the mask that Evan put in his backpack and puts it on. Shawn walks to the Meadow’s Center while wearing the mask, enters the examination room, removes the mask and places it back on the shelf.
Dean: The Doc – he possessed you and he killed you.
Shawn is staring blankly as he brings the whirring drill to his temple. Blood splatters on a dingy cabinet.
Shawn: I couldn’t stop it. He said I’d feel better, but… I just… I miss my mom.
Dean: Shawn, I should’ve… I’m so sorry.
Shawn: Evan’s here, too. We can’t leave. We… Why can’t we leave?
Sam is checking his watch as thunder claps outside.
Sam: Stupid.
Dean: I know you’re scared, okay? But I’m gonna help you. I’m gonna help you get out of here.
Shawn: Help me get home?
Dean: Help you go to a better place. But I need you to tell me… The doc, where did he put your body?
Dean is running up the large staircase to where Sam is with Dean’s body.
Dean: Sam? Sam, I got it! Let’s do this.
Sam: [Timer on his watch beeps] All right. [Injects second needle into Dean’s chest]
Dean: Come on, come on, come on.
Sam: Dean. Dean? Hey! Dean! [Patting and shaking Dean with no response]
Dean: Why is it not working?
Sam: No, no. No, no, no, no. Dean! Hey. Can you hear me? Dean. Dean! Hey, wake up. [Continuing to pat and shake Dean] Hey, Dean. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
A familiar voice: [From somewhere behind Dean] Hey, Dean.
Sam: Hey! Wake up.
Dean: [Turning] Billie.
Billie: We need to talk. [fade out]

Act 4
Sam: Hey. Hey! Wake up, Dean.
Billie: And…
Sam: Wake up. Hey! [Scene of Sam and Dean’s body freezes]
Billie: That’s enough of that.
Dean: No, I saw Cas kill you.
Billie: How’s that working out for him? It’s funny to hear a Winchester talk about the finality of dying. This reality – it has rules, Dean. So many rules. And one of them? Kill one incarnation of Death, like you did, the next Reaper to dies takes his place. So… when Castiel stabbed me in the back, turns out, I got a promotion. [We see Billie’s hand with a white stoned ring, very similar to the ring Death wore] New job. New gear.
Dean: So you died to become Death?
Billie: This universe can be so many things, and sometimes, it is poetic. That’s why we need to talk.
Dean is suddenly standing in the black and white corridor of shelves with Billie.
Dean: The hell?
Billie: Welcome to my reading room. Know not to leave this lying around near you. Don’t we? [Billie leans her scythe against the wall]
Dean: So… am I dead?
Billie: You killed yourself.
Dean: No. Are you keeping me dead?
Billie: Now that depends on you.
Dean: Okay. Uh… Well, congrats on the promotion. Uh, but I got a house full of ghosts waiting on me and my brother to get back to, so if it’s up to me –
Billie: I didn’t say it was up to you. I said it depends on you. Word on the interdimensional street is you’ve been slipping between worlds, Dean. I wanna know how you did it. Now.
Dean: Well, I thought Death knew everything.
Billie: Then you can imagine how this one little blind spot is really bothering me.
Dean: What’s in it for me?
Billie: What do you want?
Dean: Free the ghosts.
Billie: Excuse me?
Dean: Free the ghosts at the Meadow’s house. Let them move on, I’ll tell you whatever you wanna know.
Billie: Deal.
At the bottom of the large staircase we see the Reaper Jessica speaking to the ghosts at the house.
Jessica: Come with me. You don’t have to stay here. It’s going to be okay.
One by one the ghosts start disappearing in a cloud of dust. We see Evan’s and Shawn’s ghosts disappear as Jessica smiles warmly.
Billie: It’s done.
Dean: How do I know I can trust you?
Billie: You don’t. But then again, I’m not the one breaking cosmic bargains left and right, now, am I?
Dean: Yeah, it’s not like you to hold a grudge.
Billie: Don’t I? So… spill.
Dean: Lucifer’s son. Jack. When he was born, it created a little rip.
Billie: “A little rip”?
Dean: Mm.
Billie: Into another world? And you went there?
Dean: Mm. Yeah, I’ll just say it’s, uh, it’s not Candy Land.
Billie: I’ll bet.
Dean: Why do you care?
Billie: Because I do. Because…this whole multi-versal quantum construct we live in, it’s like a house of cards. And the last thing I need is some big, dumb Winchester knocking it all down.
Dean: Hmm. That does sound like us.
Billie: You’ve changed. When you bargained with me just now, you could’ve asked to go back, to live.
Dean: Well, I figured with you in charge, there’s no getting back for me.
Billie: That doesn’t sound like the Dean Winchester I know and love. The man who has been dead so many times but it never seems to stick. Maybe you’re not that guy anymore, they guy who saves the world, the guy who always thinks he’ll win no matter what. You have changed. And you tell people it’s not a big deal. You tell people you’ll work through it but you know you won’t, you can’t and that scares the hell out of you. Or… am I wrong?
Dean: What do you want me to say? Doesn’t matter. I don’t matter.
Billie: Don’t you?
Dean: I couldn’t save Mom. I couldn’t save Cas. I can’t even save a scared little kid. Sam keeps trying to fix it, but I just keep dragging him down. So I’m not going to beg. Okay, if it’s my time, it’s my time.
Billie: You really believe that. [Dean shakes his head yes] You wanna die. Dean…every notebook on this particular shelf tells a version of how you die. You specifically, heart attack, burned by a red-haired witch, stabbed by a ghoul in a graveyard, and on and on. But which one’s right? That depends on you, on the choices you make.
Dean: Well, I guess I made my choice.
Billie: But…unfortunately none of these books say you die today.
Dean: Come again?
Billie: Since I got this…new job, I stand witness to a much larger picture. Do you know what I see? You. And your brother. You’re important.
Dean: Why?
Billie: You have work to do. That’s all you need to know. And trust me, having my eyes opened to the necessity of any humans, especially Winchesters, is not a thrill. So…you wanna die, but I say…keep living.
Dean: Hmm. I need to know. My mom–
Dean’s body suddenly comes to life with a huge gasp for air.
Sam: Hey. You’re okay.
Dean: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah. You’re okay. [Slumps wearily against the wall]

Act 5
The coroner’s team is removing an occupied body bag from the Meadow’s house. Sam squeezes Mrs. Raider’s arm as to comfort her but says nothing. He walks to Dean by the Impala, past police gathering evidence from two partial skeletons laid out on a tarp.
Dean: How’d it go?
Sam: About how’d you figure. Hey, what happened back there? I mean, the shot didn’t work and all of a sudden, you’re back.
Dean: I don’t know. I guess it took a minute for the drug to kick in. I guess I got lucky.
Sam: Lucky?
Dean: Yeah.
Sam: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold – Dean. Hold on a second. What about the ghosts? ‘Cause I checked the EMF. They’re all gone. Was that lucky too?
Dean: We can talk about it later.
Sam: We won’t talk about it later. You know that.
Dean: [Watching Penny talk with the police] I saw Death. The death.
Sam: He’s dead.
Dean: No, she’s not.
Dean: It’s Billie. I guess she got a new gig. She’s the one that took care of the ghosts.
Sam: [Stammering] W-why would she help us?
Dean: She wanted intel. She said that we’re important, that we have work to do.
Sam: What the hell’s that mean?
Dean: I have no friggin’ clue. [Dean returns to watching a very distraught Penny speak with a police officer]
Sam: You okay?
Dean: No. Sam, I’m not okay. I’m pretty far from okay. You know, my whole life, I always believed that what we do was important. No matter what the cost, no matter who we lost, whether it was Dad or – or Bobby or –. And I would take the hit. But I kept on fighting because I believed that we were making the world a better place. And now Mom and Cas… And I – I don’t know. I don’t know.
Sam: So now you don’t believe anymore.
Dean: I just need a win. I just need a damn win.
Dean and Sam get into Baby, start the engine up and exit the crime scene. We see Baby cruising along a highway under a bright, clear sky. Cut to the Coroner’s team bringing out another occupied body bag. They stop and unzip the bag so Penny can identify the contents. It is Shawn.
Nighttime shot of Baby traveling on a backroad highway.
Billie takes one of the black books off the shelf and starts reading the hand-written pages.
Back in Baby a cell phone rings, waking Sam. Dean answers.
Dean: Yeah. [Dean looks dumbfoundedly at Sam]
Sam: What?
Baby is driving down a narrow back street. Dean stops and shuts off the car. A figure can barely be seen in the shadows. They boys exit the car. As they approach the figure standing next to a payphone, he turns to reveal it is Cas.
