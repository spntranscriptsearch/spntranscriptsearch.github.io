INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA – DAY

It’s lunch time, and the “popular” table is full of cheerleaders and jocks.

GIRL 1
She's such a slut.

BOY 1
So? Personally, I'm very pro-slut. What happened, anyway?

GIRL 1
She totally banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what. She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.

TAYLOR walks up to the table, looking for a place to sit down.

GIRL 1
Hi, Taylor. How was your weekend?

TAYLOR
Fine, I guess.

GIRL 1
You didn't... go to the rodeo?

TAYLOR
(to someone sitting at the table) That's my spot.

GIRL 1
Sorry. This is a skeev-free zone.

BOY 1
Slut!

TABLE
Slut! Slut! Slut! Slut!

TAYLOR storms off, slams down her tray and sits down at another table. The only other person at the table is APRIL, an overweight shy girl.

APRIL
You shouldn't listen to those jerks.

TAYLOR
Leave me alone.

APRIL
I just mean... I'm sorry, that's all.

TAYLOR
You? You're sorry? Don't you feel sorry for me, you fat, ugly pig.

APRIL is upset, and leaves the table in a hurry.

INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM – DAY

TAYLOR is upset, looking at herself in the mirror. She has been crying. She doesn’t see APRIL approach her from one of the stalls.

APRIL
Do you think I'm ugly?

TAYLOR
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean it, okay?

APRIL grabs TAYLOR and slams her around, hitting her head hard on the mirror and sink, then dragging her to one of the stalls. TAYLOR screams.

TAYLOR
Aah! Aah!

APRIL
I'm not ugly.

APRIL holds TAYLOR’S head under water in the toilet until TAYLOR stops struggling. She lets TAYLOR fall to the ground, looks down at the unmoving TAYLOR, and black goo (ectoplasm) comes out of one of her eyes.

APRIL
You're ugly.

SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)

EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY

We see an outside shot of the hospital.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY

SAM is in hospital whites, dressed as an orderly. He is sitting in a chair with a clipboard talking to APRIL.

APRIL
I'm not talking about it anymore. I already told the cops and the doctors. No one believes me. They think I'm crazy.

SAM
Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most. April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?

APRIL
It doesn't matter.

SAM
It matters to me.

APRIL
When I -- when I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head, but I couldn't control my body. I could see what I was doing, but I couldn't stop. I just wanted to stop. I'm sorry.

SAM
You don’t need to apologize. April, some of the kids at school told the police that you and Taylor didn't get along.

APRIL
Well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her. Never. Do you believe me?

SAM
Yeah, I do. Just a couple more questions. On the day this happened, did you... happen to smell anything?

APRIL
Anything... like what?

SAM
Like rotten eggs or... sulfur?

APRIL
Um, no.

SAM
Okay. Um, did you notice any black smoke?

APRIL
What are you, crazy?

INT. IMPALA – DAY

SAM approaches the IMPALA, where DEAN is waiting for him, and climbs in the passenger door.

DEAN
So?

SAM
I think she's telling the truth. I mean, the way she talked about being there mentally but not physically -- kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.

DEAN
Kind of?

SAM
She didn't see any black smoke or smell sulfur.

DEAN
Maybe it's not a demon. I mean, kids can be vicious.

SAM
Well, I mean, we're already here. Might as well check out the school.

DEAN
Right. The school.

SAM
What?

DEAN
Truman High, home of the Bombers.

SAM
What's your point?

DEAN
I mean, we went there, like... for a month a million years ago. Why are you so jazzed to go back?

SAM
I'm not. I just think it's worth looking into.

DEAN
All right, well, what's our cover? FBI? Homeland Security? Swedish exchange students?

SAM
Don't worry. I got an idea.

DEAN
Okay.

They drive off.

FLASHBACK – EXT. SCHOOL – DAY

“Long, Long Way from Home” (Foreigner) plays while the IMPALA drives up to the front of the school. YOUNG SAM and YOUNG DEAN get out of the car. The driver isn’t shown, but it’s hinted that it’s a younger John.

TITLE CARD: TRUMAN HIGH SCHOOL 1997

YOUNG DEAN (looks in car window)
Thanks, Dad.

YOUNG DEAN and YOUNG SAM start walking towards the school.

YOUNG DEAN (to YOUNG SAM)
Got your lunch? Books? Butterfly knife?

YOUNG SAM
Yeah, Dean.

YOUNG DEAN
You okay?

YOUNG SAM
Sure.

YOUNG DEAN
Sammy...

YOUNG SAM
I mean, look, this is the third school we've been to this year, and it's only November. I'm just sick of always being the new kid.

YOUNG DEAN
You'll be fine. If anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know. Relax. Dad said this hunt will take him two weeks, tops. As soon as he gets back, we're out of here.

YOUNG SAM
To another school. Awesome.

FLASHBACK – INT. SCHOOL CLASS ROOMS – DAY

The scene changes back and forth from YOUNG SAM’s and YOUNG DEAN’s classrooms as they are introduced. First up is YOUNG SAM, as he stands in front of a classroom while being introduced by the teacher, MR. WYATT.

MR. WYATT
Ladies and gentlemen, please say hello to Sam Winchester.

CLASS
Hi, Sam. Hi, Sam. Hi, Sam. Hi, Sam.

FLASHBACK – INT. YOUNG DEAN’S CLASS ROOM – DAY

YOUNG DEAN stands in front of his class, while his teacher, an older woman, talks to the class.

DEAN’S TEACHER
Class, say hello to our new student, Dean Winchester. Dean, is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?

YOUNG DEAN
Not really, sweetheart.

DEAN’S TEACHER
Take your seat.

FLASHBACK – INT. YOUNG SAM’S CLASS ROOM – DAY

YOUNG SAM stands in the front of the class, obviously uncomfortable.

MR. WYATT
Is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?

YOUNG SAM
Not really.

MR. WYATT
Okay. Uh, grab a seat.

FLASHBACK – INT. YOUNG DEAN’S CLASS ROOM – DAY

YOUNG DEAN walks down the aisle, and takes an empty seat.

FLASHBACK – INT. YOUNG SAM’S CLASS ROOM – DAY

YOUNG SAM walks down the aisle to an empty desk. He places his backpack on the desk; his knife falls out on the seat. He quickly grabs it and hides it, but not before BARRY, who is sitting next to YOUNG SAM, sees it.

BARRY
Whoa, that's yours? Awesome!

FLASHBACK – INT. YOUNG DEAN’S CLASS ROOM – DAY

DEAN’S TEACHER
Dean, where are your books?

YOUNG DEAN
Don't need 'em, sugar. Not gonna be here long enough anyway.

DEAN notices AMANDA, and they share a look.

FLASHBACK – INT. YOUNG SAM’S CLASS ROOM – DAY

MR. WYATT
All right, gang... essay assignment.

CLASS
Aw! Aw! Aw! Aw!

MR. WYATT
Yeah, yeah, my heart breaks for you.

BARRY (whispers to YOUNG SAM)
Hey... I'm Barry.

YOUNG SAM
Sam.

MR. WYATT
Okay, now, I want three pages of your most memorable family experience. Just a reminder though, this is going to be worth half your final grade… (he keeps talking in the background)

DIRK starts flicking BARRY’S ear while MR. WYATT is talking.

YOUNG SAM (to DIRK)
Leave him alone.

DIRK
Shh, I'm going for a record.

MR. WYATT
I don’t care what you write about, or even how you write about it. I’m looking for the brutal, funny, maybe even painful, truth. OK everybody, any questions? OK, let’s get started.

YOUNG SAM
I said, leave him alone.

DIRK
You want to take his place... midget?

YOUNG SAM
Yeah. Sure.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY

SAM walks down a school hallway just as the bell rings dismissing class. He is dressed as a janitor and is pushing a janitor’s cart. He passes MR. WYATT’S room, where class is getting out. It is the same MR. WYATT we saw before, but older.

INT. SCHOOL GYM – DAY

DEAN is dressed in a white shirt and tight red shorts. He has a red headband on his head. He blows a whistle, then addresses the class.

DEAN
Today, you will have the honor of playing one of the greatest games ever invented. A game of skill, agility, cunning. A game with one simple rule... dodge.

DEAN throws the ball into CLASS MATE 1’s stomach. He doesn’t dodge.

CLASS MATE 1
Ugh!

DEAN
Sorry.

COLBY
Uh, Substitute Coach Roth...

DEAN
Yes?

COLBY
Ms. Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.

DEAN
Well, Ms. B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing.

COLBY
She says it's dangerous.

DEAN (blows whistle)
Take a lap!

COLBY
But --

SAM enters the gym, and gets DEAN’S attention. DEAN throws the bag of balls to the class.

DEAN
Go nuts.

SAM
Having fun?

DEAN
The whistle makes me their god.

SAM
Right. Nice shorts.

DEAN
Find anything?

SAM
I've been over the entire school twice. No sulfur.

DEAN
No sulfur, no demon. No demon, no case.

SAM
I don't know. Maybe I was wrong.

DEAN
Well, it happens to the best of us. I say we hit the road, huh? But after lunch -- it’s sloppy-joe day.

COLBY
Ohh! (he runs by SAM and DEAN holding his nose)

DEAN
Good hustle, Colby! Walk it off!

INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM – DAY

The scene opens to a Cuisinart spinning. It pans back to two students talking.

BOY 1
Hey, I need to copy your algebra homework again. (hits BOY 2 to get his attention) Hey!

BOY 2
Why? Cause you're a stupid, brain-dead dick?

BOY 1
I'm gonna shove my fist down your throat, you little freak.

BOY 2
That fist?

BOY 1
Yeah.

BOY 2 looks at BOY 1 and grins (not a happy grin, but a devilish grin) and grabs BOY 1’s hand and pushes it in the spinning Cuisinart. Blood goes everywhere, and BOY 1 starts screaming. A classmate helps BOY 1 out, and everyone else runs out. BOY 2 looks woozy, then falls down. SAM arrives just as he is going down. He runs over to BOY 2 and sees black goo (ectoplasm) oozing from BOY 2’s ear.

BOY 2
What happened?

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY

SAM and DEAN walk down a deserted school hallway.

SAM
How's the nonviolence assembly going?

DEAN
Apparently, shoving a kid's arm into a Cuisinart is not a "healthy display of anger." So, the kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear?

SAM
Which only comes from a seriously pissed-off spirit. It's got to be ghost possession.

DEAN
Yeah, but that's pretty rare.

SAM
Yeah, but it happens. I mean, they get angry enough, they can take control of a person's body.

DEAN
All right, so, what, we got a ghost in the building?

SAM
Yeah, but where? I mean, there's no EMF. Maybe we could find out who it is, at least. You know, check and see if somebody died bloody around here or something.

DEAN
Way ahead of you. I had to break into the principal's office to get this. Oh, and FYI, three of the cheerleaders are legal. Guess which ones.

SAM
No.

DEAN
(unfolds paper he took from his pocket) So, there was only one death on campus. It was a suicide back in '98. Some kid named Barry Cook. What?

SAM (sighs)
I knew him. How did he die?

DEAN
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.

SAM
That's where --

DEAN
Right where the chick got swirleyed to death, exactly. So, what? This ghost is possessing nerds?

SAM
And using them to go after bullies, yeah.

DEAN:
Well, does that sound like Barry’s M.O.?

SAM
Barry had a hard time.

FLASHBACK – INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY

It’s between classes and there are students in the hallway. BARRY is walking down the hall, and another student bumps him and makes him drop his books. YOUNG SAM sees this and helps him pick up his stuff.

BARRY
Thanks, Sam.

YOUNG SAM
Great school.

BARRY
I don't care. Three years, and I'm out of here. I'm going to Michigan State. They got the best vet program in the country.

YOUNG SAM
Do you like animals?

BARRY
They're a lot nicer than people.

FLASHBACK – INT. JANITORS CLOSET – DAY

YOUNG DEAN and AMANDA are making out.

YOUNG DEAN
So tonight I'm thinking you, me, a bucket of popcorn, extra butter...

AMANDA
Mm, kinky.

YOUNG DEAN
..and the midnight screening of "I Spit on Your Grave" at the Cinedome.

AMANDA
I can't. I have a curfew... at 11:00.

YOUNG DEAN
So?

AMANDA
So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month.

YOUNG DEAN
Yeah, parents. Terrifying.

AMANDA
Mm-hmm. Well, when's your curfew?

YOUNG DEAN
I don't have one.

AMANDA
Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?

YOUNG DEAN
My Dad's out of town on a job. It's just me and my brother.

AMANDA
For how long?

YOUNG DEAN
Couple of weeks.

AMANDA
Seriously?

YOUNG DEAN
Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at The Pines.

AMANDA
The motel?

YOUNG DEAN
Mm-hmm. HBO, magic fingers, free ice -- it's great.

AMANDA
Yeah... I guess.

YOUNG DEAN
What? I do whatever I want, whenever I want. It's perfect.

AMANDA
Yeah, but... don't you miss your Dad?

FLASHBACK – INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY

YOUNG DEAN and AMANDA emerge from the closet, just as YOUNG SAM and BARRY walk by.

YOUNG DEAN
Yo! Sammy!

YOUNG DEAN and AMANDA walk off.

BARRY
That's your brother with Amanda Heckerling? He's cool.

YOUNG SAM
Yeah. He thinks so.

DIRK
Hey, tough guy. I been looking for you. Still want to take Barry’s place?

YOUNG SAM
Get out of here, Barry.

BARRY
I'll go get a teacher.

DIRK
You want to go?

YOUNG SAM
I'm not gonna fight you, Dirk.

DIRK
Why not? You chicken? Come on!

YOUNG SAM
No.

DIRK hits YOUNG SAM, who falls to the ground. He stays there, looking up at DIRK.

DIRK
Get up! Get up! Come on! Get up!

MR. WYATT
Hey, get back! Get back. That is enough.

MR. WYATT takes off after DIRK, who has turned and walked away. YOUNG SAM watches them walk off.

EXT. GRAVEYARD – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are standing at BARRY’S grave, where they have already dug up his coffin. SAM puts in the salt and fuel, DEAN throws in the lighted match.

DEAN
So long, Barry Cook.

INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

The IMPALA drives down a dark road, and SAM and DEAN ride inside.

DEAN
You all right?

SAM
Barry was my friend. I just burned his bones.

DEAN
Well, he's at peace now, Sam.

SAM
I mean, if Dad had let us stay just a little while longer, maybe I could have helped the kid, you know?

DEAN
You read the coroner's report same as me. Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man. School was hell for that kid. His parents had split up. He just wanted out. It was tragic, but it's not your fault. To tell you the truth, I'm glad we got out of that town. I hated that school.

SAM
It wasn't all bad.

DEAN
How can you say that after what happened to you?

SAM looks over at DEAN, remembering that day.

FLASHBACK – EXT. SCHOOL YARD – DAY

YOUNG SAM and YOUNG DEAN are sitting on a small bleacher by the school.

YOUNG DEAN
That kid's dead.

YOUNG SAM
Dean.

YOUNG DEAN
I'm gonna rip his lungs out!

YOUNG SAM
It's not a big deal.

YOUNG DEAN
Not a big deal? Sammy, look at yourself. If Dad was here --

YOUNG SAM
He's not.

YOUNG DEAN
Well, I am! And as soon I'm finished with that dick --

YOUNG SAM
Shut up, okay?! I don't need your help.

YOUNG DEAN
That's right, you don't. You could have torn him apart. So why didn't you?

YOUNG SAM
Because I don't want to be the freak for once, Dean. I want to be normal.

YOUNG DEAN
So taking a beating -- that's normal?

YOUNG SAM
Any word from Dad?

YOUNG DEAN
He called this morning, said he's going to be another week at least. We weren’t supposed to be here this long.

YOUNG SAM
At least you've got Amanda. She’s cool.

YOUNG DEAN
Dude, she wants me to meet her parents. I don't do parents.

FLASHBACK – INT. CLASS ROOM – DAY

MR. WYATT’S classroom, class is over and students are leaving.

MR. WYATT
Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?

SAM walks up to MR. WYATT’S desk. BARRY is walking behind him.

BARRY
Um... I'll wait for you outside.

YOUNG SAM
Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it.

MR. WYATT
Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam. You know this assignment was nonfiction, right?

YOUNG SAM
Yes, Mr. Wyatt.

MR. WYATT
So you and your family killed a werewolf last summer, huh? Why would you write something like this, Sam?

YOUNG SAM
It doesn't matter. As soon as my Dad gets back, we're leaving, so you can flunk me if you want to.

MR. WYATT
I'm not flunking you. I'm giving you an "A." Now, aside from the werewolf, is that really how you'd describe your family?

YOUNG SAM
Yeah.

MR. WYATT
Well, your brother is quite a character. And your father -- he seems, uh, driven. Anyway, it's good, Sam. It’s really good. Have you ever thought about pursuing writing?

YOUNG SAM
I can't. I have to go into the family business.

MR. WYATT
Family business?

YOUNG SAM
Yeah, my, aah -- my dad's a mechanic. So I have to be a mechanic, too.

MR. WYATT
Do you want to go in the family business, Sam?

YOUNG SAM
No one's ever asked me that before.

MR. WYATT
Well?

YOUNG SAM
More than anything, no.

MR. WYATT
Well... I don't want to overstep my bounds here, but... you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. Look, I mean, I know what it's like. I come from a family of surgeons, and that wasn't me. So, you know, I traded in the money and prestige of being a doctor for all the glamour you see around you. But the point is... there may be three or four big choices that shape someone's whole life, and you need to be the one that makes them, not anyone else. You seem like a great kid, Sam. Just live the life you want to live.

EXT. IMPALA – DAY

SAM and DEAN drive up to the school.

DEAN
We came back here so you could talk to a teacher?

SAM
He's a good guy.

DEAN
Well, whatever. Go have your Robin Williams "O captain! My captain!" moment. Just make it quick.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY

SAM is walking down a deserted hallway and he looks deep in thought – he runs his hand through his hair as he walks. The scene changes to a flashback of YOUNG SAM walking down the same hall, running his hand through his hair the same way. We change back to SAM, and he is approached by a YOUNG WOMAN.

YOUNG WOMAN
Excuse me, sir, can you tell me find room 305?

SAM
Sure. Um... head down the hall, take your first right, and it’s the third door on the left.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks, Sam.

She takes out a knife and stabs him in the stomach.

YOUNG WOMAN
You got tall, Winchester.

She kicks SAM in the face. He falls to the ground. He opens a small jar he grabs from his jacket pocket, and when YOUNG WOMAN approaches, he grabs her and forces the salt in her mouth. The GHOST looks like it is ripped from her body and flies out the door. She collapses, and SAM sits in the hall holding her, looking around.

EXT. WOODS – DAY

SAM and DEAN are sitting on the IMPALA, enjoying a beverage and talking.

DEAN
Trust me. This will help. That ghost is dead. I'm gonna rip its lungs out! Well, you know what I mean.

SAM
It knew my name, Dean. My real name. We burned Barry’s bones. What the hell?

DEAN
Well, maybe it wasn't Barry. Maybe we missed something. We just got to go back. (he is reviewing a file while talking) No way. How did we not see this before?

SAM
What?

DEAN
Check it out -- Look, Martha Dumptruck, Revenge of the Nerds, and Hello Kitty -- they rode the same bus.

SAM
Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted.

DEAN
Well, that would explain why there's no EMF at the school, but not the attacks. I mean, ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt. They can't just bail.

SAM
Unless this one can. Dean, there's lore about spirits possessing people and riding them for miles, then whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt. But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want.

DEAN
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?

SAM
It's possible.

DEAN
Ghosts getting creative -- well, that's super.

INT. SCHOOL BUS – DAY

SAM is in the back of the bus with an EMF meter. DEAN is up front, searching for some clue of the ghost.

SAM
Definitely ain't clean.

DEAN
Here, ghosty, ghosty, ghosty! Come out, come out, wherever you are!

SAM
Man, I don't get it. No one ever died on this bus, and it's not like there's a body hidden in here.

DEAN
Yeah, but a flap of skin, a hair, I mean, hell, a hangnail -- something's got to be tying the ghost to this place. We just got to find it.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN (looking through papers at the front of the bus)
Got a new driving permit. Issued two weeks ago.

SAM
Just before the first attack.

DEAN
Yeah. Name of the bus driver is Dirk McGregor Sr., 39 North Central Avenue.

SAM
McGregor?

DEAN
Yeah. Why?

SAM
I knew his son.

DEAN
Did you know everybody at this school?

FLASHBACK – EXT. SCHOOL – DAY

School is letting out. DIRK pushes BARRY down.

DIRK (to BARRY)
Got to watch where you're going, man.

YOUNG SAM
Leave him alone, Dirk.

DIRK
You never learn, do you, midget?

YOUNG SAM
Get to the bus, Barry.

BARRY runs off, and DIRK pushes down YOUNG SAM.

DIRK
What's the matter? You scared? Don't worry. I'll go easy on you this time. Come on, Lose-chester. Let’s see what you got. Come on, freak! Freak!

YOUNG SAM gets up and starts fighting with DIRK. YOUNG SAM is clearly the better fighter, connecting with hard punches, while DIRK swings at the air. SAM knocks DIRK down.

YOUNG SAM
You're not tough. You're just a jerk. "Dirk the jerk."

Kids in the crowd pick up the chant, saying “Dirk the jerk”, “That’s pretty good”, etc. Then the crowd start chanting “Dirk the jerk” while DIRK runs off.

INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY

SAM and DEAN are in MR. MCGREGOR’S living room.

MR. MCGREGOR
So, you were friends with Dirk?

SAM
Yes, sir, in high school.

MR. MCGREGOR
I don't recall Dirk having many friends at Truman. Here, sit. Sit down.

DEAN
When did, uh -- when did Dirk pass?

MR. MCGREGOR
He was 18.

SAM
What happened to him?

MR. MCGREGOR
Well, there was, first, drinking, then drugs, and then too many drugs. And then he just slipped through my fingers. It was my fault. I should have seen it coming, you know? Dirk, he, uh -- he had his troubles.

DEAN
What kind of troubles?

MR. MCGREGOR
School was never easy for Dirk. We didn't have much money, and, well, you know, kids -- they can be cruel. They picked on him.

SAM
They picked on him?

MR. MCGREGOR
They called him poor and dirty and stupid. They even had a nickname for him -- Dirk the jerk. And after what happened to his mother, he…

SAM
His mother?

MR. MCGREGOR
Yeah, Jane, my wife. She died when Dirk was 13. Cancer. I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her. And he was a great kid. He made sure Jane got her medicine. He helped her, cleaned up after her. But, you know, you -- you watch somebody die slow, waste away to nothing... it does things to a person. Horrible things.

SAM
I didn't know about his mother.

MR. MCGREGOR
He -- he wouldn't talk about her, not even to me. Lot of anger in that boy.

SAM
I'm sorry.

DEAN
Well, we'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. McGregor. Um, you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?

MR. MCGREGOR
Oh, he wasn't. I had him cremated.

DEAN
All of him?

MR. MCGREGOR
Well, I kept a lock of his hair.

DEAN
Oh, that's -- that's nice. Where do you keep that?

MR. MCGREGOR
On my bus, in my Bible.

INT. SCHOOL BUS – NIGHT

EDDIE is driving the team bus.

COACH
Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie.

EDDIE
My pleasure, Coach.

EDDIE smiles a grin like he is up to no good.

CUT TO: The bus is driving fast down the road.

COACH
Eddie, you want to ease up on the pedal, there?

EDDIE
I got it all under control.

The bus drives over a spike strip and the tires blow. The bus swerves and comes to a stop.

SOMEONE ON BUS
What the hell was that?

SOMEONE ELSE ON BUS
Everyone okay?

The driver opens the bus door and steps out of the bus. DIRK is in the driver. SAM walks up and cocks his shotgun.

SAM
Dirk!

DIRK (IN EDDIE)
Winchester. What are you gonna do, shoot me?

DEAN sneaks up behind DIRK and wraps a rope around his middle.

SAM
Don't need to. That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk. You're not going anywhere.

DEAN sticks his head in the bus and addresses the team.

DEAN
All right, everybody stay where you are. You'll be okay.

SOMEONE ON BUS
Aren't you the P.E. Teacher?

DEAN
Not really. I'm like "21 Jump Street." The bus driver sells pot. Yeah.

DEAN looks for the lock of hair on the bus.

DEAN
It's not here!

SAM
Where is it?

DIRK
No way you'll ever find it.

SAM (pushes the shotgun up to DIRK’S chest)
Where is it?!

DIRK
Sam Winchester. Still a bully. You, you jocks... you popular kids... you always thought you were better than everybody else. And to you, I was just Dirk the jerk, right? Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.

SAM
I'm not evil, Dirk. I'm not. And neither were you. Trust me. I've seen real evil. We were scared and miserable, and we took it out on each other -- us and everybody else. That's high school. But you suffer through that, and it gets better. I'm just sorry you didn't get a chance to see that... you or Barry.

DIRK
Nothing is gonna get better for me. Not ever.

DIRK breaks out of the rope. SAM fires salt at him, and GHOST DIRK flies back to the bus. GHOST DIRK enters a student on the bus. The student gets off the bus and attacks SAM from behind. He starts beating SAM up. DEAN fires a salt shot at him but misses.

SAM
Dean! Find the hair!

DEAN goes to EDDIE, who is still lying down on the ground, and starts looking in his pockets for the lock of hair.

DEAN
Hey, buddy, this isn't what it looks like.

DEAN finds the lock of hair, takes out his lighter, and sets it on fire. GHOST DIRK screams and flies out of the student. The student falls on SAM. The team must have been the football or wrestling team, because the student was big. SAM calls out from under the student.

SAM
Little help?

DEAN
He's giving you the full cowgirl.

FLASHBACK – INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET – DAY

YOUNG DEAN is kissing a young girl that is not AMANDA. There is a knock at the door.

YOUNG DEAN
Five more minutes, Jerry.

AMANDA opens the door and YOUNG DEAN pulls away from the girl he was kissing. They walk out of the closet into the hallway.

YOUNG DEAN
Amanda, hey! (to other young woman) Gettysburg address, 1863, right? (to AMANDA) History test next period. We're studying. Come on, baby. She means nothing to me. Don't be mad.

AMANDA
I'm not mad, Dean. I thought maybe... underneath your whole "I could give a crap," bad-boy thing, that there was something more going on. I mean, like the way you are with your brother. But I was wrong. And you spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool, but it's just an act. We both know that you're just a sad... lonely little kid. And I feel sorry for you, Dean.

YOUNG DEAN
You feel sorry for me, huh? Don't feel sorry for me. You don't know anything about me. I save lives. I'm a hero. A hero!

AMANDA walks off to her friends who are standing nearby. They all look at YOUNG DEAN like he is a jerk.

YOUNG DEAN
What? What?!

FLASHBACK – INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY

The hallway is full of students. We see YOUNG SAM walking down the hall, and as he passes, students say things like “good job buddy”, “Sam, great job with Dirk the jerk” and slap his hand. We see YOUNG DEAN observing this. He is still obviously upset. DEAN gets a call on his cell.

YOUNG DEAN
Dad? Finally.

EXT. SCHOOL – DAY

YOUNG DEAN and YOUNG SAM are waiting outside as the IMPALA drives up. As they get in the car, YOUNG SAM sees BARRY at an upstairs window. He waves to him, and BARRY waves back.

DEAN
I can't wait to get the hell out of here. This place sucks. Come on, Sam.

YOUNG DEAN gets in the car.

DEAN
Come on, Sam!

INT. CLASS ROOM – DAY

MR. WYATT is alone in his classroom at his desk, grading papers. SAM knocks on the door and enters.

SAM
Uh, Mr. Wyatt?

MR. WYATT
Yes.

SAM
You probably don't remember me, um, but my name is Sam Winchester, and I just wanted to thank you.

MR. WYATT
For?

SAM
I was a student here, and uh, you gave me some advice once.

MR. WYATT
Winchester, right. Right. Yeah. You, uh -- you wrote that horror story.

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, I did. Yeah, it's kind of all been one long horror story.

MR. WYATT
What do you mean?

SAM
Nothing. Sorry.

MR. WYATT
So, what was this advice? I might need to plagiarize myself down the line.

SAM
You told me that I didn't have to go into the family business. You said I should make my own choices.

MR. WYATT
So you've managed to do your own thing, then, huh?

SAM
Yeah, for a while, yeah. And I think I went to college because of you. But, you know, people grow up.

MR. WYATT
Yeah.

SAM
Responsibilities. But still, um... you took an interest in me when no one else did. That matters, so thank you.

MR. WYATT
Well, you know, the only thing that really matters is that you're happy. Are you happy, Sam?

SAM does not reply.
