Teaser
New Canaan, Connecticut [We see the exterior of a mansion then the interior hall with a portrait of a woman holding a dog. Phillip, the butler, walks up to two maids who are standing in the hallway.]

PHILLIP

Now, now. I know it’s a terribly sad day. Bunny LaCroix was a good woman, a fair employer with a kind heart. [The two maids look close to tears.] But there is work to be done. In less than twenty-four hours the LaCroix family will descend upon this estate for the funeral and the reading of the will and it is our duty to make sure this manor is in tip-top shape. [He looks at the portrait] We owe that much to Bunny.

[To the first maid] Colette. To the master closet. I’d like you to select Mrs. LaCroix’s wardrobe for the burial. [To the second maid] Olivia. Please make sure all the lavatories are spotless.

OLIVIA

Why do I have to?

PHILLIP

Now, now. You’re still the new hire. Colette has seniority. [he claps his hands twice] Chop chop, there’s no time to waste. [Colette hurries up the staircase and Olivia heads in the opposite direction. Phillip looks in the direction Olivia went and then walks away.]

[Interior of Bunny’s walk-in closet in the master bedroom. Colette selects a suit and then a blouse. She opens the jewelry box and chooses a brooch. She then takes a pearl necklace and puts it on. She hears a door open and looks around. She goes back to admiring the necklace on herself in the mirror but then hears a door close. She walks out of the closet into the bedroom toward the door and hears footsteps. She turns around and gasps. Bunny LaCroix is standing behind her.]

COLETTE

But….you’re dead. [Bunny is glaring at Colette and takes steps toward her. Colette keeps backing away until they are out in the hallway. Bunny rips the pearl neckace off Colette’s neck. The necklace breaks showering the pearls on the floor. Colette tries to back up and falls over the banister screaming. She falls through a glass table on the first floor. She lies dead on the floor surrounded by broken glass as Bunny stands by the banister on the second floor looking down.]

[Phillip runs up to where Colette is lying looking at Colette and then up at Bunny]

PHILLIP

What have you done? [Bunny just turns and walks away.]

SUPERNATURAL TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
[Shady Hills Motel parking lot - Dean is tightening a screw on the Impala’s headlight. Sam approaches carrying two tiny cups.]

SAM

Hey, yo. Individually brewed. [hands one cup to Dean.] Technology, man.

DEAN

Real men don’t drink out of cups this small. [He smells the coffee.] What is that cinnamon roll?

SAM

It’s uh glazed donut. Look man, if you don’t want it, I…

DEAN

Nah, it’s…got it. [takes a sip of the coffee] So, any leads on the scanner or the Interweb?

SAM

Nothing. Not even a cat up a tree.

DEAN

So right when we’re ready to jump back into it, it goes uh—radio silence.

SAM

Murphy’s law.

DEAN

Well, Murphy’s a douche. Hey, feel like taking a detour to Connecticut?

SAM

What?

DEAN

[Dean holds up a cell phone] Found it while I was dustbusting. [hands phone to Sam]

SAM

One of ours?

DEAN

It’s one of Bobby’s. And, in total, 27 messages. The only one that counts is from two days ago. Apparently Bobby’s been named a beneficiary in Bunny LaCroix’s will.

SAM

Bunny LaWho?

DEAN

Attorney said she’s an heiress and Bobby’s presence or next of kin is being requested in New Canaan. I figured we qualify. [Dean takes another sip of coffee]

SAM

How did Bobby know an heiress?

DEAN

Bobby had secrets, man. Like loving on Tori Spelling. If he only knew Dean cheated on her. Anyway, road trip? Who knows – maybe Bobby earned us some beer money.

[The Impala is speeding down a road. Then Sam and Dean park the Impala in front of Bunny LaCroix’s mansion among other very expensive cars.]

SAM

Wow. Think we’re a little underdressed? I mean the Fed threads are in the trunk.

DEAN

You kidding me? For once, we don’t have to wear suits. [They walk toward the front door] You’re lucky my waist band’s not elastic.

[Dean presses the doorbell. Beethoven’s Fuer Elise plays. Olivia opens the front door.]

OLIVIA

May I help you?

SAM

I’m Sam Winchester. This is Dean Winchester. We’re here on behalf of Bobby Singer.

OLIVIA

Mr. Singer won’t be coming?

DEAN

No, he passed away.

OLIVIA

Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.

SAM

Uh, condolences for your loss too.

OLIVIA

Thank you. Well, you just missed the funeral, but the family’s relaxing inside if you’d like to join.

[Olivia leads Sam and Dean into the billiard room where the LaCroix family are. She clears her throat.]

Allow me to introduce Sam and Dean Winchester.

HEDDY

Sam and Dean Winchester of the Westchester Winchesters?

SAM

Uh no. I don’t think there’s…

DEAN

Nah.

SAM

…any relation. Sorry

HEDDY

No matter. You two are adorable.

DEAN

Oh.

HEDDY

I’m Heddy, Bunny’s cousin and this is my sister, Beverly.

BEVERLY

Charmed I’m sure.

HEDDY

[indicates to man playing pool] And that’s Bunny’s youngest brother Stanton. Stan for short.

STANTON

Come on in fellas, join the mourning.

HEDDY

And his child bride…Amber.

AMBER

Go Stan!

STANTON

[misses shot] Babe, don’t. You’re breaking my concentration.

HEDDY

And then there’s Dash. That’s the baby of the family. He’s Bunny’s great nephew – Harvard business.

DASH

How did you guys know Aunt Bunny?

DEAN

We uh…

SAM

We – we – we didn’t personally know her. Our – our surrogate dad, Bobby Singer did.

DEAN

Did

BEVERLY

Bobby? Never heard of him. But you can fill us in over the weekend, huh.

DEAN

The weekend?

HEDDY

Didn’t the attorney tell you? Service was today and the reading of the will tomorrow.

BEVERLY

Oh but you’re welcome to spend the night. All the rooms sleep two.

HEDDY

[slaps Dean’s butt] Or three.

DEAN

Okay.

AMBER

Where’s Colette?

PHILLIP

She quit. Poor dear was so distraught over Mrs. LaCroix’s passing. Went off to find herself.

HEDDY

Ashram in India?

PHILLIP

Uh, clown college in Sarasota.

HEDDY

Good choice.

PHILLIP

[walks up to Sam and Dean] May I have a word with you in the hall in five minutes?

SAM

Sure

DEAN

Yeah.

BEVERLY

So Sam, tell me…do you work out?

[Phillip is walking down the hall with an envelope as Dean and Sam exit the billiard room into the hall.]

DEAN

Charmed I’m sure…what are these people?

SAM

I think they’re called W.A.S.P.S

DEAN

What?

[Sam sees Phillip approaching and clears his throat]

PHILLIP

My apologies for being so oblique back there, but I’m doing you boys a favor.

SAM

Okay

PHILLIP

As you know, Mrs. LaCroix bequeathed something to your Mister Singer. But the reading of the will isn’t until tomorrow and I would hate for you to have to stick around and be forced to – well mingle with the family.

DEAN

Don’t worry Alfred, we know which one the shrimp fork is. Kind of.

PHILLIP

Oh Mr. Winchester, if you’re implying that I don’t think you’re good enough, it’s quite the contrary. You’re far too good. The LaCroix family is… How shall I say this politely? …money grubbing leaches.

DEAN

What are you talking about? I thought they were all loaded.

PHILLIP

Loaded – yes; Rich – no. The recession hit every one of them and I’m afraid it they knew what Bunny left you, those vultures would try to stake claim. And since the attorney kindly agreed to a hand-off, you don’t have to be subjected to their scrutiny. [He hands the envelope to Dean]

SAM

Do you have any idea how Bunny and Bobby knew each other?

[Olivia enters hallway]

PHILLIP

Not in the slightest. Um, now if there’s nothing else, shall I have Olivia show you out?

DEAN

No, no. That’s uh…we got it. Thanks. [Olivia and Phillip head back down the hall. Dean opens the envelope. He pulls out a large jeweled cross on a chain.]

DEAN

Huh. Kind of fancy to leave a guy like Bobby.

SAM

You thinking what I’m thinking?

DEAN

If Bunny was banging Bobby, then maybe these rocks are real.

[Interior of a pawn shop]

DEAN

What do you mean it’s not real? The old bag was rolling in it.

PAWN SHOP EMPLOYEE

Well, looks like the old bag’s got a soft spot for fake rubies and cubic zirconium. This is interesting though. [pulls the top of the cross off the neckace] It’s a key.

SAM

[to Dean] A key to what?

DEAN

There’s one way to find out – Ask Jeeves.

[Interior of a bedroom in Bunny’s mansion]

STANTON

Beverly saw you sexting at dinner!

AMBER

Bev doesn’t know what the hell she’s talking about. I was texting my mom.

STANTON

An emoticon of a peeled banana?

AMBER

She like fruit.

STANTON

Just admit it. You’re cheating.

AMBER

And you’re drunk. Not to mention paranoid. [points to portrait on wall of Bunny and her husband] Just like Lance. He was always accusing poor Bunny of sleeping around.

STANTON

Because she was. My sister was nothing but a two-bit hooker in Chanel!

AMBER

How dare you? Your sister’s dead. [she goes into the bathroom and slams the door]

STANTON

[at portrait] What the hell are you looking at? Good riddance to you both. [a voice says “Stanton”] What?!

AMBER [from behind closed door]

I didn’t say anything

[voice: “Stanton”. Stanton opens the bedroom doors and walks out into the hallway. He hears the voice again as he walks down the hall looking around. Suddenly Lance is in front of him with an axe.]

STANTON

No, Ahhh

[As Amber comes out the bedroom door into the hall, Lance chops Stanton’s head off and Amber screams.]

ACT TWO
[Sam and Dean park the Impala in front of Bunny’s mansion and see a police car. Sam rings the doorbell. Phillip opens the door.]

DEAN

Everything okay?

PHILLIP

Not really. [Holding the door open as Dean and Sam enter]

DEAN

Yeah.

SAM

Thanks.

PHILLIP

I presume you gentlemen left something behind. I’ll check the front closet for burlap.

DEAN

I got news for you Mr. Belvedere the jacket’s canvas.

DETECTIVE HOWARD

You two were here earlier?

DEAN

Yeah, who wants to know?

DETECTIVE HOWARD

[flashes badge] Detective Howard. New Canaan P.D. Congratulations boys, you’re now officially murder suspects.

DEAN

I’m sorry, what?

DETECTIVE HOWARD

Yeah, Bunny LaCroix’s brother Stanford was killed this evening. His body’s just gone to the morgue.

DEAN

And you think…

DETECTIVE HOWARD

I don’t know what to think. And that’s why you two and anyone else who stepped foot in this house today is being detained for questioning.

[Dean and Sam enter the Lounge]

HEDDY

Beverly let go of me. It’s so obvious she’s guilty.

DASH

You’re off your rocker, old lady.

HEDDY

Old lady? I… [notices Sam and Dean] I’m 39.

DASH

And you have been since ’03.

HEDDY

How – how dare you?

SAM

I’m sorry to interrupt but – but who’s guilty?

HEDDY

The town slut, Amber. She killed Stan.

DASH

And what’s her motive, Murder She Wrote?

HEDDY

Oh everyone knows that Amber was sleeping around. She wanted to leave Stan but her prenup was ironclad. So she killed him.

DEAN

Sounds logical.

HEDDY

Well, unless you believe that ridiculous story that she’s been peddling. A ghost killed Stanton. Honestly.

SAM

Uh, a ghost?

HEDDY

She’s claiming that Bunny’s late husband, Lance did it. Have you ever heard such a thing? What a panic! So stupid.

DASH

You’re nutty as a squirrel on those synthetic hormones.

HEDDY

Nutty? How appalling of you. Don’t they teach you manners in Harvard?

DEAN

So uh…

SAM

Looks like we might have a case here. Vengeful spirit?

DEAN

Yeah. Think we can get to the car, get the EMF?

SAM

Not with uh Detective Friendly. Not a chance. Guess we’re gonna have to go old school.

DEAN

All right, cold spots it is.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

You stay here. Keep an eye on Mrs. Peacock and Colonel Mustard. I’ll sniff around.

SAM

Alright. [Dean exits and Beverly is waving at Sam]

HEDDY

For your information I already own a big, beautiful yacht.

DASH

Oh, is that what you call that thing?

HEDDY

Fine, it’s a mahogany sunfish.

[Dean is walking down an upstairs hallway. He peers into the helmet of a suit of armor.]

[Back in the Lounge Sam walks up to Dash]

SAM

Hey. Got to say for a family that just lost two members, you all seem…fine.

DASH

Well Sam, I’ll let you in on a little family secret. We don’t really like each other. Then again, what family does?

SAM

Mine does. Uh, for the most part. It’s just my brother and me, so…

DASH

Then you’re lucky. Trust me, it’s a miracle we’ve been under the same roof for 24 hours and haven’t – Oops…my bad.

SAM

And, uh—why are you so sure Amber didn’t do it?

DASH

Because Amber’s not a killer. She has trouble using WiFi. I don’t exactly think she’s capable of murder.

[Dean is walking down another hallway past a bedroom to where the outline of Stanford’s body and head are. He sees a book in a bookcase with a cross that matches the necklace on the cover. He pulls out the book and the bookcase opens revealing a hidden door.]

[Interior of the Lounge]

SAM

And her story about the ghost?

DASH

I don’t believe in ghosts. That said, if anyone would come back to haunt, it’s Uncle Lance. Heard he was a real bastard. No one really mourned his death except Aunt Bunny who became a recluse after he died. So maybe the old goat has a chip on his shoulder. Who the hell knows?

DETECTIVE HOWARD

[walks in Lounge with Amber] Dash, you’re up. [Dash passes Amber and exits with the Detective.]

[Dean pulls the key from the cross necklace and uses it to open the secret door behind the bookcase. As he enters, he picks up a pipe and then some rope. Holding the pipe, Dean climbs the stairs and switches on his flashlight as he enters the attic. He sees a rolled up rug with feet sticking out then hears footsteps.]

OLIVIA

Dean?

DEAN

Olivia?

OLIVIA

Thank God! I thought you were him.

DEAN

Him – who?

OLIVIA

Phillip, the butler. He locked me in here because I wouldn’t lie to the detective about what I saw.

DEAN

What did you see?

OLIVIA

I saw him roll Colette’s body in a rug.

DEAN

Clown college Colette? The butler killed her?

OLIVIA

No, no. He just – he just hid her.

DEAN

Then who killed her?

OLIVIA

I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I saw it with my own eyes.

DEAN

Let me guess - Lance’s ghost.

OLIVIA

No – Bunny’s.

[In the Lounge, Sam is playing cards with Heddy and Beverly. Dean and Olivia enter.]

SAM

You know what, uh, excuse me.

BEVERLY

No, no stay.

SAM

Hey. So?

DEAN

You seen the butler?

SAM

No. Why?

DEAN

Cause if anybody has answers it’s him. We’re dealing with two vengeful spirits. Apparently Aunt Bunny had a bee in her bonnet as well.

SAM

Uh husband and wife tag-team killer ghosts?

DEAN

Well, got to keep the marriage alive somehow. The key is to a hidden attic.

SAM

Why would Bunny want Bobby to have a key to her attic?

DEAN

I don’t know. It gets weirder. I found Olivia and Colette locked inside.

SAM

Clown college Colette?

DEAN

Yeah, but she ain’t studying balloon animals. She’s dead.

SAM

Now what does the butler have to do with all this?

DEAN

He’s the one who locked them in there. Now I don’t know why, but he’s covering for the spooks. He’s acting like their Renfield.

SAM

Alright, we’ve got to find him. I’ll take upstairs. You take down here.

DEAN

Alright.

[Sam heads upstairs]

DETECTIVE HOWARD

Sam Winchester! [Sam hurries down the upstairs hall] Where did you run off to?

BEVERLY

Well, well, well. What do we have here? Whatcha doing snooping around these halls, hmmm?

SAM

Uh…

BEVERLY

Up to no good? Why don’t we get up to no good together? You know they say women just get better with age. Like a fine wine or – or cheese.

SAM

Uh, I – I uh – I’m lactose intolerant, so.

BEVERLY

Oh come on, Sammy. Don’t be coy. We have a good ten minutes before my interrogation. And I bet a young buck like you can do a lot in ten minutes.

SAM

I’m right behind you.

BEVERLY [entering the bedroom]

Right behind me, oh. Could you just give me a hand with this zipper. I always have such a hard time… [Sam is already gone – he had rushed down the hall.]

[Dean on the first floor finds the door to the Butler’s quarters. He picks up a large wrench and enters.]

PHILLIP

Uh, leaky faucet’s down the hall.

DEAN

Cut the crap, Wadsworth. What are you doing hiding dead maids in secret rooms?

PHILLIP

I know it all looks rather peculiar, but I can explain.

[Sam enters the kitchen. He sees blood on the floor and takes a knife. He finds Phillip’s dead body with a knife sticking out of his back. Sam pulls out his cell phone.]

ACT THREE
[Interior of Phillip’s quarters]

DEAN

So you hid Colette’s body in the attic so that she wouldn’t steal Bunny’s thunder?

PHILLIP

I couldn’t stand the thought of overshadowing Mrs. LaCroix’s funeral with another death. She deserved a proper farewell. I owed it to her.

DEAN

Well that’s crazy.

PHILLIP

No, Mr. Winchester, that’s loyalty.

[Dean receives a text from Sam: “Just found Phillip. Dead.” Dean turns toward Phillip and Phillip throws him across the room. As Dean gets back up, he sees the pile of clothes and skin by the door. He dials his cell phone]

SAM

Dean.

DEAN

Sam.

SAM

Yeah?

DEAN

It’s no ghost.

SAM

What?

DEAN

It’s a shapeshifter.

[Sam and Dean are standing near Phillip’s body past the kitchen.]

SAM

So the shifter’s getting its jollies by impersonating dead people.

DEAN

Yeah. First Bunny, then Lance, now Phillip. Guess we can rule out “the butler did it.”

SAM

[Sam and Dean re-enter the kitchen] And the creep just shed so now it could be anybody. Even you.

DEAN

Or you. We need to find some silver.

[Olivia enters and sees Phillip.]

OLIVIA

Oh my God!

DEAN

Hey. He was like that when we found him.

OLIVIA

Who did this?

SAM

We don’t know yet, okay? Now, listen. Calm down. I know you think he was working with ghosts but there’s something way worse going on here.

OLIVIA

Worse than…What is going on?

DEAN

If you want to help, then help. Can you do that?

[Olivia opens a silverware case.]

OLIVIA

Why do you need the silverware?

SAM

For protection.

OLIVIA

Butter knives?

DEAN

Trust us. There’s a method to our madness.

SAM

[hands silver knife to Olivia] Can you – uh – hold this? [Olivia holds the knife. Sam picks up another silver knife and hands to Dean.] Dean. [Dean holds the knife.] All right. [Sam picks up another knife]. Let’s do this.

[Beverly and Heddy are sitting on a couch in the Lounge scrolling through men’s pictures in a dating app on an iPad.]

BEVERLY

No – No – No – No! Ugh!

HEDDY

Wait, wait, wait. Go back. He owned an island.

BEVERLY

And a harelip.

HEDDY

Who cares if he’s ugly if you’re drinking Mai Tai’s in the lap of luxury?

SAM

Hey. Hey, ladies.

HEDDY

Hi.

SAM

What are you doing?

HEDDY

Trying to find Beverly a man.

BEVERLY

I’ve resorted to fishing online because the live ones won’t bite.

SAM

You mean back there? I - I was just playing hard to get.

BEVERLY

Well, then…you’re a very convincing actor. [motions for Sam to sit on the couch] Come.

SAM

Sure. Alright [Sam walks over to the couch.]

BEVERLY

[Beverly pushes Heddy over ] Sit here. Yes. [Sam sits between them.]

BEVERLY

Ah. Oh. Mmm. [Sam has a silver butter knife under his shirt cuff to the underside of his right hand. He puts his hand on Beverly’s bare leg.]

HEDDY

Boo. I’m feeling so left out.

SAM

Well then, uh, come on in darling. Water’s warm. [Sam has a silver butter knife under his shirt cuff to the underside of his left hand. He puts his arm around HEDDY with his hand on her bare shoulder.]

HEDDY

Oh. Oh yes.

[Dean enters the Billiard room. He’s about to exit and hears something in the closet. He takes a silver candlestick and opens the closet doors to find Amber and Dash kissing.]

DEAN

Really?

AMBER

We can explain.

DEAN

Let me guess. You two got bored last Christmas.

DASH

New Canaan clambake, actually. We were in line at the buffet, they ran out of steamers. One thing led to another, and, well…

AMBER

But we didn’t kill Stanton.

DASH

We may be guilty of cheating but not murder.

DEAN

[Dean pulls two silver butterknives out of his pocket.] Touch these.

DASH

What? Why?

DEAN

Do it or I go cards up on your whole clambake. [Dash and Amber touch the knives]

AMBER

Did… we pass?

DEAN

Yep. Don’t worry, your secret is safe with me. Come on you two.

[Interior of the Lounge. Sam is still sitting between Beverly and Heddy on the couch. Beverly is touching his hair and Heddy is touching his fingers.]

HEDDY

Did you see how long his fingers his fingers were?

SAM

There…there’s just.

HEDDY

First of all, did you see this? Look how long…

DEAN

Should I come back when you’re done?

SAM

Oh, he’s – he’s – he’s calling to me, so…[Sam gets up from the couch].

DEAN

And it’s all going to hell, right here, right now. [Sam is now by Dean.]

Sorry to interrupt.

SAM

Pfft. Gray Gardens cleared.

DEAN

Okay, well so is Dash and Amber. They’re a thing, by the way.

SAM

Y—

DEAN

Yeah, W.A.S.P.S.

SAM

Well, so that’s everyone. Except for… [Olivia screams.]

[Sam and Dean reach Olivia down the hall. She’s pointing in a bathroom. Sam and Dean enter the bathroom. Detective Howard is dead with his head in the toilet. Everyone else is in the doorway.]

DEAN

Well, we got a floater.

SAM

Great. [Everyone else comes in the bathroom.]

DEAN

Yeah, he’s a goner.

HEDDY

Drowned in a toilet? How filthy.

BEVERLY

What kind of monster would do such a thing? [Heddy and Beverly turn to Olivia.]

OLIVIA

Don’t look at me. I was just trying to pee.

DEAN

Okay, hold on. Before we start pointing fingers…

HEDDY

Amber has motive. She killed the detective because she knew that it was just a matter of time before he figured out she killed Stan.

DASH

Bravo Rizzoli! You solved the case. Want to weigh in too, Isles?

AMBER

I didn’t kill Stanton or the detective. And I have proof.

SAM

Okay, guys…

AMBER

My alibi is in this room.

DEAN

Ooh, wait for it.

DASH

Amber couldn’t have killed the detective cause she was with me. We’re in love.

AMBER

We’re sleeping together.

BEVERLY

I knew it.

HEDDY

Well then you have motive too. You offed Stan because you were diddling his wife.

DASH

Oh. The old lady doth protest too much. You’re only pointing the finger to distract from your own guilt. And you probably got Baby Jane to help.

BEVERLY

Well I never! I’m leaving.

DEAN

All right, hang on. First of all, who talks like that? Second of all, no one’s leaving, okay?

BEVERLY

[grabbing Dean] Ohh, get your hands off me young man.

DEAN

Okay, see - I don’t trust anyone. And leaving just makes you look guilty.

BEVERLY

Ohhh

SAM

Dean is right, okay. We have four corpses now.

AMBER

Four corpses?

DEAN

Yes. You can add Phillip and Colette to the list.

HEDDY

Clown college Colette? But I thought she…

DEAN

She’s dead! Alright, she’s dead.

SAM

And we can’t help you unless you stop arguing with one another. You need to trust us.

DASH

Trust you? Uh, we don’t even know you. Look Buddy, I’m trying to be objective here, but we’ve had countless family functions before, and even though we wanted to kill one another, we never did.

HEDDY

Dash is right. Our get-togethers never end in murder. The only thing different this time around is you.

DEAN

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. First of all, whoa. Whatever you’re suggesting…

DASH

[grabs detective’s gun] You two! Let’s go. Don’t even think about it. I….hunt pheasant. [Dash holds the gun on Sam and Dean and puts them in a room.] Sit tight until the cops get here.

DEAN

You don’t want to do this. We are your best shot at making it out of here alive.

SAM

We’re not the bad guys, Dash.

DASH

I beg to differ. You’re wearing flannel. [Dash shuts and locks the door.]

DEAN

Hey! [Dean tries to open the door. He takes a silver butter knife and tries to force the door open. Sam is rifling through drawers and finds keys.]

SAM

Hey. Keys.

DEAN

No, it’s locked from the outside.

SAM

Are you kidding me? Great.

DEAN

[Dean stops trying to force the door open with the silver butter knife and sees the knife is bent.] Made in Taiwan. Freaking stainless steel.

SAM

So that’s why no one sizzled? They’re not even real silver?

DEAN

First cubic zirconium and now this. No wonder the rich stay rich. How we gonna kill this thing?

SAM

You know, we got silver bullets in the trunk.

DEAN

Yeah, assuming we ever make it out of here.

[In the Lounge]

AMBER

I don’t get it. Why would Sam and Dean want us dead?

DASH

Isn’t it obvious? [waving the gun around] They wanted our inheritance. Guess whatever Aunt Bunny left them wasn’t good enough.

HEDDY

For the love of God Dash, put down the gun before you kill someone!

DASH

It’s okay. I….Hunt….Pheasant!

AMBER

Put it down! [Dash puts the gun down on the coffee table.]

HEDDY

I knew those boys were trailer trash the moment they rolled up in that American-made.

BEVERLY

Not to mention homosexuals.

HEDDY

Ugh. Homosexual murderers. Like Leopold and Loeb.

BEVERLY

Only hotter.

[Olivia enters the room.]

HEDDY

Oh. Call the police at once.

OLIVIA

Oh, I don’t think so.

HEDDY

Excuse me, young lady? Killer or no killer, you’re still on the clock.

OLIVIA

You idiots couldn’t be more wrong…about everything. Don’t you know, if it’s not the butler, it’s the maid? [Olivia picks up the gun and points it at them.]

[In the locked room, Sam sees Olivia with the gun on the Security feed.]

SAM

Dean. You gotta see this.

DEAN

We got played by the maid.

[Dean throws himself against the door]

Both doors are reinforced.

[In the Lounge]

OLIVIA

I’m not the maid.

HEDDY

Well, that explains the dust.

OLIVIA

I’m Bunny’s daughter.

BEVERLY

What are you talking about? Bunny didn’t have a child.

OLIVIA

Oh, yes she did – a very devoted one. I loved mother more than anything, which is more than I can say for any of you.

DASH

Then where have you been hiding all these years?

OLIVIA

The attic.

AMBER

Like in the movie.

HEDDY

Oh, Amber.

[Sam opens a cabinet while Dean watches the surveillance video.]

OLIVIA

Outside of mother, Phillip was the only one at the manor who knew. So after she died, he took pity on me, and he let me out. He told me to pose as the new maid so I can hide in plain sight.

AMBER

That’s why you killed Colette – for her job?

OLIVIA

Oh no, no, no, no. Colette was just an accident. I just wanted to scare her because I caught her stealing.

HEDDY

Well that doesn’t explain wanting us dead. None of us are thieves.

OLIVIA

Oh, no. You’re worse. Your greed. Your disdain. Your blatant disrespect for mother. Oh. You all had it coming!

DASH

But, why kill Phillip? I mean, if he was on your side…

OLIVIA

Because he turned on me. After Stanton, he locked me back up. Lucky for me, the cute, dumb one let me out.

[In locked room, Sam opens a cabinet.]

SAM

Gunsafe.

DEAN

Hey. [tosses keys to Sam] Try these.

HEDDY

No wonder you were locked away. You’re a monster!

OLIVIA

Oh, you have no idea.

[Sam opens the gunsafe and takes out a gun. He’s pointing it at the locked door.]

[In the Lounge, they hear the gun blast.]

DASH

What in God’s name.

OLIVIA

Shut up! [She’s aiming her gun at the entrance to the Lounge. As Sam enters, she shoots at him and runs out a different door as the rest of the family cowers.]

SAM

Stay here. [He exits the same door that Olivia used.]

HEDDY

Did anyone else wet themselves?

[Sam enters the kitchen and Olivia fires shots at him. Sam ducks down behind the kitchen island.]

OLIVIA

You don’t have a clear shot.

SAM

Neither do you.

OLIVIA

Killing you is the next best thing to killing Bobby Singer.

SAM

What’s your beef with Bobby?

OLIVIA

For starters, he killed my father.

SAM

Lance was a shifter?

OLIVIA

Lance wasn’t my father. Mother had an affair with a shifter. She got pregnant, told Lance I was his. He bought it….until she brought me back from the hospital. My real dad was waiting. Lance put up a fight, but he was no match for a shifter. And just as my dad was about to take me….the hunter became the hunted.

SAM

Bobby.

OLIVIA

After Bobby killed my father, he came after me. Mother pleaded with him to spare me. He agreed, under one condition.

SAM

That she keep you locked up.

OLIVIA

For my safety, and the safety of others. Mother told the family she lost the baby. And she locked me in the attic. But she remained devoted to me until the very end – Even got Bobby to promise to take care of me if anything happened to her.

SAM

Wait a minute. Then, Bobby spared you. You should be grateful.

OLIVIA

For what? Keeping me locked up my whole life? It would have been kinder to kill me.

SAM

Olivia…you don’t have to do this. Being a monster is a choice.

OLIVIA

That choice was made for me a long time ago. Why haven’t you taken a shot? Oh, you don’t have any silver bullets, do you?

[Olivia is now pointing the gun directly at Sam. She’s shot from behind by Dean. After she drops, Dean shoots her 7 more times.]

[Sam, Dean, and the family are walking out the front door. Dash is talking on his cell phone.]

DASH

Yes, officer. Yes, thank you very much. Yes, no you can’t miss it. Big house on the end of the street. Alright, bye now. [Dash heads to Sam and Dean.] Guys? Police are on the way. What a mess. I owe you two an apology.

SAM

Don’t sweat it. I mean, you were just protecting your family and…there’s nothing wrong with that.

DASH

So I spoke to Aunt Bunny’s attorney. He said outside from the pendant, everything was left to Olivia.

DEAN

Hey, you know what? Speaking of that…you guys should keep it. [Dean hands the pendant to Dash.] It’s a key to the attic.

DASH

Bobby must have really meant something to Aunt Bunny. How can we repay you?

DEAN

You know what? Just forget we were ever here.

DASH

But you saved our lives. I want everyone to know what heroes you…

DEAN

Look pal, the fact that we pulled your bacon out of the fire is nobody’s business. Okay? Hey. I’m serious Izod. Put a pin in it. Or we’ll come back for your preppy ass.

[Sam and Dean drive off the estate in the Impala.]

SAM

Dean, what was that all about back there?

DEAN

What are you talking about?

SAM

I mean….all those extra shots after the shifter was already dead. What was that?

DEAN

I don’t know. Target practice?

SAM

Come on, man. I’m serious. You sure it wasn’t….I don’t know, demon residue or something to do with the mark, or…

DEAN

No. No, none of that.

SAM

Right. Look man, I got to be honest…

DEAN

Oh my God, Sam. It was my first kill since I’ve been back. You know, I got a little anxious. I wanted to make sure it was done right – plain and simple. Its… Why am I even explaining this to you? [Dean blasts the stereo.]

SAM

Dean, I… [Sam stops talking, shakes his head, and looks out the window.]
