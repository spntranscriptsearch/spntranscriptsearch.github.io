NOW

Nighttime.

Scene opens at a waterfall.


Music is blaring on the radio.

The camera pans over the top of a red station wagon parked in the parking lot that overlooks the waterfall and river it’s flowing into. As the song plays on the radio the camera is now inside the car and we watch a couple of teenagers make out. The camera is now outside the car towards the left front side and we see a BLUE VAN drive in from the adjoining road into the parking lot. The camera moves back inside the car and the teenagers are still making out. A shadowy figure runs by the car. The Girl notices and stops kissing the boy.

♪ oh, oh, oh ♪♪ my hands are tied ♪♪ 'cause if I tried ♪♪ to leave this place, I'd surely die ♪♪ hey ♪♪ hey ♪♪ hey ♪♪ I'd surely die ♪



KRISSY


What was that?


SONG ON RADIO


♪ I'd surely die ♪


BOY

What?


SONG ON RADIO

♪ Hey ♪


Krissy turns around in her seat to look all the way around the car.


BOY

There's no one out here but us, Krissy.


BOY continues to kiss KRISSY


SONG ON RADIO

♪ Hey ♪♪ hey ♪♪ I'd surely die ♪


BOY then also sees someone running around the car.


BOY

What?


SONG ON RADIO

♪ I'd surely die ♪


BOY

No, no. No, no, no.


Someone continues to run around the car rapidly. And suddenly the car’s hood flips up. The teenagers seem to become scared and the BOY tries to start the car.


BOY

Okay.


The car won’t start. The BOY grabs a knife from the back seat area and starts to get out of the car


KRISSY

No. No. Don't leave me here! Aiden! Don't leave me here!


ADIAN gets out of the car and closes the door.


KRISSY

Oh, God.


Suddenly the window next to KRISSY shatters and a MAN pulls her out of the car. AIDEN comes up behind the MAN and cuts his head off using the knife he retrieved from the back seat. KRISSY picks herself up and JOSEPHINE comes running up, holding a small shotgun, from off-screen and walks up to AIDEN and KRISSY. While ADIEN stares at the body he seems to be thinking about what he just did. KRISSY calmly walks around the body stepping over part of it.



JOSEPHINE

You okay?


KRISSY

That was close. Next time one of you can be the bait.


Krissy walks over with the other two to look at the head on the ground.

ADIEN looks visible upset as he says:


AIDEN

It's him.


KRISSY

One down. Two to go.




OPENING TITLE FOR SUPERNATURAL SEASON 8

EPISODE 18:FREAKS AND GEEKS


DAYTIME


The camera is looking down an empty street towards a T intersection. A Sheriff car drives out of the Sheriff station parking lot that’s on the left and turns left and as it comes to the end if the T intersection and is about to turn left as the IMPALA drives in from the left and takes a turns towards the camera. The IMPALA take a right hand turn into the Sheriff Station parking lot. Dean is driving and he parks the car in one of the parking lot spaces.


SAM

So, what are we looking at again?


DEAN reaches into the back seat and hands SAM a newspaper. SAM reads his summary of what the paper says out loud.


SAM

"Two young women found near the freeway with their throats ripped out."


DEAN

Sounds vampy to me.


SAM

Yeah, maybe.


DEAN

Listen, if you want to take a knee on this one if you're not feeling up to it...


SAM

What?


DEAN

You know, the trials, what Cas said that you got what he can't cure.


SAM

Hmm, which means what, exactly?


DEAN

Well, I don't know. You tell me. Are you okay?


SAM

I'm fine. Are you okay?


DEAN

Me?


SAM

Yeah. Um,

Cas dinged you up pretty good.


DEAN

And?


SAM

And I just wanted to make sure

you're okay.


DEAN

What like my feelings?


SAM

If that's what you want to talk about, sure.


DEAN

Okay. I'll tell you what. Why don't I go get some, uh, herbal tea.


SAM

Okay.


DEAN

And you can find some Cowboy Junkies on the dial.


SAM

Eat me, Dean.


SAM gets out of the IMPALA


DEAN

And you know what? We'll just talk it out.


SAM slams the IMPALA door.


DEAN

Good talk.


DEAN gets out of the IMPALA and starts walking toward the Sheriff station after SAM.


DEAN

Nay, great talk! Very healthy!


SAM and DEAN are now seen inside the Sheriff station standing in a hallway showing their “FBI” badges to a SHERIFF.


SHERIFF

FBI? You're here about the Lady Killer Murders, aren't you?


SAM

The Lady Killer Murders?


SHERIFF

Yeah, coined it myself.


DEAN

Congratulations. What can you tell us?


The SHERIFF begins to walk and talk with the brothers to a desk in the busy Sheriff station.


SHERIFF

Well, both victims were female, under 21, and here's the kicker --

they were drained of all their blood.


SAM

Huh.


SHERIFF

Exactly. We found that strange, also. But then last night, things got even stranger.


SAM

Last night?


SHERIFF

Yeah.


The SHERIFF turns the computer monitor on his desk to show the brothers a surveillance video taken the night before.


SHERIFF

We set up a security cam on Fuller's Point for safety purposes. It’s where our local young people like to go make out. Last night, things got crazy.


The SHERIFF then presses play on the video and the brothers watch the scene that played out with KRISSY, ADIEN and JOSEPHINE the night before.

As he watches DEAN recognizes KRISSY from an earlier case he worked on with SAM. DEAN doesn’t say anything.


SHERIFF

Hell of a thing, ain't it?


SAM

Uh, you I.D. any of these people?


SHERIFF

Well, not yet. Crime scene was empty when we got there. No vic, no nothing.

Uh, I'm thinking it's some kind of cult or a drug thing. So I put a statewide A.P.B. out on these three about an hour ago.


DEAN

I'm gonna need you to call that off. And we're gonna need this footage.


SHERIFF

What?


DEAN

Sheriff, why do you think we're here? You just crossed streams with a federal investigation.

Now, I suggest you cooperate, call off your A.P.B., or you're gonna find yourself in a world of hurt.


The SHERIFF looks confuses but compliant.


SHERIFF

Uh...Right.


SAM and DEAN walk out of the sheriff’s station and back to the IMPALA.


SAM

So, what was that all about, G-man?


DEAN

You remember Krissy Chambers?


SAM

Uh, yeah, the Vetalas case, right? They were working that truck stop by the freeway. She and her dad

helped us shut 'em down.


DEAN

Right, and then he promised to go civilian so she wouldn't grow up to be a hunter. Well, guess who the star

of this snuff film is?


SAM

Come on. Well, maybe he doesn't know she's doing this.


DEAN

What, sneaking out in the middle of the night to go hunt monsters with the Apple Dumpling gang?

Is that what kids are doing for kicks these days?


SAM

Okay. Then maybe he knows, and he's helping her out.

DEAN

What, get caught on "Candid Camera"? Let's just go find her before she gets into any more trouble.


DEAN and SAM get into the IMPALA with DEAN driving. As SAM gets in he looks frustrated.


¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬

NIGHTIME


KRISSY is standing at a counter showing a fake Kansas STATE ID to a HOTEL CLERK.


CLERK

You're 25?


KRISSY reaches into her pocket and pulls out two twenties and sets them on the counter.


KRISSY

Actually, I think I'm 40.


The CLERK gives her a half smile as he takes the money and hands her a room key. KRISSY takes the key and walks down a hallway away from the hotel counter.


Inside the hotel room KRISSY takes out a laptop while AIDEN looks in some bags. AIDEN stops what he is doing and walks up behind KRISSY and starts to put his arms around her but KRISSY stops him.


KRISSY

I told you...I have a boyfriend.


AIDEN

Then how come I couldn't find him in your cellie?


KRISSY

Because we only Skype.


AIDEN

Right. And let me guess --he also lives in Canada?


KRISSY

You know, he does, actually. Oh. A small town called "kiss my ass."


AIDEN

Okay. But... You sure were giving off a different vibe in the car.


JOSEPHINE walks into the hotel room.


KRISSY

Good. You're back. Let's do this. Vamp was last seen by an ATM camera checking into this hotel.

I tapped into the hotel's security cams and found him. Room 215.


All three look at the ATM video. Then AIDEN puts on a headset with a camera and mic attached.


ADIEN

Okay. Let's do this.


KRISSY

You transmitting?


ADIEN is wearing a mic and headcam and to show he is transmitting he kisses the end of the mic that is on the cord to his headset. KRISSY rolls her eyes and looks at JOSEPHINE and both girls sigh.


ADIAN

You bet.


The girls turn to look at the laptop that shows live video of the hotel room door that the VAMP is staying in. The JOSEPHINE grabs a big handgun off the table. AIDEN slides a machete into a sheath attached to his side.


JOSEPHINE

He alone?


KRISSY

I can't tell.


AIDEN

Hey, how about we start a new tradition, and before each job, we give each other good-luck kisses?


JOSEPHINE

How about I punch you in the throat instead?


The JOSEPHINE rolls her eyes and turns to walk out of the room as KRISSY smiles mockingly at AIDEN and he then puts a backpack over his shoulder and follows JOSEPHINE out of the hotel room.


AIDEN watches JOSEPHINE walk in front of him and she turns her head to talk to him as the walk down the hallway towards the VAMPS room.


JOSEPHINE

You know you're not gonna get anywhere with Krissy with those cheesy moves.


AIDEN

How about you stop putting salt in my game and mind your own business?


JOSEPHINE also has a headcam on that she looks through when AIDEN responds to her. KRISSY is able to watch the conversation back in their hotel room and she rolls her eyes.


ADIEN sees something on the floor so he squats down to get a closer look. He smudges the substance with two fingers and holds his hand up so it can be seen.


JOSEPHINE

Blood?


AIDEN lock picks the VAMPS room. KRISSY watches the live video intently on her laptop.

The door to the teenager’s hotel room opens slowly as SAM steps inside after picking the lock. SAM and DEAN step into the room and look around. Suddenly there is a gun clicking sound and the camera pans so that you see KRISSY standing off to DEAN'S left just behind him. DEAN doesn’t look at KRISSY before he says:


DEAN

Hey, Krissy.


KRISSY

What are you two doing here?


DEAN

Saving your bacon, that's what.


KRISSY

Does it look like my bacon needs saving? Wait. How'd you find me? I paid cash everywhere.


DEAN

Only two hotels within a 20-mile radius, and we paid cash, too -- just more.


KRISSY

Freaking clerk.


SAM

Krissy, where's your dad?


KRISSY

Dead. Well, let's do this again, like, never. Now go. We got this.


SAM

We who?


DEAN

And got what?


While the brothers ask KRISSY questions the other two teenagers are slipping slowly into the VAMP'S room. KRISSY walks back over to the laptop to watch.


KRISSY

A vampire.


DEAN

Sorry. A what?


The brothers walk over to watch the live video with KRISSY. They see a hotel room with a woman strapped to a bed.


JOSEPHINE

We're in. The room's clear. Nobody here but a vic.


We continue to see the VAMPS room on live video when a loud noise happens and AIDEN turns around to see the VAMP behind them after the VAMP slammed the door. The VAMP is hissing and he tosses JOSEPHINE into a wall and then he and AIDEN do a stand off when DEAN and SAM rush into the room through the door behind the VAMP. The VAMP turns and sees DEAN and SAM and then run and jumps out the nearby closed window. Dean walks over to the window and looks out. They are on the second story. The VAMP runs across the street and the BLUE VAN that showed up the night that AIDEN and KRISSY were making out in the car is across the street running.


KRISSY

I got him!


KRISSY runs out of the hotel room to chase the VAMP.


DEAN

You –


Steps away from the window angrily to chase after KRISSY and the VAMP.


DEAN

son of a bitch.


SAM

We need to call an ambulance!


JOSEPHINE

Ambulance is on its way. She's in shock. I'll stabilize her. We'll leave her here for the paramedics.


DEAN bursts out of a sidedoor of the hotel and begins to run down the street where KRISSY is holding a tranq gun up chasing the VAMP.


VAMP

Please!

Don't shoot me!


KRISST shoots the VAMP in the leg next to his knee and he falls to the ground and turns over to face KRISSY and DEAN who is now standing next to KRISSY.


VAMP

Don't shoot me! Please, don't --Please...It hurts so bad!


DEAN

How did you drop him so quickly?


KRISSY

Darts filled with dead man's blood.


DEAN

Where's the blue van?


KRISSY

What blue van?


DEAN

The blue van that he was seen bolting to? Never mind.


DEAN takes out a knife from a side holster to kill the VAMP.



KRISSY

Wait, stop! This is not your kill.


DEAN

What are you talking about?


JOSEPHINE

Three months ago, this blood banger snuck into a house and killed three people in their sleep.


VAMP

What?! No! I didn't do that!


JOSEPHINE

One was a woman --never hurt anyone! The other two, a brother and a sister.


VAMP

I don't know what you're talking about.


JOSEPHINE I came home from a friend's house, and I found them. They were my family!


VAMP

This isn't happening. I didn't do anything, I swear. Please, help me!


JOSEPHINE ignores the VAMP and takes a machete that she had at her side and slices his head off. DEAN looks around hoping no one sees and SAM looks very angry. KRISSY walks up behind JOSEPHINE to comfort her.


KRISSY

It's okay. It's over.


DEAN looks at KRISSY with a scornful look.


DEAN

We need to talk to you privately.


AIDEN

You know this guy?


KRISSY

Yeah. We have a past.


DEAN

All right. So, you're gonna have to catch me up. What --did your dad, uh --he couldn't quit the life, could he?


KRISSY

No, he did. For a while, it was amazing. We had dinner every night at a table. We watched TV, went on walks.

Even went to the mall.


DEAN

And then?


KRISSY

And then...The past came a-knockin'. I woke up one morning and found him dead.......his throat ripped out.


DEAN

Well, I'm sorry.


KRISSY

Me too. If it weren't for Josephine and Aiden, I don't know how I would have made it.


DEAN

So, they both lost their families, as well?


KRISSY

Yeah, the same vamps we're hunting together --a nest.


DEAN

Well, look, I am sorry to rain on your parade, but you are way too young to be doing this.


KRISSY

You're never too young to kill monsters, especially the ones that kill your family.



DEAN

Hunting isn't all about killing and revenge. I thought we had this chat last time. Do you have any, uh --

do you have any family that's still out there?


KRISSY

An aunt in Cincinnati. Why?


DEAN

'Cause you're packing a bag, and we're taking you there.


KRISSY

I think Victor's gonna have a problem with that.


DEAN

Victor?


KRISSY

He took us in, showed us everything we know.


DEAN

Wait. So, what are we talking here? Some sort of kid's school for hunters?


KRISSY

Don't be such a dweeb, okay? We're not the X-Men. Victor's helping us get revenge.


DEAN

Yeah, well, I don't care what he is. He sucks. 'Cause you and your little crew here got caught.

And if it wasn't for me, your faces would be splattered all over the news.


KRISSY

Well, you know, so what?! Maybe it's time that people know the truth about what's really going bump

in the night.


DEAN

Oh, and cause panic? Create mayhem? Yeah, that's a great plan.


KRISSY

Look, I don't need you to save me, Dean. I'm not a little kid anymore.


KRISSY walks away from DEAN.


DEAN (silently)

Wow.


KRISSY walks over JOSEPHINE and ADIEN and helps them wrap the dead VAMP in a plastic bag.


DEAN walks over to SAM who is standing a few feet away from the teenagers.


SAM

What happened?


DEAN

Teenagers, that's what.


SAM

She tell you about Victor?

DEAN

Yeah. What do we think?


SAM

Well, didn't we meet up with a hunter named Victor one time in Spokane?


DEAN

That's a long time ago. I haven't heard about him since.


DEAN and SAM look at the kids while the finish duct tapping and wrapping the body.


SAM

All right, so, these kids are --


DEAN

Dangerous and off their meds? Yeah, no kidding.


SAM

So, what? We go and talk with Victor?


JOSEPHINE

Ready?



JOSEPHINE AND ADIEN toss the body in the back of their red station wagon. KRISSY then tosses the wrapped head in after it.


KRISSY

Okay.


KRISSY slams the back of the station wagon shut.


They slam the back of the station wagon shut.



SAME NIGHT


The IMPALA and the red station wagon pull up to a house and park and everyone gets out and heads up to the house. SAM and DEAN follow the group in.


DEAN

Not what I'd call a compound.


Everyone walks in the house which is big with two stories. SAM and DEAN step in and walk off to the left and look around.


DEAN

Huh.


KRISSY

What's wrong?


DEAN

It's just not what I expected.

KRISSY

And what was that?


DEAN

A little more "Lord of the Flies", less Huxtables.


VICTOR walks down from the second story


VICTOR

Sorry to disappoint. Victor Rogers.


SAM

We met -- a Rugaru hunt in Washington. I'm Sam. This is Dean.


VICTOR

Oh, yes. The Winchesters. Right.


JOSEPHINE walks up slowly looking at the brothers then back at VICTOR who then hugs her.


VICTOR

Hey.


JOSEPHINE

Ohh.


VICTOR

Better now?


JOSEPHINE

Much.


VICTOR

And what do we always say?


JOSEPHINE

Move on, but never forget.


VICTOR

Good. Now, don't you have a trig test in the morning?


JOSEPHINE, smiles, remembering and then walks upstairs. AIDEN walks from the kitchen with an apple in his hand. VICTOR turns to look at him questioningly.


AIDEN

Oh, I'm good, Vic. No test. I'm just gonna chill,


VICTOR

Uh-huh.


AIDAN

Play video games.


VICTOR

Yeah, keep dreaming. Because I asked you to clean your room twice and you still haven't done it.

Go on.


AIDEN rolls his eyes and walks away while taking a bite of his apple. KRISSY walks from the front room over to where VICTOR is still standing by the stairs.


VICTOR

And you.


KRISSY

A full report about the hunt on your desk by morning.


VICTOR clasps his hands together in front of his chest and slightly bows in appreciation.


KRISSY

Okay. I'll be in my room.


KRISSY walks around VICTOR and walks upstairs. VICTOR looks at SAM and DEAN.


VICTOR

Drink?


DEAN

Sure.


The next scene shows DEAN and SAM sitting on the same couch and VICTOR walking to a chair across from them and sitting down.


SAM

So, these kids go to school --like, school-school, real school?


VICTOR

Yes, and they're doing incredibly well considering all they've been through.


DEAN

Okay, so how does this work? What, after -- after soccer practice and --and the bake sale,

they, uh, chop vampires' heads off?


VICTOR

Well, yeah. I think a balanced approach is best, don't you?


DEAN

They're kids. They shouldn't be hunting at all. You got to break this up right now.


VICTOR

When I found them, they were lost, confused, angry. I gave them family and purpose.

And you want to take all that away? Why?


SAM

So they don't get killed.


VICTOR

They know the risks.


SAM

Yeah, but why take them?


VICTOR

Because the next generation of hunters has to be better.


SAM

Better than what?


VICTOR

Better than us. Oh, come on, guys. I know your friends. I mean, Martin was insane.

And somebody obviously dropped Garth on his head when he was a baby.

And I know you two loved that Bobby guy, but he was a barely functional alcoholic.


DEAN

Watch it.


VICTOR

No disrespect meant, but Josephine is an all-state athlete and National Merit scholar.

Aiden is so fast he could pick your pocket before you could even blink. And Krissy,

oh she's just a natural-born leader and hunter.


DEAN

So what?


VICTOR

So these kids are the cream of the crop. They are the Beatles. They are the dream team.

And once they get their revenge......they'll be better hunters than any of us ever dreamed of.


Scene skips to DEAN and SAM walking down the front path of VICTORS house.


DEAN

This is crazy.


SAM

Is it? They got a pretty good life.


DEAN

Kids aren't supposed to hunt, Sam.


SAM

We did.


DEAN

Yeah, and look what that did for us.


SAM

Well, maybe they're doing it right. Maybe they can hunt and have a real life.


DEAN

You know that's not true.


SAM

Why, 'cause it didn't work for us?


DEAN

Because it doesn't work for anybody.


SAM

Okay, then what do you want to do? 'Cause Victor's not gonna stop this.


DEAN

They said they were hunting a nest, right?


SAM

Yeah.


DEAN

Well, let's hunt it for 'em. Well, that way, until we can figure out what to do with Victor, they stay safe.


SAM

All right, um...So, what's your move?


DEAN

I want to talk to that girl who was tied up at the hotel. Something didn't smell right about that.

Why don't you stay here and look after the Brady Bunch?


SAM nods and turns to walk back into the house. DEAN drives off in the IMPALA and the BLUE VAN pulls up across the street with a hooded person in the driver’s seat. The camera shows the driver, who is a male, as he pulls off his hood and stares menacingly at the house.



DAYTIME

The next morning.


JOSEPHINE is sitting at the kitchen table doing homework while ADIEN and KRISSY are rushing around the dining room getting ready for school as SAM walks in and is stretching after apparently spending the night in the house and just waking up.


VICTOR

Sam, just in time. Grab a seat.


SAM

Waffles?


VICTOR

Yeah, Krissy's fave.


KRISSY

My dad used to make 'em for me all the time. I think it was the only thing he knew how to cook.


Victor removes the book from in front of JOSEPHINE.


VICTOR

Interact.


AIDAN

Yeah, nerd.


VICTORS taps at AIDEN'S elbow which is on the table. SAM sits down at the table.


VICTOR

And you -- manners.


JOSEPHINE

We're gonna be late.

VICTOR

Come on. Grab your stuff. I'll pick you up after school.


KRISSY

See ya.

The KIDS leave.

SAM

Wow.


VICTOR

Whirlwind, right?


SAM

Yeah.


VICTOR

It's always like that with kids. You got any?


VICTOR clear plates and walks into the kitchen. SAM gets up and follows him.


SAM

Me? Uh, no.


VICTOR

You want any?



SAM

Uh, I don't know.


VICTOR pulls out a wallet and starts to bring out pictures of his family.



VICTOR

Trust me, the answer's yes.


He shows the wallet with the picture of his wife and kids.


SAM

These yours?


VICTOR

Yeah. Well, until we went camping and a Wendigo ripped them to shreds.


SAM

Sorry. Is that why you're doing this, taking all these kids in?


VICTOR smiles and nods at SAM


VICTOR

But you know what I realized, Sam, is that these kids, they don't have to live it the way we have.

You know, crappy hotel rooms, always moving, no family, no life. It's not the only way.



SAME DAY

Sheriff Station

DEAN walks through the Sheriff station with the GIRL who was tied up in the hotel room.


GIRL

Like I told the cops already, I'm not sure why Jimmy Day would do something like this.


DEAN

Jimmy Day? Wait, so you knew the guy that grabbed you?


GIRL

Everyone in town knows Jimmy. He's a hero. We had a parade for him downtown when he came back

from Afghanistan.


DEAN

Uh, sorry. When was this?


GIRL

A few weeks ago.


DEAN

So, uh... this Jimmy Day guy, he -- he just grabbed you and took you to the hotel?


GIRL

No. I-I came from work and was in the parking lot when this blue van pulled up. This guy with a hoodie

asked me directions. That's all I remember, till I woke up tied to that bed.


DEAN

And was hoodie there, too?


GIRL

Just Jimmy, and he was crying, saying he was sorry and all. That he was sorry?

At first I thought he was gonna kill me. But then he just... he just seemed scared.



SAME DAY


The camera pans over pictures of VICTOR, KRISSY, JOSEPHINE and AIDEN taken in different poses and in different groups together. The camera lands on SAM picking up one of the pictures and chuckling to himself. SAM sets down the picture as he hears the front door open. He turns to the open door.


SAM

Hey. What happened to school?


KRISSY, ADIEN and JOSEPHINE walk in and KRISSY ignores SAM.


ADIEN

Victor pulled us out.


SAM

Why?


VIDCTOR walks in with a folder in his hand.


VICTOR

'Cause we've found another target.



SAM Who?


VICTOR

The vamp that killed Krissy's dad.


VICTOR looks at KRISSY concerned.


VICTOR

You ready?


KRISSY nods up at VICTOR


VICTOR

Okay.


VICTOR sets the folder on the table and opens it revealing surveillance pictures and a composite sketch of a woman.


VICTOR

Pulled this from a security camera at a nearby gas station.


SAM

Wait, how do we know this is definitely her?


VICTOR

Sheriff sketch, victim's accounts... ...and this.


VICTOR shows a surveillance photo of the woman walking into the gas station wearing a moon shaped charm on a necklace.


KRISSY

My dad's necklace. My mom gave it to him on their anniversary.


SAM

Are you sure this is a video surveillance pic?


KRISSY

It's her!


SAM'S cell phone begins to ring and he takes it out of his pocket placing the picture of the woman he picked up back on the table. He walks away to take his call in private.


SAM

Excuse me.


DEAN

Hey. You there?


SAM

Yeah. How did it go

with the girl?


DEAN

Strange. Might be that vampire wasn't lying. He was fresh made within the month, but Josephine's family was murdered three months ago.

SAM

So, who killed them, then?


DEAN

I don't know. I'd like to talk to whoever's driving that blue van. Other than that...You?


SAM

Something's up. Victor says he has a surveillance photo of the vampire that killed Krissy's father.

But, Dean...I'm not so sure.


DEAN

Why's that?


SAM There's no time stamp on it.


DEAN

Okay. So you think he's lying?


SAM

Well, that, or he's just wrong. It's hard to say.


DEAN

Yeah, I never trust a guy who wears a sweater. You want me to head back there?


SAM

No, no. I'm good. Let me do some more digging.


DEAN

All right. I'm gonna talk to the hotel clerk, see what he knows.


SAM clicks end call on his phone and as he is putting it in his pocket he notices a BLUE VAN right outside the house across the street. SAM starts to walk hurriedly back to the back of the house to the kitchen where he just left and sees that everyone but VICTOR is already gone.


SAM

Hey. Where did everybody go?


VICTOR

Tracking that vamp.


SAM

Well, I think we got a problem a lot closer to home. Look at this.


SAM gestures toward the front window as he walks back over to it and VICTOR follows him and then looks out the window.


SAM

See that blue van? My brother saw it outside the hotel yesterday. We think he's working with the vampire we popped.


VICTOR

Looks like we're going huntin'.



SAME DAY

HOTEL

FRONT DESK


DEAN walks in and over to the front desk counter to talk to the HOTEL CLERK.


HOTEL CLERK

Ahh. Nice to see you again.


DEAN starts to take money out of his wallet.


DEAN

Yeah, I bet. Listen, I need to know who, uh, checked into room 215 yesterday.


DEAN sets $60 on the counter and the HOTEL CLERK starts counting it. He shuffles through the money.


HOTEL CLERK

215. It was some guy wearing a hoodie, so it was hard to make out his face.


DEAN

He drive a blue van, by any chance?


HOTEL CLERK

Do I look like a valet?

He took one of those.


The HOTEL CLERK gestures to the mass of brochures lining the wall to his right. DEAN walks over and looks at the brochures intently.


DEAN

Which one?


HOTEL CLERK

The one that says "lodge" on it.


DEAN

"Conway Springs Lodge."


HOTEL CLERK

Yep, big during the summer season. But this time of year, it's closed.


DEAN

How far away is it from here?


HOTEL CLERK

Oh, it's a couple miles down the road.



SAME DAY

OUTSIDE VICTORS HOUSE


SAM is walking outside the BLUE VAN and looking inside the driver’s window. The BLUE VAN is empty.

SAM and VICTOR walk towards the back of the BLUE VAN and down the street to locate the driver.





SAME DAY

ON A BACK COUNTRY ROAD


DEAN is driving the IMPALA up to a camping hotel and he passes a wooden sign that reads “Conway Springs Lodge” on it. A smaller sign hangs bellow it that reads “CLOSED FOR THE SEASON”

DEAN parks the IMPALA next to the sign and cuts off the engine. DEAN gets out of the car.

DEAN looks around to see if anyone is around and then begins walking up the buildings to his front. He slides his machete out of a sheath from his left side as he walks up to a door that’s cracked open already. DEAN opens the door a little more and grabs a flashlight out of his pocket with his right hand and shines it in the doorway. He then pushes his way into the building and walks in slowly shining his flash light around showing a large stuffed bear.

DEAN continues to walk around the very large room shining his flashlight in different spots as he goes until he shines it on a girl who is sitting on the bottom of a bunk bed.


DEAN

Hey! Who the hell are you?!


It’s the same GIRL from the photo VICTOR showed SAM and the kids back at VICTOR’s house and she looks scared, weak and dirty. The GIRL shies away from the light and starts sobbing.


DEAN

Answer me!


GIRL

Please make it go away. It hurts so much.


DEAN

What? Wha...


DEAN sees a light switch on the wall and walks over and flips the lights on.


GIRL

No, shut them off! They're too bright!


DEAN

Not till you tell me what the hell's going on here.


GIRL

I don't know!


The girl suddenly has vampire teeth pop out and she brings her hands up to her face to feel them.


GIRL

Aah! What's happening to me?


DEAN

Come here.


DEAN quickly moves over to the GIRL and yanks her up off the bed and puts the machete to her neck.


DEAN

That's never happened to you before?


GIRL

No. No, there's something wrong with me. That -- that guy, he did something to me.


DEAN

What guy?


GIRL

I don't know! This guy in a blue van, he -- he grabbed me. He took me here.


The GIRL starts to bend over in pain.

GIRL

Oh, my stomach. It hurts so much.


A gun comes into view behind DEAN.


KRISSY

Dean!



DEAN turns around at the sound of his name and sees KRISSY, ADIEN and JOSEPHINE standing behind him with guns pointed at the VAMPIRE GIRL. DEAN puts up a hand to stop them and they look at DEAN angrily.



SAME DAY

IN VICTORS NEIGHBORHOOD


SAM and VICTOR walk around an area in VICTOR'S neighborhood that has trees but no houses around. SAM sees a suspicious person run in front of him and duck behind a tree. Sam motions to VICTOR to go on the other side of the tree while he goes on one side. VICTOR smiles and takes a gun from his sweater pocket. The hooded guy waits quietly. Just as SAM is about to attack the hoodie guy, VICTOR comes up behind SAM and hits him over the head with his gun. The hooded guy walks out from behind the tree and smiles at VICTOR who returns his smile. The camera looks back at the hooded guy as vampire teeth pop out while he is still smiling.



SAME DAY

CONWAY SPRINGS LODGE


DEAN

Put those away, and we can talk.


KRISSY

Why are you with the vampire that killed my dad?


DEAN

You're barking up the wrong tree. She didn't kill your pops.


KRISSY

I don't want to hurt you, Dean, but I will if you don't move.


DEAN

Listen to me, Krissy. She's innocent.


JOSEPHINE

And how would you know that?


DEAN

Because she's fresh made, a day or two. Her dad was killed months ago. This whole thing stinks. That vamp that we killed last night? Why was he swearing that he didn't do it?


ADIEN

Because he was a liar.


DEAN

Vampires don't beg for their lives. They attack. Look, last time I'm gonna ask you nicely. Take the damn guns off me, or somebody's gonna get hurt.


AIDEN

Big talk.


DEAN quickly moves and disarms AIDEN clears his gun and lets the rounded chamber fall to the floor.


DEAN

I know. It is, isn't it?


KRISSY

So, let's say this isn't the vamp who killed my dad. She's still a monster and deserves to die.


DEAN

Not if we can save her.


AIDEN

What?


DEAN

She hasn't fed yet. We can reverse this if we find her maker and get his blood.


AIDEN

And why should we care about her?


DEAN

Like I said, hunting isn't always about killing.


ADIEN

Oh, please. Preach to some other choir. We're not buying it.


DEAN

You want to kill an innocent girl?!


KRISSY

I want the blood sucker who killed my dad to pay.


DEAN

And we're gonna find out who that is. But let's not be so bloodthirsty that just anyone will do.


JOSEPHINE

But Victor says it's her.


DEAN

And I say it ain't! So we're gonna pack her to go, and we're gonna ask Victor ourselves. Okay?




NIGHTTIME

VICTORS HOUSE


SAM starts to wake up from the blow to the back of the head and he is tied to a chair in VICTOR'S living room.

VICTOR is sitting on a couch next to SAM. The HOODED VAMPIRE stands nearby.


VICTOR

You're awake. Good. We don't have much time.


SAM

For what?


VICTOR gets up and starts turning over furniture.


VICTOR

Picture this. The kids arrive home victorious, only to find you dead in their living room. It seems that nest of vampires they were hunting were seeking revenge......and killed you. Thus, inspiring them to hunt even more.

I'm sorry, Sam. I can't have anyone poisoning my kids' minds.


SAM

Other than yourself, that is.


VICTOR

I don't need to justify my actions to you or your self-righteous ass of a brother!


SAM

You mean like why you're working with a vampire? So what's he get out of this? Free roaming rights?


VICTOR

We are at war --a war that we are losing. That Leviathan fiasco was a wake-up call.

We have to do what we can to survive. But I wouldn't expect you to understand.

You're not a father. You don't know what it's like to hear the cries of your children dying.

But now I have a second chance to make it all right, to create the next generation

of hunters -- stronger, faster, smarter.


The front door opens suddenly and VICTOR pulls out his gun and points it at it.


DEAN

Hey, we're home.


The HOODED VAMPIRE smiles at the kids when they come in showing off his vamp teeth.


JOSEPHINE

What is going on here?


VICTOR

These two are not to be trusted. They're trying to destroy us.


AIDEN

Do you know this vamp, Victor?


SAM

Of course he does! They're working together!


AIDEN

Is that true?



VICTOR

It's complicated.


DEAN

No, actually, it's not. See, blue van here's been turning fresh vamps and setting them up for you kids as easy kills.


JOSEPHINE

But why?


KRISSY

Because they didn't kill our families, did they?


VICTOR

No.


JOSEPHINE

Well, then who did?


HOODED VAMP

I did. And they all screamed......and begged for mercy, especially the little ones.


VICTOR

Enough, Seth!


VICTOR still holding a gun on DEAN looks at the kids and tries to explain.


VICTOR

You have to understand. I saw a way to make the future better. But to get there, I had to do something hard.


KRISSY

He killed them off your orders?


VICTOR

You needed motivation. I scouted each and every one of you. And knew it was the only way to get you to hunt.


AIDAN

So you killed our families?


VICTOR

I know, the deaths are tragic. But think of all the future lives that will now be saved because you are now together.


KRISSY

So, these fake vampires were just a way for you to train us and fill our heads with lies?!


VICTOR

Don't you see? This is bigger than all of us. We have to learn to put things in perspective. Come with me. We can get past this.


VICTOR gently tosses his gun on the couch. KRISSY steps closer to JOSEPHINE and AIDEN and looks at them and they look at her and she shakes it “no”.


VICTOR

That is unfortunate.


VICTOR gives a side look to the SETH and SETH quickly moves over to AIDEN and grabs him. DEAN uses this time to draw a handgun from a side holster which he then points at SETH. SETH turns AIDEN to face the others and hisses at AIDEN'S ear with his teeth out fully.


KRISSY

Aiden!


VICTOR

We're leaving.


KRISSY steps in front of VICTOR to stop him.


KRISSY

That's not happening.


VICTOR

I taught you everything you know. Don't make me hurt you.


KRISSY

Not everything, Victor.


KRISSY signals JOSEPHINE who pulls out a knife and trys to stab VICTOR with it but he is able to stop her. Meanwhile KRISSY quickly pulls out a tranq gun and shoots one shot into SETH's eye and another in his chest. SETH falls over. As VICTOR turns around to face KRISSY again she's already pulling out a hand gun and pointing it at him.


DEAN

Krissy, don't.


KRISSY

If we want revenge for our families' deaths, he gives it to us!


DEAN

We don't kill people. You don't kill people.


KRISSY

He's not a person. He's a monster.


KRISSY steps towards VICTOR who backs up slowly and then falls to his knees.


SAM

Krissy, this ends bad, no matter what we do.


KRISSY is now pointing the gun directly at VICTORS head.


KRISSY

Exactly.


KRISSY cocks her gun and DEAN lowers his and takes a stop towards her.


DEAN

Krissy, don't.


KRISSY

This is for my dad.


She pulls the trigger but it only dry fires. (The gun is empty) VICTOR jumps back at the sound and gasps frantically. KRISSY continues to pull the trigger.


KRISSY

For Josephine's family.


KRISSY pulls the trigger again.


KRISSY

For Aiden.


KRISSY pulls the trigger again.


KRISSY

For me.



At each dry trigger pull VICTOR becomes more and more distraught and when KRISSY is done she drops the bullets that weren’t loaded in the gun and drops them near VICTORS head which is almost on the ground as he sobs. KRISSY turns to look at DEAN


AIDEN

So, we're just gonna let him live?


KRISSY then turns to look at AIDEN.


KRISSY

Yeah. All alone, with himself. No family. No friends. Ask me, that's not much of anything.


KRISSY turns back to DEAN


KRISSY

Let's save that girl.


While VICTOR is sobbing on his hands and knees on the floor he pulls a gun from his sock holster.


JOSEPHINE

Gun!


Before anyone can get to him, VICTOR puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger killing himself instantly.



NEXT MORNING

VICTORS HOUSE


AIDEN is sitting next to the GIRL VAMP from the LODGE on the couch in the living room. JOSEPHINE is sitting on the coffee table in front of her and KRISSY hands her a glass of the vampire cure.


JOSEPHINE

Just drink slowly.


JOSEPHINE then hands the glass to the GIRL VAMP.



JOSEPHINE

This will take away all the pain.


KRISSY then walks over to SAM and DEAN who are standing near the front door.


DEAN

Proud of you.


KRISSY

Shut up, before I punch you.


SAM

So, how's she doing?


KRISSY Better now.


SAM

Oh, um...


SAM pulls out KRISSY's dad's necklace and hands it to her.


SAM

I think this is yours.


KRISSY

Thank you.


SAM

I'll wait outside.


DEAN

Okay. Whenever you're ready, we'll be in the car.


KRISSY

What are you talking about?


DEAN

Your aunt? Cincinnati? Normal life? We'll be there by lunch tomorrow.


KRISSY

Look, I hate how we were put together, but...I can't deny that it feels right. And why should I let Victor

ruin that, too?


DEAN

So, what you're saying is that you like that boy over there and you want to stay?


KRISSY

What? Aiden? No. I mean... He's like my brother. It's nothing like that.


DEAN

Well, you're all still minors.


KRISSY

Not for long. Josephine will be 18 in a few months. And we all have a life and each other here.


DEAN

And hunting?


KRISSY

We won't go looking for it.

But if any monsters show up

around here, they better look out.


DEAN

Okay. Good.


KRISSY

Really? I thought I was gonna have to fight you way more on that.


DEAN

Well, you're right. You're not a kid anymore. You can make your own decisions.


KRISSY

You're all right for an old guy.


DEAN

I'm really not that old.


KRISSY

You keep telling yourself that.


DEAN

Huh. All right. Well, I'm gonna have a, uh --a guy come and check on you every once in a while, okay?

His name is Garth. He'll make sure that you're all right and you got what you need.


KRISSY

Garth?


DEAN

Yeah. He's a little strange at first, but you'll come to love him.


DEAN holds up a closed fist for a “pound it” but instead KRISSY grabs his fists and gets on her toes to kiss him on the cheek which makes DEAN smile.


KRISSY

Take care, Dean.


KRISSY walks off back to where JOSEPHINE and VAMP GIRL are still sitting and AIDEN stares at DEAN from down the hallway.


AIDEN

Yeah. Goodbye, Dean.


AIDEN then tries to duck back into the kitchen. But Dean calls him over.


DEAN

Aiden. Listen, there's, uh, something I want to tell you about Krissy.


AIDEN

I know. I know. You'll kill me if I ever hurt her. Blah. Blah. Blah.


DEAN

No, no. No. She'll kill you.


DEAN pats AIDEN on the back and walks out the door.


DEAN

Good luck.


AIDEN looks horrified back at KRISSY who only smiles back at him. AIDEN closes and locks the door behind DEAN.


SAM

This is good.


DEAN

Is it?


SAM

Could have been a lot worse.


DEAN

Will be if we don't shut those Gates of Hell soon.


SAM

What do they have to do with any of that?


DEAN

They're hunters now. You don't just walk away from that. There's only one way out of that,and you and I both know

it ain't pretty.


SAM

Maybe they'll be different.


DEAN

Or maybe if we shut that hell hole once and for and all, those three can have a real life.


SAM

Maybe they won't be the only ones.


SAM and DEAN get into the IMPALA and drive off down the street.
