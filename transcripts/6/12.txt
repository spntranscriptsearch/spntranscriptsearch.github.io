NOW
EXT. SKY – NIGHT and INT. TWO-SEATER PLANE – NIGHT

The small plane is being battered by bad weather. The PILOT is STAN and the PASSENGER is PENNY.

STAN
How you doing?

PENNY
I'm great. This is great.

STAN
Penny, it's gonna be okay. You know, a lot more people die in the shower.

PENNY
Good to know. Thanks.

STAN
I didn't think we'd run into any weather, though.

PENNY
Look, can we just land? Please?

STAN
Couple minutes. All right? We're close. I'm sorry.

Outside the window, Penny sees a large shape.

PENNY
What was that?!

STAN
What?

PENNY
Something just flew by the window! It was huge!

STAN
Probably just a bird, okay?

PENNY
No! No, Stan, that was not a bird.

STAN
Well, then, what was it?

PENNY
I don't know.

STAN
Penny, there's nothing out there. I promise. Hey, just close your eyes, okay? It's okay. Just lean back. Try to relax. Think of someplace nice. Waves on a beach.

PENNY
Stan?!

Something pulls STAN out of the cabin, leaving PENNY alone in the plane.

PENNY
Oh! Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no, no!

PENNY screams.

DEAN
Oh, well, don't sugarcoat it.

Guest Starring JIM BEAVER

CASTIEL
I'm sorry, Dean, but I warned you not to put that thing back inside him.

DEAN
What was I supposed to do? Let T-1000 walk around, hope he doesn't open fire?

CASTIEL
Let me tell you what his soul felt like when I touched it. Like it had been skinned alive, Dean. If you wanted to kill your brother, you should have done it outright.

DEAN looks around the basement. CASTIEL is gone. SAM is still sleeping.

DEAN
Sam?

SAM hugs DEAN.

Directed by PHIL SGRICCIA

SAM hugs BOBBY.

BOBBY
Good to see you.

SAM
Wait. I saw you—I—I felt Lucifer snap your neck.

BOBBY
Well, Cas kind of—

SAM
Cas is alive?

DEAN
Yeah, Cas—Cas is fine. Sam, are you okay?

SAM
Actually, um...I'm starving.

BOBBY'S KITCHEN
INT. BOBBY'S KITCHEN – DAY

SAM is eating a sandwich. He is sitting at a table with DEAN; they both have beers in front of them. BOBBY is leaning against the counter.

DEAN
So, Sam...

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
What's the last thing you remember?

Flashbacks to 5.22 Swan Song.

SAM
The field. And then I fell.

DEAN
Okay. And then?

SAM
I woke up in the panic room.

BOBBY
That's it? You really don't remember—

DEAN
Let's be glad. Who wants to remember all that hell?

SAM
Well, how long was I gone?

DEAN
About a year and a half.

SAM
What? I was downstairs f— I don't remember anything. So, how'd I get back? Was it Cas?

DEAN
Not exactly.

SAM
Dean, what did you do?

DEAN
Me and Death—

SAM
Death?! The horseman?

DEAN
I had leverage. It's done.

SAM
You sure?

DEAN
It's over. Slate's wiped.

BOBBY
Well, isn't this just neat and clean?

DEAN
Yes, it is—for once.

SAM
Is there anything else I should know?

DEAN hesitates.

DEAN
No. Another beer?

SAM
Uh, yeah.

DEAN gets up.

BOBBY'S YARD
EXT. BOBBY'S YARD – DAY

BOBBY is under a car, doing something with a wrench.

DEAN
Hey.

DEAN holds up two beers.

BOBBY
How is he?

DEAN
He's, uh...He's good. Really good. Better than I could have hoped.

DEAN puts down one beer on the work bench and sits down, opening the other beer.

BOBBY
Uh-huh.

DEAN
What? Why the poopface?

DEAN takes a drink. BOBBY comes over.

BOBBY
I'm glad he's better. I really am. But... That kid went straight-up Menendez on me not ten days ago. And now it's all just...erased? Sorry. I'm having a bit of a hard time even looking at him.

DEAN
It wasn't Sam.

BOBBY
Well, maybe it wasn't all Sam, but it was him, Dean.

DEAN
Well, what do you want to do, Bobby? We tell him everything?

BOBBY
No. Just wish I could, that's all.

DEAN
Yeah, but if we start throwing that crap at him, we don't know what's gonna happen. It could—it could crack the wall.

BOBBY
I know. I know.

DEAN
So, you know what? As far as I'm concerned, it's a gift horse, and I'm not looking for teeth. I'm sending Death a damn fruit basket.

BOBBY
He's gonna find out, you know. One way or another, someone'll tell him, or he'll figure it out on his own. He's not dumb. He should it hear it from us.

DEAN
Can we just leave it alone for the moment, please?

BOBBY puts up his hands and goes back to work with the wrench.

BOBBY
Okay. But you better prep for the B side, 'cause when Sam realizes we're shining him, it ain't gonna be cute.
DEAN takes another drink.

BOBBY'S YARD AGAIN
EXT. CAR GRAVEYARD – DAY

DEAN closes the trunk of the Impala. BOBBY opens the front passenger door.

BOBBY
Sam still asleep?

DEAN
Yeah, let him rest. We'll call him later.

SAM
Call me from where?

SAM has just shown up.

DEAN
Oh. Uh, there's this thing in Oregon.

SAM
Great. I'm in.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa. You just got vertical.

SAM
Exactly. I'm up. I'm good.

DEAN
Well, a few more days of crap cable couldn't hurt.

SAM
Right. Because that's what you did when you got back from hell.

DEAN
All right. You, me, and Bobby.

BOBBY
Oh, you two go on ahead. You got this covered. I, uh, forgot I promised that idjit Rufus I'd work the phones for him, so...

DEAN
You sure?

BOBBY
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You two enjoy catching up, okay?

BOBBY leaves.

SAM
What was that?

DEAN
One part age, three parts liquor.

DEAN and SAM head to their respective doors.

EXT. IMPALA – NIGHT

INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

Jethro Tull's "A New Day Yesterday" plays.

SAM is on the phone.

SAM
Uh, you got it, officer. Thank you. You too.

SAM hangs up the phone.

SAM
So, get this—besides the crash, there were two other disappearances in town this week.

DEAN
Really?

SAM
Yeah, last weekend, a college girl vanished from her apartment. On the seventeenth floor. Then, three days ago, another girl didn't make it home from school.

DEAN
They know each other?

SAM
No. No connection. Just young and female, like the plane-crash girl.

DEAN
What would disappear a girl out of the sky, anyway?

SAM
Good question.

SAM waits a moment.

SAM
So you never even tried, huh?

DEAN
Tried?

SAM
To go live a life...after. You do remember you promised that, right?

DEAN
Yeah, I remember.

SAM
So, why didn't you try?

DEAN
What makes you think I didn't?

SAM
'Cause look at you. Look at this. You're exactly the same.

DEAN
Yeah, you're probably right.

A long pause.

DEAN
I was with them for a year—Lisa and Ben.

SAM
A year?

DEAN nods.

SAM
So then what?

DEAN
Didn't work out.

DEAN turns up the music.

MUSIC
It was a new day yesterday but it's an old day now

They pass a sign that says PORTLAND 20.

DESSERTINES' HOUSE
EXT. DESSERTINES' HOUSE – DAY

DEAN
You're, uh...Penny Dessertine's sister, right?

PENNY'S SISTER
Mm-hmm.

SAM
Uh, we'd just like to ask you a few questions.

PENNY'S SISTER
Look, the cops already came by. I'm tired. So, if you don't mind --

SAM
I—I understand. Really, I do. I know how hard this must be. We'd just like to figure out what happened. This will be quick. I promise.

PENNY'S SISTER
Okay. Fine. Come in.

INT. PENNY'S HOUSE – DAY

PENNY'S SISTER
Penny was very shy. To herself. Not at all what you'd call adventurous.

DEAN
What, like flying through a lightning storm in a two-seater?

PENNY'S SISTER
She was terrified of that thing. She just did it for Stan.

SAM
Stan?

PENNY'S SISTER
They were just starting to get serious. She didn't want to seem, you know...Not interested. I just wish I'd told her to stay home. We don't even have a body to bury.

MOTEL ROOM
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

SAM
Hey.

DEAN
What do you got?

SAM
Uh...Well, looks like those other two missing girls both baked cookies for the lord.

DEAN
What is that? Code?

SAM
No. Church choir, bake sales, promise-ring clubs—the works. They were good girls. But Penny wasn't even a Christian, so—

DEAN
I have another theory. Penny's diary.

SAM
Did you steal that from her room?

DEAN
I love that you even asked me that.

SAM
And why wouldn't I?

DEAN
No reason. So girl-nappings. What if it's not about religion, what if it's about purity?

SAM
You mean you think they're all—

DEAN
Virgins, Sam. Virgins.

SAM
Penny was twenty-two.

DEAN
Yeah, with a pink room.

SAM
So?

DEAN
And stuffed teddy bears.

SAM
Fine. But you really think—

DEAN reads from PENNY's diary.

DEAN
"I've decided I'm going to give Stan my most precious gift."

SAM
Wow. That sounded really creepy coming out of your mouth.

DEAN
I think I delivered it.

SAM
You know, you—you could have led with 'the diary'. You know? Anyways, let's say you're right. Fine. Who would want virgins?

DEAN
You got me. I prefer ladies with experience.

ST. MARY'S
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF ST. MARY'S CENTER FOR CATHOLIC STUDIES – NIGHT

MELISSA and two other young women are walking together. MELISSA goes in a different direction. SOMETHING swoops down from the sky and attacks her.

MELISSA
Aaaaaaaah!

ACT TWO
HOSPITAL ROOM
INT. HOSPITAL – DAY'

MELISSA
It happened so fast.

SAM
It's all right, Melissa. What came at you? You can tell us.

MELISSA
It—it looked like a...a giant bat. You think I'm making it up, right? That's what the other man said.

SAM
Well, I'm not the other man.

MELISSA
It came right at me. It was huge. I swear. That's how I got this.

MELISSA pulls her gown forward to reveal large gashes on her back.

SAM
So, it attacked. And then what happened?

MELISSA
I don't know. I passed out, and when I woke up, it was gone.

SAM
Is there anything else you can think of? Anything you can tell us, even if it doesn't seem important?

MELISSA
Well, my ring got lost. Or else that thing stole it, if that makes any sense.

DEAN
What kind of ring?

MELISSA
Gold. Promise ring.

DEAN
Promise ring. So, uh...from, like, a church? Like
like a purity ring?

MELISSA
Yeah. Why?

DEAN
I got to ask. Uh, Melissa... Look, nobody is, uh, judging anybody here, okay? Believe me. But...Should you really be wearing that ring?

MELISSA
Well, I-I mean, I-I am—

DEAN
Really?

MELISSA
Matt Barne didn't count!

PARKING LOT
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT – DAY

SAM
So, what, you think Batman tried to rape her?

DEAN
Well, he does carry a lot of rage. But he rejected her because she was already dehymenated, huh?

SAM
You think?

DEAN
I think it just goes to show that being easy's pretty much all upside.

SAM
So, what kind of thing likes virgins and gold?

DEAN
P. Diddy?

SAM
You know, it's comforting.

DEAN
What's that?

SAM
I died for a year, came back, and you're still not funny.

DEAN
Shut up. I'm hilarious.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

SAM
This can't be possible.

DEAN
Try me.

SAM
Um, I googled "fire," "claws," "flying," "stealing virgins," and "gold," and it all takes me to the same place.

DEAN
Where?

SAM
World of Warcraft fansites.

DEAN
I don't know what that means.

SAM
Dragons, dude. See? Told you. Not possible.

DEAN
Actually, it might be.

SAM
How? In what reality?

DEAN
It's been a strange year. We should get a second opinion.

INT. BOBBY'S KITCHEN – DAY and INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY, alternating

BOBBY is cooking. The phone rings. He answers.

BOBBY
Yeah?

DEAN
What do you know about dragons?

BOBBY
What? Nothing.

DEAN
Seriously.

BOBBY
Well, they're not like the Loch Ness monster, Dean. Dragons aren't real.

DEAN
Could you make a few calls?

BOBBY
To who? Hogwarts?

DEAN
Humor me.

BOBBY
Fine.

DEAN
You're a gentleman and a scholar.

BOBBY
Yeah, yeah. Hey, how's Memento doing over there? He caught you in any lies yet?

DEAN
Everything's fine. Sam says hey.

DEAN hangs up.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

SAM
You okay?

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
Bobby say anything?

DEAN
Nope.

SAM is flipping through JOHN's journal.

DEAN
Dad never wrote anything about dragons. I promise. I'd remember if I read The Neverending Story in there.

SAM
Hey, did we hunt a skinwalker lately?

DEAN
Doesn't ring a bell. Why?

SAM
I don't know. Just...déjà vu or something. Are you sure? I could have sworn—

DEAN
You got to remember, your eggs are still a little scrambled, right? But, yeah, I'm sure.

SAM
All right. Yeah. Never mind.

DEAN's phone rings. He answers.

DEAN
Hey, Bobby. What do you got?

BOBBY
Can't believe she didn't jump right to mind. Dr. Visyak. Medieval Studies, S.F.U.

DEAN
Dr. Visyak, S.F.U. Got it. Thanks. All right. I'm going to San Francisco, figure out how to kill these things. You figure out where they are.

SAM
W-wait. D-did Bobby say where they like to park?

DEAN
No.

SAM
Great. Back to the lore.

DEAN
Which says what? That they live in Middle-Earth?

SAM
No. Caves.

Bobby Singer sent me. Hello? Hi.

The door opens and DR. VISYAK comes out.

INT. DR. VISYAK'S HOUSE – DAY

DR. VISYAK
Bobby Singer. Tell him something for me next time you see him.

DEAN
Hmm?

DR. VISYAK
Actually, just kick him in the jewels. That's more poetic.

DEAN
No love lost between you two, huh?

DR. VISYAK
No. Just the opposite.

DEAN
Oh?

DR. VISYAK
That's his story to tell. He's the idiot. So, what's this about?

DEAN
Well, uh...Dragons.

DR. VISYAK
Really?

DEAN
What, no twelve-sided-dice joke?

DR. VISYAK
We can joke about them because they've disappeared. But they aren't funny.At all.

DEAN
Well, one just flew in stateside.

DR. VISYAK
Are you sure?

DEAN
Fits the lore to a tee.

DR. VISYAK
But how? I mean, why? It's been seven hundred years.

DEAN
Banner crop of crazy all the way around these days, doc.

DR. VISYAK
So you want to know how to kill it.

DEAN
That's right.

DR. VISYAK
Well, you need a blade.

DEAN
Uh... Okay. What kind of blade?

DR. VISYAK
One forged with dragon's blood.

DEAN
So you need one to kill one, but you got to kill one to make one. How does that work out?

DR. VISYAK
Well, there aren't many dragon swords around anymore. Five or six, tops, worldwide. I mean, there's the sword of St. George, and, of course, there's Excalibur. And there's—

DEAN
You know a lot about this stuff, don't you?

DR. VISYAK
Well, I sure as hell better. I have one in the basement.

DEAN
You have one.

DR. VISYAK
Finding it took two decades, countless hours, and some really bad sex with an eastern European ambassador, but, yeah.

DR. VISYAK opens a door to a room containing a sword embedded in a boulder.

DEAN
That is not real. Is that real? Is it Excalibur?

DR. VISYAK
No. This...Is the Sword of Brunswick. Love of my life.

DEAN
So, uh, what's with the cement shoe?

DR. VISYAK
You know, binding sword to stone used to be all the rage. To protect them.

DEAN
All right, well, how do we get this puppy out?

DR. VISYAK laughs.

DR. VISYAK
Well, come on. You know this one. We need a brave knight who's willing to step up and kill the beast.

DEAN
Right. All right, well, I'll, uh, give it a whirl. Do you mind?

DR. VISYAK
Oh.

DEAN goes to pull the sword out of the stone, but is unable to and falls.

DR. VISYAK
You okay?

DEAN
Never better.

DEAN tries again but fails.

DEAN
Oh, son of a bitch! That's really on there!

DR. VISYAK
Yeah, afraid so.

DEAN
Well, I have another idea.

DR. VISYAK
What?

DEAN
Well, you're not gonna like it.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

SAM calls BOBBY.

BOBBY
Sam. Where's Dean?

SAM
Hey, um...He went to go see your friend. So, look, I'm trying to figure out where this thing lairs up. Uh, little help, maybe?

BOBBY
What are the parameters?

SAM
Caves, basically. But there's nothing around for miles.

BOBBY
So, less literal, then. What else you got local that's cold, dark, and wet?

SAM
Huh. Well, um...There's no subway lines. Sewers. That could be it. Thanks.

BOBBY
All right.

SAM
Wait, Bobby. Wait. Um...You okay?

BOBBY
Yeah, of course. Why? What's wrong?

SAM
Besides the way you been acting and talking? Nothing. Is there something I should know?

BOBBY
No. All you need to know is where Godzilla's holed up.

SAM
Well, Bobby, what happened this last year?

BOBBY
It had its moments. No more than usual. It's got nothing to do with you, Sam. How could it?

SAM
Right. 'Course.

BOBBY
Call me if you need anything.

SAM Ye—

BOBBY hangs up. SAM sighs and closes his eyes.

SAM
Castiel, um...I'm back. So, if you got a minute...

CASTIEL
Sam. It's so good to see you alive.

SAM
Yeah. You too.

CASTIEL walks over to SAM, arms out in an attempt to hug SAM, but SAM sits down instead.

SAM

Um...Look, I-I would hug you, but—

CASTIEL
—that would be awkward.

SAM
Um...Was a crazy year, huh? I-I-I just talked to Bobby. He—he told me everything that happened.

CASTIEL
Frankly, I'm surprised that you survived. I was begging Dean not to do it.

SAM
Yeah. No, I-I-I can understand that.

CASTIEL
You know, it's a miracle it didn't kill you.

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, it's a miracle, all right.

CASTIEL
So, how does it feel?

SAM
What?

CASTIEL
Well, to have your soul back, of course.

SAM
Right. Y-you mean 'cause I was walking around with no soul. Uh... Really good, Cas. I'm real good. You know what? I'm—I'm just hazy on a few of the details, though. Um... You think maybe you could...walk me through?

DR. VISYAK'S BASEMENT
INT. DR. VISYAK'S BASEMENT – DAY

DR. VISYAK
You know what? I-I-I don't like this at all. You do realize that this is the single most valuable artifact you have ever touched.

DEAN
It's also the only weapon we got. Look, I know what I'm doing, okay? I actually learned it all from Bobby. Hey, whatever happened there, you know he's at least a genius at this. Do you want me to kill that dragon or not?

DR. VISYAK
Okay.

DEAN
Trust me.

DEAN kneels next to the rock and places C4 on it.

DEAN
You rocks think you're so smart. All right. Welcome to the 21st century. All right, stand back.

DEAN and DR. VISYAK exit the room. DEAN detonates the charges.

DEAN
Okay. Now...

DEAN pulls out the sword, which has broken in half.

DEAN
You've got insurance for this, right?

And what are we supposed to do with this, Dean? Give it a booster shot?

DEAN
It's what we got. All right? We're just gonna have to get a little closer. That's all. Where are we on the caves?

SAM
Nowhere. Sewers, on the other hand...Here. Check this out.

SAM points at their map.

SAM
So, two of the disappearances happened within a mile of here. So I think we start there and work our way around.

DEAN
Awesome. Who doesn't love sewers? Let's go.

SAM looks like he is about to say something.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Nothing. Uh, yeah, let's go.

SEWER
INT. SEWERS

DEAN
Ugh! God. Just when I get used to a smell, I hit a new flavor. Dude, we have been here for hours. There is nothing. I think the lore is off. Hey, what if, uh...What if dragons like nice hotels?

SAM
What is that?

SAM shines his flashlight at something behind DEAN.

DEAN
What?

DEAN also shines his flashlight and they see that what they are looking at is a pile of gold.

DEAN
Holy crap.

DEAN picks up a gold watch from the pile.

DEAN
Okay, maybe there are dragons here.

DEAN starts to take some of the gold.

SAM
Wait. Dean...Not now. Check this out.

SAM walks off towards an altar he has found. There is a leather-bound book on the altar.

SAM
A little arts-and-crafty for a giant bat, right?

PENNY
Hello? Is someone there? Hello?

SAM and DEAN find the girls trapped under the grates of the sewer.

DEAN
Hey. We're gonna get you out.

PENNY
Quick. He's coming back.

SAM is pulled backwards by a DRAGON. DEAN takes out the dragon sword.

DRAGON
Where do you think you're gonna stick that?

DEAN cuts into the DRAGON's arm.

DRAGON
Aah! Where did you get that?

DEAN
Comic-Con.

The DRAGON knocks the sword out of DEAN's hand. The sword falls between the grates. The DRAGON approaches DEAN, his hand glowing brightly. SAM distracts him. DEAN grabs at the sword, which is just out of reach.

DEAN Come on, come on.

DEAN is grabbed by another DRAGON. SAM kicks away the dragon he has been fighting.

DRAGON
Aah!

SAM reaches down and grabs the sword from between the grates. He stabs the dragon fighting DEAN. The other DRAGON escapes.

Hey, Sam. Ask me what time it is.

SAM
Why don't you cut to the chase and just roll in it?

DEAN
I rarely have wealth.

SAM
Dean...

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
I am so...so sorry. I can't even begin to say.

DEAN
For what?

SAM
You know what.

DEAN
Did Bobby...

SAM
Cas.

DEAN
Cas. Friggin' child.

SAM
You should have told me, Dean.

DEAN
You weren't supposed to know.

SAM
What I did? To Bobby? To you? Of course I should know.

DEAN
Sam, Death didn't just shove your soul back in, okay? He put up the great wall of Sam between you and the things that you don't remember. And trust me when I say that the things you don't know could kill you. That's not a joke.

SAM
All right. But I have to set things right. Or what I can, anyway.

DEAN
It wasn't you.

SAM
You know, I kind of feel like I got slipped the worst mickey of all time...and I woke up to find out that I had burnt the whole city down. And you can say it wasn't me, but...I'm the one with the zippo in my pocket, you know? So I'm not sure it's that cut and dry. And, look, I a-appreciate you trying to protect me. I really do. But I got to fix... What I got to fix. So I need to know what I did.

But you don't know how dangerous that could be.

What would you do? Right. Same thing.

Now, as near as I can figure it, this dates back around the fourteenth century.

SAM
What language is it?

BOBBY
Da Vinci code. Real obscure Latinate. Gonna take me my golden years to translate it all. Oh, and, uh, FYI—that ain't paper.

DEAN
What is it?

BOBBY
It's human skin. Okay. I'm fairly clear on this first bit. It basically describes this place. It's like the backside of your worst nightmares. It's all blood and bone and darkness.

Filled with the bodies and souls of all things hungry, sharp, and nasty.

DRAGON 2
Where are they?

DRAGON 1
I ran into trouble.

DRAGON 2
You're damn lucky I got enough.

DRAGON 1 grabs one of the girls from the van.

DRAGON 1
This is your lucky day, little girl. Come on, come on.

SAM
Monsters?

BOBBY
It's monsterland. According to this, it goes by many names, most of which I can't pronounce, but I'm thinking you know Purgatory.

DEAN
Purgatory? Awesome. Well, that is good to know. So, you're saying that these, uh, dragon freaks were squatting in the sewers and reading tone poems about purgatory?

BOBBY
Oh, no, no, no. They're reading an instruction manual.

DEAN
What?

BOBBY
Yeah. If you're nuts enough to want access to a place that gnarly, this book will show you how to open a door.

DEAN
Door to purgatory. Well, I know a demon who would have loved to have known about that. So, how do you open the door?

BOBBY
Ask Cloverfield. I'm pretty sure he's got that page.

DRAGON 1
Ego coniuro vos, insolubiliter ad mei potenciam aligati! Ad me...Sine prestolacione venire...

GIRL
Let me go! Please stop!

DRAGON 1
...Debeatis aperiat!

GIRL
No! Please don't!

DRAGON It'll go easier if you relax.

The DRAGONS throw the girl into the fiery pit below.

DRAGON
Huc sine mora debeas mater!

BOBBY
It gets worse.

SAM
Worse?

BOBBY
This ain't talking about how to take a vacation over there. This is all about opening a door to let something in.

SAM
Bring something here. What?

BOBBY
I'm working on it.

DEAN
Could you give us something?

BOBBY
I got a name.

DEAN
Okay.

BOBBY
Mother.

SAM
Mother? M-mother of what? Mother of dragons?

BOBBY
I wish. It says it a few times here. Mother of all.

The girl the dragons threw into the pit, rises back up, her eyes glowing red, and her legs burning like embers.

DRAGON 1
Welcome.

MOTHER OF ALL
You kept me waiting.

DEAN
What the hell does "mother of all" mean?

BOBBY
I don't know.

MOTHER OF ALL
We have so much to do. Let's get started.
