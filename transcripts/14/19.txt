== ACT ONE==< NOW

Dean: We know it wasn't easy for some of you to get here, and we thank you. We, uh -- We gave her a Hunter's send-off a few days ago. But we know that her family went beyond just us. Some of you hunted alongside her. Some of you fought Michael with her in the other world. You know, we lost our mom once before. But we got a second chance with her. And we got to know her not just as "Mom," but as someone who was tough and strong. Stubborn as Hell. Someone who had opinions and wasn't shy to use them. She could handle a machete. She could handle a vampire. She could handle our old man. She couldn't cook worth a damn. Mom, you weren't here long enough. But we're so glad for the time that we had. Goodbye, Mom.

Sam: Bye, Mom.

All: To Mary. (Suddenly a hatchet went sailing into the air, killing a guy instantly and shocking the hunters as Bobby appears, though it turns out it was a wraith he had killed.)

Bobby: Make sure I get my hatchet back. Damn wraith. Knew him from a nest your mom and I busted up on our last Hunt. Probably here to gloat. The bastard.

Sam: Thanks for coming out.

Castiel: A Hunter's memorial, complete with monster. Mary would have appreciated that.

Bobby: Now that you mention it, yeah. How are you?

Sam: Hey, you know. It's tough.

Bobby: And the other one? Yeah, Dean seems to be doing okay.

Sam: Hard to say.

Bobby: Yeah. Maybe he's like me. Bein' teary in public's not my style.

Sam: Hey. Uh, most everybody's headed out, but Bobby's gonna stick around. I thought maybe we could open that scotch Ketch left and hang out, talk about Mom.

Dean: "Talk about Mom"?

Sam: Yeah.

Dean: Isn't that what we've been doing?

Bobby: Thanks. Memory lane?

Sam: Yeah. I mean, Dean couldn't have been but 4 years old. I wasn't even 6 months.

Bobby: You know, at one time, you boys were good-lookin'.

Sam: Thanks.

Bobby: Sam. What exactly happened to her? Because I'm hearin' the kid -

Sam: Hey.

Dean: Hey.

Castiel: You need anything?

Dean: Yeah, I need a drink.

Bobby: Bar's open.

Dean: Nah, I need to get outta here for a while.

Sam: But, dude, we got to talk about Jack.

Dean: We will.

Bobby: About that. I liked the kid. We fought together. But there's only one way this ends.

Castiel: Bobby's right. We have to find Jack and help him.

Bobby: What? That kid -- he killed Mary!

Castiel: I know that.

Bobby: Ah-ah. Don't say "but.

Castiel: But he -- Jack may not even realize what he did was wrong.

Bobby: If his human side is gone, you know what's left -- Lucifer. Now, if you boys want to sit around and talk, fine. But me? I'm gonna get on the horn to some of my people and go find that boy.

Castiel: And what then?

Bobby: An unstoppable monster who don't know right from wrong gets put down -- or the closest we can get to it. And anybody who don't know that needs to go back to school.

Mary: Take me home, Jack.

Jack: Tell me it's okay.

Mary: If Sam and Dean saw what you did they would be as worried as I am.

Jack: Are you gonna tell them? - Leave me alone!

Mary: Please! - Listen! Jack?

Jack: Leave me alone.

Mary: Listen to me!

Jack: Leave me alone! I wish you were here. Mom, I need you to tell me what to do.

Nick: Well, next best thing.

Jack: You're just in my head. I'm making you up.

Nick: Or you see me because you know I tell you the truth.

Jack: No.

Nick: Hmm. And, by the way, buddy. Um, I'm real. You're part of my DNA. I'm locked in your head and your heart forever.

Jack: I'm not listening to you.

Nick: So what are you gonna do? You just gonna pine away for Mommy and the Winchesters? Only they -- they never loved you. You're nothing to them. You're just their -- You're just a little pet monster. Their -- Their muscle.

Jack: No, they -- They'll understand about what happened.

Nick: Are you out of your mind?

Jack: I'll explain it to them. It -- It was an accident. And I tried to bring her back, and they've made mistakes, too.

Nick: Okay. Dude, they hate you. Okay? They don't even want you for a pet anymore. From here on out, you're all you got. Well, and me. Especially me.

(Scene goes to somewhere in the woods it's misting rain and the Impala found parked. Dean was sitting outside crying.)

== ACT TWO==

Dumah: Castiel. What a pleasant surprise.

Castiel: It's urgent that I see Naomi.

Dumah: And, like I told you before, she is unavailable.

Castiel: What does that mean? Just tell me.

Dumah: It means the Empty invaded. Under her watch. We almost died. Under her watch. Heaven needs a leader.

Castiel: A leader like you?

Dumah: Oh, I'm not my first choice, either, but here we are.

Castiel: A-And Naomi, she's?

Dumah: In a very small cell. Not that you should care. She wasn't your biggest fan.

Castiel: No, but I needed her help.

Dumah: With?

Castiel: To find an archangel.

Dumah: Really? I mean, 'cause, after Michael, there's -- there's none of those left.

Castiel: This isn't exactly a -- It's the Nephilim.

Dumah: Lucifer's love child.

Castie: Jack has grown massively powerful. Dangerously so.

Dumah: And I thought that it was his "mother's side" that was supposed to give him self-control.

Castiel: Well, in the sense that he inherited her decency, yes. But that was before.

Dumah: Before what?

Castiel: Before he burned through his soul. To save me. Among others.

Duham: So he lost his capacity for good through an act of goodness. (She gives an odd grin which made Cas wonder a bit) What about the Winchesters?

Castiel: Jack's no longer with them. He's on the run. He's fearful of their fury.

Dumah: I bet he is.

Castiel: But I am hopeful that he can be salvaged. He can be rehabilitated, with patient molding and guidance.

Dumah: I'll see what I can do.

Sam: Hey. You just getting back? Yeah. How you feeling?

Dean: What you working on? I, uh -- I'm trying to find Jack. We got to find him before Bobby and his crew, 'cause if they find him first --

Dean: He's gonna kill 'em all?

Sam: I don't know. You know, I can't stop thinking about Mom.

Dean: Yeah.

Sam: I-I can't stop thinking that most people, it's -- it's -- it's -- it's hope and faith, right? That's all they have. But we know the truth. We know God is real. We know angels are real, too.

Dean: God writes paperback books in his underwear, okay? And angels are dicks.

Sam: But they're real, right? We know that Mom's not sitting on a cloud playing a harp. She's in a good place. Or she's in a great place. She's with Dad.

Dean: Hmm. You know what else? There wasn't enough left of her to even try to bring her back.

Dumah: Hello, Jack. Remember me?

Jack: We met -- in Heaven.

Dumah: Yes, we did.

Jack: How did you find me?

Dumah: Jack, I came here to tell you something. Something important. It wasn't your fault. What happened with Mary Winchester.

Jack: You know about that?

Dumah: Jack, it was a mistake. That doesn't mean that you don't deserve redemption. I know Heaven knows your mother knew that you have a glorious destiny.

Jack: I do?

Dumah: Look at the world around you, Jack. You know, there was a time when Earth had moral order. When God would punish those who did wrong and who didn't respect Heaven. But when he left, it all fell apart. You could change that. You couldn't save Mary Winchester, but you can save so many others, even Heaven itself. You could make the world so much better. And think how happy that would make Sam and Dean.

Jack: Dr. Tate.

Dr. Tate: You've come about the leak in my bathroom?

Dumah: Hardly.

Dr. Tate: I'm sorry. Who are you?

Dumah: "Fake News: Biblical Lies. " Quite the best seller, I believe.

Dr. Tate: People are hungry for the truth.

Dumah: And your call to reject God and Heaven -- that is the "truth"?

Dr. Tate: It's an attempt to replace wishful thinking with rational thought.

Dumah: In more civilized times, that was called heresy. And those ideas were an affront to Heaven.

Dr. Tate: If there were a Heaven.

Jack: Oh, there is. I've been there.

Dr. Tate: I see. And I suppose you saw God?

Jack: No. But he is my grandfather.

Dr. Tate: Huh. So then that would make your father--

Jack: Lucifer.

Dumah: Professor Tate, Heaven is not unreasonable. You can avoid divine retribution by announcing to your considerable audience that you've had a revelation that everything you've written to date is false that God is good.

Dr. Tate: Yeah. You're insane. And I would rather call security. (When Dr. Tate stands Jack uses his powers and turns him into a brick of salt.)

== ACT THREE==

Sam: So, the angels -- they're gonna help us?

Castirl: I was promised every effort would be made to, uh, locate Jack.

Dean: Oh. Heaven promised? Great. Well, we should take that to the bank.

Castiel: Jack's powers could also be a threat. It serves them to help find him.

Sam: Yeah, about that. Um, I've been looking for anything weird. And a university professor was found dead in his office in Ohio. His body was crystallized into a block of salt.

Dean: Salt. Why's that sound familiar?

Castiel: It's a pillar of salt. It's Biblical. Lot's wife. Punished by Heaven.

Dean: This guy was an atheist.

Sam: He wrote a bunch of best-selling books trying to disprove God and Heaven.

Dean: Okay. So you think an angel iced him?

Castiel: No ordinary angel could do something like that.

Sam: Just wait. There's another. A few hours after the professor was killed, a lady in Texas fell into a crevice that opened up, and she was killed.

Dean: Like a sinkhole.

Sam: That's what I thought, too. But a witness said it was more like "a fissure opened under her feet then closed back up with her inside."

Castiel: "And the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all of the men that appertained unto Korah." It's Numbers 26:10.

Sam: This lady was a -- a TV evangelist. Um, she was under investigation for stealing thousands of dollars through fake charities.

Dean: So either Chuck came back, which -- That ain't gonna happen, or J--

Castiel: Jack.

Dumah: You've done excellent work, Jack. When God was in his prime, Heaven was in its glory. Working as a team, we can bring that back.

Jack: Sam and Dean will like that?

Dumah: Words can't begin to express how Sam and Dean will feel. Now here is the real test. We need more angels. You're not God. You can't just make them out of thin air. But if a human were predisposed to it, maybe you could take their soul and forge them into one of us. What do you say? This is where your grandfather received prayers. Make yourself still. And available. Focus. You'll hear.

Woman: Dear God, please help.

Man: Please, God, let the Giants win the World Series.

Shelley: Please, God. we beseech you to hear our prayer. We humbly ask that you receive our gratitude for your gifts and pray that you deliver us unto Heaven and the greater glory. Amen!

All: Amen! Okay.

Shelley: I sure hope everyone did the reading last week. Uh-huh. Yes. Small surprise -- Pastor Ames is coming by to discuss the Book of Samuel. Oh! Sorry. I-I didn't see you come in. Please. Join us. Take a seat, mister?

Jack: Jack. My name is Jack. Did you mean it when you said you wanted to go to Heaven? -

Shelly: Yes. Yes. That's the goal of everyone in this room.

Man: Mm-hmm.

Jack: And you don't mind becoming angels?

Shelly: Mind?

Man: Yeah! T

Shelley: That would be a dream.

Jack: It doesn't have to be a dream.

Shelly: I-I'm not sure I understand. (When Jack used the lightening and his powers making himself glow and the wings spread out it shocks the room) Ohh! Who are you?

Jack: Come with me. To Heaven.

Ames: So, who's ready to take on the Book of Samuel? Hello.

Jack: I was just taking your friends -- to become angels.

Ames: You -- What?

Jack: Would you like to join them?

Ames: Son. This isn't funny. It's not even possible.

Jack: So you're saying you don't believe?

Ames: It's not that I don't believe. I just don't believe you. And -- Shelley?

Jack: Sir, please don't interfere with Heaven's work.

Amen All right. Get out! [ Thud ]

Jack: "He was eaten by worms and breathed his last.

Deam: Pastor Ames? Hi. Agent Kilmister. Clarke and Taylor. FBI. We want to ask you about last night. What happened to your congregation?

Ames: You want to know w-- They're all -- They're gone. They're all gone.

Sam: We're trying to figure out exactly what happened.

Ames You're just gonna think I'm crazy. The cops did.

Sam: About that, uh, the police report stated that you said the group "disappeared" right in front of you.

Ames: Yeah.

Sam: Did he say where he was taking them?

Ames: To Heaven. To become angels.

Sam; Did he look anything like this? That's him.

Ames: I tried to stop him, but --

Dean: And he did all this to you?


Ames: He just waved his hand, and I landed on the floor, and these cuts opened up all over my body. And worms crawled out of 'em. Worms!

Sam: Worms.

Ames: He said he was carrying out Heaven's orders and that I wasn't a believer.

Dean: Well, feel better. Yeah.

Castiel: Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.

Sam: Wait. So this is another Bible thing?

Dean: What the Hell is going on? (We end up back at the bunker where Dean was walking with Sam to a room looks like he had mad a decision) I didn't want it to come to this, either. But I know that that kid's head's not right. And now that Heaven has its hooks in him, we don't have a choice.

Sam: Wait. Come to what? What are you talking about?

Dean: Stopping Jack. Once and for all.

Sam: All right. Fine. Say I agree. Dean, he can't be killed.

Dean: No, but he can be contained.

Sam: How are we supposed to do that?

Dean: With this.

Sam: Are we seriously talking about locking Jack in this?

Dean: No, we're seriously talking about not having a choice. We can't kill him, okay? And this is warded to lock down an archangel.

Sam: Yeah. So -- So, what? We -- We just force him inside?

Dean: Maybe. But he might. He might if he only has to stay in there long enough for us to finish the spell to fix his soul.

Sam: Spell? What spell? There is no spell.

Dean: We know that.

Sam: So you want to lie to him.

Dean: No. Well, I mean, I want Zeppelin to get back together. But what I need -- What we need is to stop Jack. Big difference. But here's the deal. We both got to sign off on it. This might be our only shot, and if he even catches a whiff that this is a scam, he's off into the wind.

Sam: Exactly. And how do you think he's not gonna know something's up?

Dean: Because you're gonna be so damn sincere.

Sam: Me?

Dean: Mm-hmm.

Sam: Why me?

Dean: Because you've always been in his corner, all right? You're his go-to guy. Sam, if you reach out, he'll come. If I do it, after what happened to Mom, I could lose it. I will lose it.

== ACT FOUR==

Castiel: Eremiel, open the portal.

Eremiel: No can do, my brother. Heaven is now closed.

Castiel: No, it's not. I was just there.

Eremiel: I'm sorry. I said that wrong. Heaven is closed to you. Orders.

Castiel: Eremiel. I am going to Heaven.

Eremiel: That's what everyone thinks.

(In Heaven Jack was making his angels) Dumah: Ohh! It's working, Jack. (She sees Eremiel coming in the room) Really Eremiel? (Cas threw him to the floor as Dumah was surprised) Castiel! Good news. I found Jack.

Jack: Cas! Look! I'm making angels.

Castiel: Yes, you, uh -- Dumah. A word? Now!

BUNKER

Sam: I-I don't think this is gonna work.

Dean: One way to find out.

[ Sighs ] Jack.

[ Sighs ] I hope you can hear this.

Sam: I hope you can hear this. Some things -- Some things, some bad things happened. But we're family. We're your family. A-And bad things happen in families. Bad things happen in families. But we, uh. We, uh -- We want to talk with you. That's how we can all get through this. That's how we can all move forward.

HEAVEN

Castiel: I know what you're doing. You're using Jack to solidify your hold on Heaven.

Dumah: Someone has loose lips.

Castiel: You're establishing a reign of terror, beating humans into submission, stripping Heaven of its mercy.

Dumah: Oh, Heaven never really had any mercy, Castiel. You know that. I am saving Heaven. I am saving our kind. I am saving the world.

BUNKER

Sam: Jack, we want -- We need to see you. Our mother would want it. Your mother would want it. Your mother would want it.

Dumah: I can't control Jack. You've seen his strength.

Castiel: He's strong, yes, but still a child and without a soul to guide him.

Dumah: I can guide him.

BUNKER

Sam: Jack, we just want things to be the way they were. We just want things to be the way they were. Are you hearing this?

HEAVEN

Sam (echoing): Are you hearing this?

Jack (to himself): I am.

HEAVEN (HALLWAY)

Castiel: I'm getting Jack out of here.

Dumah: No you're not.

Castiel: You really want this fight, Dumah?

Dumah: Fight? I'm holding the high cards here. Ma and Pa Winchester, they're living in their own personal Heaven. One snap of these fingers, and all of that ends.

Castiel: (Cas was so done as he took out his blade and kills Dumah) Jack? Jack!

BUNKER

Sam: Guess he didn't hear.

Jack: I heard. And I was so glad. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. I've been working with the angels to purify the world. Oh, and making angels. Yeah. I make angels. But I really missed you guys.

Dean: Yeah. Us too. Right, Sammy? Tell Jack how, uh -- how we want to clear things up, you know, between us.

Jack: I know -- I know things have been bad. A-And, if it helps, I regret it. The accident.

Sam: The -- The accident?

Jack: What happened to Mary. She kept talking about my soul, t-that I didn't have a soul, and she kept pushing.

Dean: Oh, so she made you do it.

Jack: No, it -- it was me, but I didn't want this no-soul thing to become an issue between us. I guess I snapped. Before I knew it, it was all over.

Dean: "It" being the accident.

Jack: I wish it didn't happen.

Dean: Yeah, Jack. So do we. But w-we understand. And we forgive you.You know, for the, uh, accident.

Sam: That's what you want, right, Jack? I mean, you -- you -- you'd like that?

Jack: I'd like for things to go back the way they were. I knew you'd understand.

Dean: So if we told you that we were close to being able to fix your soul, we just need to keep you safe until everything is ready, you -- you'd be okay with that?

Jack: Safe -- What do you mean?

Dean: Well, you could hurt other people. Have another, uh, accident.

Jack: Oh.

Sam: We -- We want to keep you safe, Jack. That also means we -- we have to keep you safe from yourself. You know, just so nobody else gets hurt, just until we get you better.

Dean: Well, there she is. It's actually kind of comfortable. Uh, and its best feature is that it's warded, so it keeps your powers below the meltdown level.

Sam: Yeah, so you can't hurt anyone and n-nobody can hurt you.

Jack: I understand.

Jack: So, uh -- Okay.

Dean: Um, do I just--

Dean: Just hop on in.

Jack: Hm. Not bad.

Dean: Hey. Told ya.

Jack: How long before I can come out?

Sam: Not too long. Jack, we got this.

Jack: Okay. (As he lays down in the box Sam gets upset and leaves the room.)

== ACT FIVE==

Jack: Are you guys still there? Sam?! Dean?! Sam? Sam? Dean? You still there? (They waited out in the hall for a moment then the boys went to the kitchen for a drink)

Sam: So what do we do now? Just go on with Jack locked up in there forever?

Dean: If we have to.

Sam: I don't know if I can do that.

Dean: I tell you what. This stuff Ketch left, it's not bad.

Sam: You know, I never thought it would end like this with Jack.

Dean: Sammy, we knew from the beginning it was a long shot with him.

Sam: Yeah. Yeah, but long shots are kind of our thing.

Jack: Guys? I don't think I like this!

Nick: Look at you, buddy. Ahh. You got played, man. Uh, I got to hand it to the Winchesters. They still got game.

Jack: They -- They said I should trust them.

Nick: And you believed that crap? Buddy, buddy, trust is a two-way street, man. If they trusted you, why did they lock you up? You, my friend, are screwed.

Castiel: Sam. Dean. There's news. Dumah was manipulating Jack into doing those things. She told him it would please you.

Dean: Oh, so now it's our fault?

Castiel: I'm just saying it's urgent that we find him and tell him.

Sam: Cas, he's here.

Castiel: What?

Dean: He's locked up, safe. He's in the Ma'lak box.

Castiel: No!

Dean: And that's where he's gonna stay.

Nick: Am I getting through to you? Did they tell you the specifics of their cure? Are you getting a new soul? Does it have a factory warranty? Why didn't they tell you how much time it would take?

Jack: I don't know.

Nick: You don't know because you, my friend, are naive, clueless, trusting. And you know what? They suckered you. Why? you may ask? Okay. One, 'cause you're no longer useful to them. And, two, you killed their mother. Okay? There's no coming back from that. So this is it, for the rest of time. (Jack uses his powers to try and bust out of the box) I'm sorry. Is that it? You have to do way better than that, buddy.

Castiel: Even after hearing what I said, you want to keep Jack sealed in a living death?

Dean: He agreed to it. Because deep down, I think he knows it's best.

Castiel: No. You're doing what Dumah -- You are manipulating him.

Nick: Bring it.

Sam: Cas.

Castiel: What? You just want to forget about him?

Dean: I wish I could forget about him! After what he did? And you know what he can do. This is our only play. (Suddenly an explosion went off in the bunker as the alarms kicked in. Cas, Dean and Sam rushed to the room where it looked as if a bomb had gone off. Out of the smoke and fire Jack comes out with his eyes glowing and angry.)

Sam: Jack.
