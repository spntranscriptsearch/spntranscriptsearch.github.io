TEASER
INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Dr. George Waxler, M.D. (according to the business card on the table) is sitting across from his patient, Scott Carey. A tape recorder sits on the table between them.

Soundtrack: "White Rabbit" by Jefferson Airplane plays over the following scene.

DR. WAXLER
Don't be afraid, Scott. You can tell me anything, you know that. Whatever you say won't leave this room.

SCOTT
It started a little over a year ago. Migraines at first. Then I found I could do . . . stuff.

DR. WAXLER
What do you mean, "do stuff"?

SCOTT
I have this ability. When I touch something, I can electrocute it if I want.

DR. WAXLER
How do you know?

SCOTT
I did it to the neighbor's cat. Its insides fried up like a hamburger.

DR. WAXLER frowns and takes a note, his face passive.
SCOTT
You don't believe me.

DR. WAXLER
I believe that you believe it.

SCOTT
(leans forward, extending his hand)
Then here. Wanna shake on it?

DR. WAXLER
Why would you want to kill the neighbor's cat?

SCOTT
I don't. He wants me to, and he doesn't want me to stop there.

DR. WAXLER
Who?

SCOTT
The yellow-eyed man. He comes to me in my dreams. Tells me to do things, awful things. But I tell him no, no, I don't want to!

DR. WAXLER
What else does the yellow-eyed man tell you?

SCOTT
He . . . he has plans for me.

DR. WAXLER
What kind of plans?


EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

SCOTT is walking alone under a dark and creepy train track. He hears something.

SCOTT
Hello?

As he gets to his car, he sees a dark figure reflected in the window. SCOTT turns slowly and sees that it's a man holding a knife. The man stabs SCOTT twice, killing him. Blood flows from his mouth.

EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY
A continuation from the final scene of Croatoan: The Impala is parked under a tree, and SAM and DEAN are drinking beer by the fence around a small lake.

DEAN
Before Dad died he, he told me something — something about you.

SAM
What? Dean, what did he tell you?

DEAN
He said that he wanted me to watch out for you, to take care of you.

SAM
He told you that a million times.

DEAN
No, this time was different. He said that I had to save you.

SAM
Save me from what?

DEAN
He just said that I had to save you, that nothing else mattered; and that if I couldn't, I'd . . .

SAM
You'd what, Dean?

DEAN
That I'd have to kill you. He said that I might have to kill you, Sammy.

SAM
Kill me? What the hell is that supposed to mean?

DEAN
I don't know.

SAM
I mean, he must have had some kind of reason for saying it, right? Did he know the demon's plans for me? Am I supposed to go Darkside or something? What else did he say, Dean?

DEAN
Nothing, that's it, I swear.

SAM
How could you not have told me this?

DEAN
Because it was Dad, and he begged me not to.

SAM
Who cares?! Take some responsibility for yourself, Dean! You had no right to keep this from me!

DEAN
You think I wanted this? Huh? I wish to God he'd never opened his mouth. Then I wouldn't have to walk around with this screaming in my head all day.

SAM turns and takes a few steps away, fuming.

SAM
We've just got to figure out what's going on, then, what the hell all this means.

DEAN
We do? I've been thinking about this, I think we should just lay low. You know? At least for a while. It'd be safer. And that way I can make sure —

SAM
What? That I don't turn evil? That I don't turn into some kind of killer?

DEAN
I never said that.

SAM
Jeez, if you're not careful you will have to waste me one day, Dean.

DEAN
I never said that! Damnit, Sam, this whole thing is spinning out of control. All right? You're immune to some weirdo demon virus, and I don't even know what the hell anymore. And you're pissed at me, I get it. That's fine, I deserve it. But we lay low until we figure out our next move, okay?

SAM
Forget it.

DEAN
Sam, please, man. Hey, please. Just give me some time. Give me some time to think, okay? I'm begging you here, please. Please.

SAM nods reluctantly.

EXT. VELVET INN MOTEL - NIGHT

EPISODE TITLE:
HUNTED

SAM leaves a motel room alone, a bag over his shoulder. He walks quietly past the Impala to a small black car; he opens the door with a coat hanger, looks around, and gets in. He drives away.

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

SAM is standing outside a dark house, holding a piece of motel stationery from The Blue Rose Motel, with an address written on it. He approaches the house cautiously. He picks the lock and enters; the house is dark. As he passes through the doorway he trips a wire at floor level, which triggers a grenade. It explodes; he screams. A close shot of his smoking boots dissolves into a flash of light, then into:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

AVA, a young woman (born in 1983, perhaps?) wakes up from the vision/nightmare, gasping. The MAN behind her stirs.

MAN
Hey, honey?

AVA
Oh.

MAN
You okay?

AVA
No, I just had another nightmare. It's fine, it's nothing. Just go back to sleep.

MAN
You sure?

AVA
Yeah.

She lies down again, still panting.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

SAM enters the ROADHOUSE, and heads turn. ELLEN is behind the bar, and looks up as he approaches. She smiles knowingly.

ELLEN
Sam.

SAM
Hey, Ellen.
(grinning sheepishly)
You don't seem that surprised to see me.

ELLEN
Well, your brother's been calling, worried sick, looking for you.

SAM
Yeah. Figured he might.

ELLEN
What's going on between you two?

SAM
So, um, how's Jo?

ELLEN
(nodding)
Well, I don't really know.

SAM
What do you mean?

ELLEN
Well, I haven't seen her in weeks. She sends a postcard now and again.

SAM
Well, what happened?

ELLEN
Well, after she worked that job with you boys she decided she wanted to keep on hunting. I said "not under my roof", and she said "fine".

SAM
So I'm probably the last person you want to see right now.

ELLEN
(throaty chuckle)
Oh, don't get me wrong. I wish I could blame the hell out of you boys. It'd be easier. Truth is, it's not your fault. Sam. None of it is. I want you to know that I forgave your daddy a long time ago for what happened to my Bill. I just don't think he ever forgave himself.

SAM
What did happen?

ELLEN
Um, so, why did you come here, sweetie?

SAM
I need help.



LATER

ELLEN and SAM are talking to ASH, who is looking around furtively.

ASH
What am I looking for, Sam?

SAM
Other people, other psychics, like me. As many as possible, and I need a nationwide search.

ELLEN
But I thought there was no way to track them all down. Not all of them had nursery fires like you did.

SAM
Well, no, but some had to. Start there.



LATER

ASH emerges from his back room with a piece of paper in his hand. He gives it a flourish.

ASH
Done, and done.

SAM
That was fast.

ASH
Well, apparently, that's my job. Make the monkey dance at the keyboard.

ELLEN
Just tell us what you got, Ash.

ASH
Four folks fit the profile nationwide. Born in '83, mother died in a nursery fire, the whole shebang.

SAM
Four? That's it?

ASH
Sam Winchester from Lawrence, Kansas, Max Miller from Saginaw, Michigan, Andrew Gallagher from Guthrie, Oklahoma, and uh, another name. Scott Carey.

SAM
You got an address?

ASH
Kind of. The Arbor Hill Cemetery in Lafayette, Indiana. Plot four-eighty-six.

SAM
So he's dead?

ASH
Killed, about a month ago.

SAM
Killed how?

ASH
Stabbed. Parking lot. Fuzz don't have much, no suspects,

SAM
All right. Thank you.

As he gets up to leave, ASH slaps him on the back; when he's out of eyeshot ASH picks up SAM'S half-full beer and starts drinking it.

ELLEN
Where are you going?

SAM
Indiana.

ELLEN
Sam? I've gotta call Dean, I've gotta let him know where you are.

SAM
Ellen. I'm trying to find answers, about who I am. And my brother means well, but he can't protect me from that. Please.

ELLEN nods reluctantly.



INT. CAREY HOUSE - DAY

SAM is sitting with SCOTT'S father in his living room, talking.

MR. CAREY
So you say you went to high school with Scott?

SAM
Uh, yes sir, I did. I just heard about what happened, I'm so sorry.

MR. CAREY
Scotty was a good boy. He changed a lot since you knew him.

SAM
What do you mean?

MR. CAREY
It started about a year ago with these headaches. And then he got depressed, paranoid, nightmares.

SAM
Nightmares? Um, did he ever talk to you about his nightmares? What he saw, or,

MR. CAREY
No, no. He closed up with me. I tried to get him help, but nothing took. He'd just lock himself in his room for days.

SAM
You think maybe I could see his room?



INT. SCOTT'S ROOM - DAY

SAM pokes around. The room contains a bare bed with a sleeping bag, some bookshelves covered in books and cassette tapes. On the bedside table he sees several bottles of pills, prescribed by Dr. George Waxler. SAM looks behind him, then pockets one bottle. He opens SCOTT'S closet and shoves aside the clothes to reveal a collage of yellow eyes cut out of photos or magazines, glued to the wall. He stares.



EXT. BLUE ROSE MOTEL - NIGHT

SAM walks across the parking lot. As he gets to the door he senses he's being followed; he turns and grabs the figure behind him, shoving her against the wall. It is AVA.

SAM
Who are you?

AVA
Please! You're in danger.



INT. BLUE ROSE MOTEL - NIGHT

AVA is pacing, talking somewhat frantically.

AVA
Okay, look, I know how all this sounds, but I am not insane and I am not on drugs. Okay? I am normal, and this is way, way off the map for me.

SAM
All right, all right, just, just calm down. Okay? What's your name?

AVA
Ava.

SAM
Ava?

AVA
Ava Wilson.

SAM
Ava, I'm Sam Winchester, all right? Now, you were telling me about these dreams of yours?

AVA
Uh, yeah, uh, okay, about a year ago I started having these, like, headaches, and just, nightmares, I guess. And I really didn't think much of it until I had this one dream where I saw this guy get stabbed in a parking lot.

SAM
When was this?

AVA
Uh, about a month ago. But, anyway, a couple of days later, I found this.

She pulls out a newspaper clipping and hands it to SAM; it reads "LOCAL MAN STABBED TO DEATH IN PARKING LOT" next to a picture of SCOTT CAREY. SAM takes the clipping.

AVA
I saw this guy die, days before it happened. I don't know why, I don't know, it's just for some reason, my dreams are coming true. And last night I had another one.

SAM
Okay.

AVA
About you. I saw you die.

SAM
How did you find me?

AVA
Oh, uh, you had motel stationery, and I Googled the motel, and it was real, and so I just thought that I should warn you.

SAM
I don't believe this.

AVA
Oh, oh, of course you don't. You think I'm a total nutjob.

SAM
Wait, no, no, no, I mean, you must be one of us.

AVA
Sorry, one of, one of who?

SAM
One of the Psychics. Like me. Look, Ava, I have visions too, all right? So we're connected.

AVA
(laughs)
Okay, so, you're nuts. That's great.

SAM
Okay, okay, look. Did your mother happen to die in a house fire?

AVA
No, my mother lives in Palm Beach!

SAM
So you don't fit the pattern either.

AVA frowns at him in confusion.



EXT. BLACKTOP - NIGHT

DEAN is driving alone, and his cell phone rings. He picks up.

DEAN
Hello?

ELLEN
(at the ROADHOUSE)
It's Ellen.

DEAN
Hey, have you heard from Sam?

ELLEN
I have, but he made me promise not to tell you where he is.

DEAN
Come on, Ellen, please. Something bad could be going on here, and I swore I'd look after that kid.

ELLEN
Now Dean, they say you can't protect your loved ones forever.
(beat)
Well, I say screw that. What else is family for? He's in Lafayette, Indiana.

DEAN
Thanks.



INT. BLUE ROSE MOTEL - NIGHT

AVA
Why can't you just leave town? Please? Before you blow up?

SAM
No, I can't.

AVA
Oh, god. Why not?

SAM
Because there's something going on here, Ava. With you, with me. I mean, there are others like us out there. And we're all a part of something, and I've got to figure out what.

AVA
Okay. you know what? Screw you, buddy. Okay? Because I'm a secretary from Peoria and I'm not part of anything! Okay? Do you see this?
(she fingers her engagement ring)
I am getting married in eight weeks. I am supposed to be at home addressing invitations, which I am way behind on, by the way. But instead, I drove out here to save your weirdo ass. But if you just want to stay here and die, fine. Me? I'm due back on Planet Earth.

SAM
Don't you want to know why this is happening? I mean, don't these visions scare the hell out of you? Because if you walk out that door right now you might never know the truth. I need your help.



INT. DR. WAXLER'S OFFICE - DAY

AVA is sitting in WAXLER'S office in a therapy session, to cover for SAM'S mission of covert theft.

DR. WAXLER
So, Ms. Wilson, you're new in town.

AVA
That's right.

DR. WAXLER
And what made you decided to seek out therapy?

AVA
I have no idea.

DR. WAXLER
No?

AVA
No. I mean, I'm feeling really super anxious right now,

DR. WAXLER
Okay, anything else?

AVA
Um . . .
(she sees SAM inching by on the window ledge outside)
Holy crap!

DR. WAXLER
What?
(he turns to the window as a few pigeons fly off)

AVA
I just remembered, when I was a kid, I swallowed like, eight things of pop rocks and then drank a whole can of coke, you don't think that that counts as a suicide attempt, do you?



INT. BLUE ROSE MOTEL - DAY

AVA and SAM return to the motel room with SCOTT'S files. AVA looks stunned.

SAM
Are you okay?

AVA
Am I okay?

SAM
Yeah.

AVA
I just helped you steal some dead guy's confidential psych files. I'm awesome!



LATER

The voice recorder from the Teaser is sitting on the table, next to an open file folder. A record from the therapy session is playing.

SCOTT'S VOICE
It started a little over a year ago. Migraines, at first. Then I found I could do . . . stuff.

WAXLER'S VOICE
What do you mean, do stuff?

SCOTT'S VOICE
I have this ability. When I touch something, I can electrocute it if I want.



EXT. BLUE ROSE MOTEL - DAY

DEAN pulls into the parking lot in the Impala; when he sees SAM through the window of his room he sighs in relief.

DEAN
Oh, thank god you're okay.

SAM moves aside, revealing AVA through the window. DEAN smiles.

DEAN
Oh, you're better than okay. Sam, you sly dog!



INT. BLUE ROSE MOTEL - DAY

The recording continues; SAM is leaning over the table, looking more concerned.

WAXLER'S VOICE
What else does the yellow-eyed man say?

SCOTT'S VOICE
He has plans for me. He says there's a war coming. That people like me, we're going to be the soldiers. Everything's about to change.
(the recording ends)

AVA
He's not talking about us, right?

SAM
Yeah, I think he is.

AVA
But how can we turn into that?

SAM
I don't -

The window above SAM'S head shatters as it's hit with a bullet. He dives to the floor with AVA, shielding her body with his.

SAM
Get down!

AVA
Oh my god!



EXT. MOTEL - DAY

Across the street, GORDON is on a rooftop with a sniper rifle; he continues to take aim and fire at the motel room.



INT. MOTEL - DAY

AVA
What's happening?

SAM
I don't know.



EXT MOTEL - DAY

As GORDON is about to take another head-shot at SAM, DEAN jumps him from behind.

DEAN
Gordon!

DEAN kicks GORDON hard, then pins him down on his back, hitting him over and over again in the face. He grabs him by the collar.

DEAN
You do that to my brother, I'll kill you!

GORDON
Dean, wait.

GORDON manages to grab the rifle and slam it into DEAN twice, knocking him out. He stands over DEAN, panting and gushing blood from his lip.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXT. MOTEL ROOF - DAY

AVA and SAM investigate the roof from which GORDON was shooting at them.

AVA
Wait, I don't understand. Shouldn't we be talking to the cops?

SAM
Trust me, that wouldn't do us much good.
(picking up a shell)
These are .223 caliber. Subsonic rounds. The guy must have put a suppressor on the rifle.

AVA
Dude, who are you?

SAM
Oh. I just, uh, I just watch a lot of TJ Hooker.

He pulls out his cell phone.

AVA
Who are you calling?

SAM
My brother. I think we definitely need help.



INT. CABIN - DAY

DEAN is tied to a chair, and GORDON is holding the phone to his ear.

DEAN
Hello?

SAM
Dean!

DEAN
Sam, I've been looking for you.

SAM
Yeah. Look, I'm in Indiana, uh Lafayette.

DEAN
I know.

SAM
You do?

DEAN
Yeah, I talked to Ellen. Just got here myself. It's a real funky town. You ditched me, Sammy.

SAM
Yeah, I'm sorry. Look, right now there's someone after me.

DEAN
What? Who?

SAM
I don't know, that's what we need to find out. Where are you?

DEAN
I'm staying at, uh, 5637 Monroe St. Why don't you meet me here?

SAM
Yeah. Sure.
(hangs up.)



INT. CABIN - NIGHT

GORDON
Now, was that so hard?

DEAN
Bite me.



EXT. MOTEL ROOF - DAY

SAM is putting his phone away, looking worried.

AVA
What is it?

SAM
My brother's in trouble.

AVA
What?

SAM
He gave me a codeword. Someone's got a gun on him.

AVA
Codeword?

SAM
Yeah. Funkytown.
(beat)
Well, he thought of it. It's kind of a . . .long story. I ... come on.



INT. CABIN - DAY

GORDON has his back to DEAN; he opens a canvas bag and starts pulling out weapons.

DEAN
So Gordy. I know me and Sam ain't exactly your favorite people, but don't you think this is a little extreme?

GORDON
What, you think this is revenge?

DEAN
Well, we did leave you tied up in your own mess for three days.
(laughs)
Which was awesome. Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.

GORDON
Yeah. I was definitely planning on whuppin' your ass for that.

DEAN
Mm-hmm.

GORDON
But that's not what this is. This isn't personal. I'm not a killer, Dean. I'm a hunter. And your brother's fair game.

He slams a knife into its sheath; cut to DEAN'S shocked face.



EXT. STREET - DAY

SAM and AVA approach her blue VW beetle.

AVA
I don't think I should leave.

SAM
I want you out of harm's way, Ava.

AVA
What about you?

SAM
Harm's way doesn't really bother me.

AVA
No, but you are walking right into my vision. I mean, this is how you die.

SAM
Doesn't matter. It's my brother.

AVA
Maybe I could help!

SAM
You've done all you can. Just, just go back to your fiance.

AVA
Are you sure?

SAM
Yes, I'm sure. Go home, Ava. You'll be safe there.

AVA
(she gets in the car)
Well, just, promise me you'll call, then. I mean, when you get your brother, just to let me know that everything's all right.

SAM
I promise.



INT. CABIN - DAY

GORDON is leaning against a pillar, cradling a rifle and speaking casually.

GORDON
See, I was doing an exorcism down in Louisiana. Teenage girl, seemed routine, some low-level demon. But between all the jabbering and the head-spinning, the damn thing muttered something. About a coming war. And I don't think it meant to, it just kind of slipped out. But it was too late. Piqued my interest. And you can really make a demon talk, you got the right tools.

DEAN
And what happened to the girl it was possessing?

GORDON
She didn't make it.

DEAN
(shaking his head)
Well, you're a son of a bitch.

GORDON stares, stands, and slaps him.

GORDON
That's my momma you're talking about.
(beat)
Anyway. This demon tells me there are soldiers to fight in this coming war. Humans, fighting on hell's side. You believe that? I mean, they're psychics, so they're not exactly pure humans, but still. What kind of worthless scumbag have you got to be to turn against your own race?
(DEAN glares)
But you know the biggest kick in the ass? This demon said I knew one of them. Our very own Sammy Winchester.

DEAN
(chuckles)
Oh, this is ... this is a whole new level of moronic, even for you.

GORDON
Yeah? Come on, Dean. I know. About Sam's visions. I know everything.

DEAN
Really? Because a demon told you?
(laughs)
Yeah, and it wasn't lying.

GORDON
Hey, Dean. I'm not some reckless yahoo, okay? I did my homework. Made damn sure it was true. Look, you've got your Roadhouse connections, I got mine. It's how I found Sammy in the first place.
(he crosses to the corner and sits)
About a month ago I found another one of these freaks here in town. He could deep-fry a person just by touching them.

DEAN
Yeah, did he kill anyone?

GORDON
Well, besides Mr. Tinkles the cat? No. But he was working up to it. They're all gonna be killers, Dean. We've got to take them all out. And that means Sammy too.
(he cocks the rifle)

DEAN
You think Sam's stupid enough to walk through that front door?

GORDON
No, I don't. Especially since I'm sure you found a way to warn him. Ha. You really think I'm that stupid?
(DEAN raises his eyebrows meaningfully; GORDON stands and starts pacing. )
No. Sammy's going to scope the place first, see me covering the front door. So he's going to take the back. And when he does he'll hit the tripwire. Then --
(he takes a grenade from his bag)
Boom.

DEAN
Sam's not gonna fall for a friggin' tripwire.

GORDON
Maybe you're right. That's why I'll have a second one.
(beat)
Hey, look. I'm sorry. I wish I didn't have to do this, I really do. But for what it's worth, it'll be quick.

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Close shot of GORDON setting up the tripwire across the back doorway; he returns to the room where DEAN is tied up and straddles a chair.

DEAN
Come on, man. I know Sam, okay, better than anyone. He's got more of a conscience than I do, I mean, the guy feels guilty surfing the Internet for porn.

GORDON
Maybe you're right. But one day he's going to be a monster.

DEAN
How? Huh? How's a guy like Sam become a monster?

GORDON
Beats me. But he will.

DEAN
No, you don't know that!

GORDON
I'm surprised at you, Dean. Getting all emotional. I'd heard you were more of a professional than this. Look, let's say you were cruising around in that car of yours and, uh, you had little Hitler riding shotgun, right? Back when he was just some goofy, crappy artist. But you knew what he was going to turn into someday. You'd take him out, no questions, am I right?

DEAN
That's not Sam.

GORDON
Yes it is. You just can't see it yet. Dean, it's his destiny. Look, I'm sympathetic. He's your brother, you love the guy. This has got to hurt like hell for you.
(he reaches into his bag and pulls out a scarf, stands)
But here's the thing.
(he gags DEAN with the scarf)
It would wreck him. But your dad? If it really came right down to it, he would have had the stones to do the right thing here. But you're telling me you're not the man he is?

DEAN glares furiously.



EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

Just like AVA'S vision from ACT ONE, SAM approaches the cabin, holding up the sheet of motel stationery. He sees DEAN, and GORDON, through the boarded-up window, then runs around back. He tries the door and finds it locked; he pulls out his lockpick and works it open.



INT. CABIN - NIGHT

The clicks from the door can be heard in the front room; DEAN looks around wildly.

GORDON
Ya hear him?

In the back room, SAM gets the door open and creeps in.

GORDON
Here he comes.

DEAN flinches helplessly as the first grenade explodes. He screams at GORDON through his gag.

GORDON
Hold on. Not yet. Just wait and see.

As the second grenade goes off, DEAN struggles violently, choke-sobbing through the gag. GORDON crosses the room and stops beside him.

GORDON
Sorry, Dean.

He goes into the back room, rifle ready. He sees Sam's smoking boots on the ground, just like in the vision. He smiles but is still wary. As he turns away from the back door, SAM raises a gun to the back of GORDON'S head and cocks it.

SAM
(low, warning)
Drop the gun.

GORDON
Shouldn't take your shoes off around here. You might get tetanus.

SAM
(shouting)
Put it down now!

In the front room, DEAN turns, hearing SAM'S voice, and grunts in relief. Out back, GORDON slowly lowers the rifle to the floor.

GORDON
You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Sammy? Because your brother, he thinks you're some kind of saint.

SAM
Yeah? Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

GORDON
See, that's what I said.

He turns quickly, knocking the gun out of SAM'S hand and attacking him methodically until he goes down. In the front room, DEAN hears the scuffle and struggles against the ropes, groaning in frustration. Out back, GORDON slowly approaches SAM, who's flat on his back, coughing. GORDON pulls out his knife.

GORDON
You're no better than the filthy things you hunt.

As GORDON raises the knife, SAM lashes out, flipping GORDON over. He punches him twice, then grabs the rifle and points it at his head.

GORDON
Do it. Do it! Show your brother the killer you really are, Sammy.

SAM hesitates, then slams the butt of the rifle into GORDON'S head, knocking him out.

SAM
(fuming)
It's Sam.

INT. CABIN (FRONT ROOM) - NIGHT

SAM shuffles exhaustedly into the room where DEAN is tied up; DEAN looks up emotionally as he watches SAM approach. SAM claps him on the shoulder as he kneels beside him, untying the ropes. DEAN pulls off his own gag frantically, stands, and pulls SAM up to standing. He cups his hand around SAM'S neck, staring at him closely, cataloging his injuries, and Sam nods at him. and SAM claps a hand to DEAN'S shoulder. DEAN wheels around to head to the back room.

DEAN
That son of a . . .

SAM
Dean. No.

DEAN
I let him live once. I'm not making the same mistake twice.

SAM
Trust me. Gordon's taken care of. Come on.

He reaches out and fists DEAN'S jacket, pulling him towards the front door.



EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN walk -- Sam staggering -- down the steps from the cabin and away from it. Moments later GORDON emerges, a gun in each hand, and begins firing. SAM and DEAN duck and run for cover.

DEAN
Come on! (As they run:) You call this taken care of?
(They dive into a ditch by the side of the road and huddle, watching him approach.)
What the hell are we doing?

SAM
Just trust me on this, all right?

As GORDON approaches, three police cars, sirens blaring, pull into the clearing and surround GORDON. Cops emerge, weapons ready.

COP 1
Drop your weapons! Get down on your knees!

COP 2
Do it, now!

SAM and DEAN grin at each other as GORDON drops to his knees. GORDON glares in their direction.

COP 2
Put your hands on your head. Easy now.

The cop cuffs GORDON and pats him down, then leads him to a squad car. Another opens the back door of GORDON'S red car and pulls out the weapons rack.

SAM
Anonymous tip.

DEAN
You're a fine upstanding citizen, Sam.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. HARVELLE'S ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

Inside, ELLEN is on the phone, talking to DEAN and keeping her voice down.

ELLEN
Gordon Walker was hunting Sam?



EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

DEAN
(on the phone, outside; SAM is in the car, looking at his own cellphone.)
Yeah, he almost killed us both because somebody over there can't keep their friggin' mouth shut.

ELLEN
And you honestly think that it was me? Or Ash? Or Jo? No way.

DEAN
Well, who else knows about Sam, huh? (Dean turns to look at Sam in the car.) I mean, you must have been talking to somebody.

ELLEN
Hey, you can say a lot of things about us. But we are not disloyal. And we're not stupid. We haven't breathed a word of this.

DEAN
Gordon said he had Roadhouse connections, Ellen.

ELLEN
And this roadhouse is full of other hunters. They're all smart. They're good trackers. Each of them with their own patterns and connections. Look, hell, I could name twelve of them right now that are capable of putting this together.
(sighs)
I am sorry about what happened, Dean. But I can't control these people. Or what they choose to believe.



EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

DEAN is driving; SAM is talking on his phone.

SAM
Hey, Ava, it's Sam. Again. Um, call me when you get this, just want to make sure you got home okay. All right. Bye.

DEAN
Everything all right?

SAM
Yeah, I hope so.

DEAN
Well, Gordon should be reaching for the soap for the next few years at least.

SAM
Yeah. If they pin Scott Carey's murder on him. And if he doesn't bust out.

(Pause)

DEAN
Dude, you ever take off like that again . . .

SAM
What? You'll kill me?

DEAN
That is so not funny.

SAM
(laughs)
All right. All right. So where to next, then?

DEAN
One word: Amsterdam.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN
Come on, man, I hear the coffeeshops don't even serve coffee.

SAM
I'm not just gonna ditch the job.

DEAN
Screw the job. Screw it, man, I'm sick of the job anyway. I mean, we don't get paid, we don't get thanked. The only thing we get's bad luck.

SAM
Well, come on, dude, you're a hunter. I mean, it's what you were meant to do.

DEAN
Ah, I wasn't meant to do anything, I don't believe in that destiny crap.

SAM
You mean you don't believe in my destiny.

DEAN
Yeah, whatever.

SAM
Look, Dean, I've tried running before. I mean, I ran all the way to California and look what happened. You can't run from this. And you can't protect me.

Dean looks at him.

DEAN
I can try.

SAM
(quietly)
Thanks for that.
(DEAN nods)
Look, Dean, I'm gonna keep hunting. I mean, whatever is coming, I'm taking it head-on, so if you really want to watch my back, then I guess you're gonna have to stick around.

DEAN
Bitch.

SAM
Jerk.

They both grin; after a beat, SAM frowns and picks up his phone again.

DEAN
You calling that Ava girl again? You sweet on her or something?

SAM
She's engaged, Dean.

DEAN
So? What's the point in saving the world if you can't get a little nookie once in a while, huh?
(SAM hangs up, scowling in thought)
What?

SAM
Just a feeling. How far is it to Peoria?



EXT. AVA WILSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN do their breaking and entering thing, with flashlights.

SAM
Hello? Is anybody home?

They go into the bedroom to find AVA'S fiance dead, face-up on the bed; his shirt and the sheets are soaked in blood.

SAM
Oh my god.

DEAN runs a finger along the windowsill, staring at the powdery substance collected there.

DEAN
Hey. (Sam turns. Dean holds up his fingers.) Sulfur. Demon's been here.

SAM sees something on the floor and kneels, picking it up. It is AVA'S engagement ring.

SAM
(whispers)
Ava.

Episode 510 Scene 8
<Int. Harvelle's Roadhouse: Ash fails to get a date. Sam asks Ash to find other kids who survived nursery fires. TRT 1:16>

A GIRL is playing pool, she leans over the table lining up her shot as ASH approaches.

ASH
Girl, I'm gonna take you to Waffle House.

GIRL tilts her head in bemusement.

ASH
No. Olive Garden.

GIRL straightens up from the table looking at ASH.

ASH
You... You mind driving though? I ain't got no license.

GIRL (walking away)
I think I just decided I'm gay.

ASH (taking her hand)
Well hey, I mean, that's even better.

GIRL removes her hand and walks away.

ASH
Oh hey, where you going? Give me some sugar.

SAM approaches ASH while he is calling to the GIRL who is over at the bar.

ASH
Baby!

SAM
Hey Ash.

ASH
Sam I am.

ELLEN comes over.

SAM
I.. uh, I need you to find something for me.

ASH
Oh, come on, man. I was working my game here. You're c-blocking.

ELLEN (reprovingly)
Ash.

ASH
So, what am I looking for, Sam?

SAM
Other people, other psychics, like me. As many as possible, and I need a nationwide search.

ELLEN
But I thought there was no way to track them all down. Not all of them had nursery fires like you did.

SAM
Well, no, but some had to. Start there.


Scene #20
Episode 510 Scene 20 (extended version)
<Int. Motel Room: Ava tells Sam about her vision of is death. TRT 1:54>

AVA
So if you're so psychic, then why didn't you see your own death?

SAM
I don't know. I've never really had premonitions about myself before.

AVA (sighing)
This is crazy.

SAM
Hey, you tracked me down because you saw me die in a dream. I'd say we're miles past crazy. So I die in an abandoned house?

AVA
Yeah. Some kind of a bomb or something.

SAM
What'd my killer look like?

AVA
I don't know.

SAM
Well, was it human?

AVA
What the hell else would it be? No. Actually, you know what? Don't answer that. I don't wanna know. Look, can you just leave town? Please? Like, before you blow up?

SAM
No, I can't.

AVA
Oh, god. Why not?

SAM
Because there's something going on here, Ava. With you, with me. I mean, there are others like us out there. And we're all a part of something, and I've got to figure out what.

AVA
Okay. you know what? Screw you, buddy. Okay? I am a secretary from Peoria and I'm not part of anything! Okay? Do you see this?
(she fingers her engagement ring)
I am getting married in eight weeks. I should be at home addressing invitations. But instead, I drove out here to save your weirdo ass. But fine, if you wanna stay here and die, fine. Me? I'm due back on Planet Earth.

SAM
Don't you want to know why this is happening? I mean, don't these visions scare the hell out of you? Because if you walk out that door right now you might never know the truth. I need your help.
