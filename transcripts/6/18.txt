TEASER
EXT. STREET

(A noose is hanging from a gallows.)

Sunrise, Wyoming
March 5, 1861
(Two cowboys step into the street. A woman peers at them through a window. They face each other from several metres apart. They open their coats and have their hands ready to draw their guns. A man watches them through a window. One cowboy is wearing a Sheriff badge. It's Dean. A clock strikes noon. The men look at each other and draw their guns. The screen goes black and a gunshot is heard.)

ACT I
EXT. CAMPBELL'S COMPOUND (48 hours earlier and 150 years later)

SAM It's here, somewhere. I know it. (to Bobby) Help me move this.

INT. CAMPBELL'S COMPOUND

Sam and Bobby move Samuel's desk, revealing a trapdoor.

BOBBY I'll be damned.

(Sam, Dean and Bobby all head down the ladder)

SAM Welcome to the Campbell family library.

DEAN So, Samuel collected all this stuff, huh?

SAM Apparently.

DEAN Wow. All right, well, what are we looking for?

BOBBY Well, anything that'll put a run in the Octomom's stockings. Pick a row.

(all three start looking through the books in the library)'

BOBBY Bingo. (all three sit at the table in the middle of the room) Either of you jokers ever heard anything about a Phoenix?

DEAN River, Joaquin, or the giant flaming bird?

BOBBY It says here that the ashes of a Phoenix can burn the mother.

SAM The mother?

DEAN Great. Where do we get one?

BOBBY You got me. I thought it was a myth.

SAM All right, great. Well, let's see if we can find something out about a Phoenix.

(they look through books again)

DEAN Guys.Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, check this out. (Dean joins Bobby and Sam at the table and begins to read from the book he's holding) "March 5, 1861. Sunrise, Wyoming. Gun killed a Phoenix today. Left a pile of smoldering ash."

SAM Really? Whose gun?

DEAN Colt's.

SAM Colt? Colt like --

DEAN like the Colt. From...(Dean holds up the book, grinning)...Samuel Colt's Journal.

SAM What?! (Sam grins) That's his?

DEAN Yeah.

SAM Dude, no.

DEAN Dude, yes.

SAM (grabs for the book)Well, let me see it.

DEAN Get your own.

BOBBY Well, what else did he say about the Phoenix? What does it look like? Has it got feathers?

DEAN It just says "Phoenix."

BOBBY Did he say where he tracked it?

DEAN No.

SAM All right, so I guess we got to find one of our own, whatever it is.

DEAN I know where we can find one. March 5, 1861. Sunrise, Wyoming. We'll "Star Trek IV" this bitch.

(Sam shrugs)

BOBBY I only watched "Deep Space Nine."

DEAN It's like I don't even know you guys anymore. "Star Trek IV." Save the whales.

(Sam and Bobby both shrug)

DEAN We hop back in time, we join up with Samuel Colt, we hunt the Phoenix, and then we haul the ashes back home with us.

BOBBY Time travel?

DEAN Yeah.

BOBBY That's a reasonable plan?

DEAN We got a guy who can swing it. (Dean stands up, and prays) Castiel. The, uh, fate of the world is in the balance. So, come on down here. Come on, Cas, "I Dream of Jeannie" your ass down here pronto. Please.

(an angel appears in the vessel of a blonde woman)

DEAN Jeannie?

RACHEL Rachel. I understand you need some assistance? How can I help you?

DEAN Well, uh, we kind of need to talk to the Big Kahuna.

RACHEL I'm here on Castiel's behalf.

SAM Where is he?

RACHEL Busy.

DEAN Busy?

RACHEL Yes.

DEAN Well, we've got a line on the mother of freaking everything, so --

RACHEL I'm sure your issue's very important. But Castiel is currently commanding an army, so --

DEAN So we get stuck with Miss Moneypenny.

RACHEL So you need to learn your place.

DEAN Look, I don't know who you think you are --

RACHEL I'm his friend.

SAM What, you think we're not?

RACHEL I think you call him when you need something. We're fighting a war.

SAM We get that.

RACHEL Clearly you don't, or you wouldn't call him every time you stub your toe, you petty, entitled little pie--

CASTIEL Rachel. That's enough.

RACHEL I told you I'd take care of this.

CASTIEL It's all right. You can go.

RACHEL You're staying?

CASTIEL Go. I'll come when I can.

DEAN Wow. Friend of yours?

CASTIEL Yes. She's, uh, my lieutenant. She's...committed to the cause. Now, what do you need?

INT.BOBBY'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM

BOBBY Where the hell's Dean?

SAM Supply run, he said. I don't know.

CASTIEL Um, about your plan. You'll only have 24 hours.

SAM Wait, what? Why?

CASTIEL Well, the answer to your question can best be expressed as a series of partial differential equations.

BOBBY Yeah, aim lower.

CASTIEL The further back I send you, the harder it becomes to retrieve you. 24 hours is all I can risk. If I don't pull you home within that time, you'll be lost to me.

DEAN (enters the room carrying several large shopping bags) Well, then we better get you a watch.

BOBBY What the hell's all that?

DEAN We are going native. Got to blend in. (Dean hands Sam one of the bags - it is from 'Wally's Western World')

SAM Uh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

DEAN Sam.

SAM Dean, I can -- I can wear this. (Sam gestures at his current outfit)

DEAN And look like a spaceman?

SAM Look, just because you're obsessed with all that Wild West stuff --

DEAN No, I'm not.

SAM You have a fetish.

DEAN Shut up. I like old movies.

SAM You can recite every Clint Eastwood movie ever made, line for line.

BOBBY Even the monkey movies?

SAM Yeah. Especially the monkey movies.

DEAN His name is Clyde. At least wear the damn shirt.

(Sam comes downstairs wearing a white shirt embroidered with yellow roses. Dean is wearing a whole outfit, complete with sarape)

SAM Dean, this is stupid. I look stupid.

BOBBY You going to a hoedown?

CASTIEL Now, is it -- is it customary to wear a blanket?

DEAN It's a sarape. And, yes. It's, uh... Never mind. Let's just go. (looking at the gold watches and chains in his bag) What's this?

BOBBY Where you're goin', they don't take plastic.

CASTIEL I'll send you back to March 4th. That should give you time to find the Colt... and this Phoenix creature.

DEAN All right, well, see ya at High Noon tomorrow. ( Clicks tongue )

(Castiel touches them on the forehead and Sam and Dean appear in Sunrise, Wyoming 1861.)

EXT. SUNRISE, WYOMING 

DEAN Oh, now we're talking.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

CASTIEL I have to go.

BOBBY What about getting the boys back?

CASTIEL Pray for me in 24 hours, and I'll return.

BOBBY I'll pray for all of us.

(Bobby sets a timer to 24 hours)

EXT. SUNRISE, WYOMING 

DEAN All right. Let's go find Samuel Colt.

(Sam sets the timer on his watch to 24 hours)

DEAN Hey, we should try the Saloon first, uh, see what we get from the locals.

SAM Sure. (chuckles) Whatever, Sundance.

DEAN Think we'll have time to hit on saloon girls?

(Sam gives Dean a look)

DEAN I'm kidding. Come on.

SAM (takes a step right into a pile of horse manure) Oh, damn it. Come on.

DEAN You know what that is?

SAM Yeah, it's horse --

DEAN Authenticity!

SAM (Groans)

(The boys walk into the center of town and see a hanging taking place)

JUDGE MORTIMER We stand here today -- March 4th, 1861 -- to execute justice upon Elias Finch for the murder of his own wife.

SAM Wow. Talk about authenticity.

JUDGE MORTIMER Sentence handed down by myself, Tye Mortimer, duly appointed judge of the Wyoming circuit. You will be hung by your neck until you die.

SHERIFF You got anything to say?

ELIAS FINCH You're gonna burn for this. Every one of you.

(Elias is hanged. His bones crack and the crowd gasps)

DEAN Good times. So where do we find Sammy Colt?

SAM No idea. Huh. (watching the judge and sheriff walk down the steps of the hanging platform) I think I know who to ask, though.

MAN (turning around, he stares at Dean's attire) Nice blanket.

(Dean, disappointed, takes off his sarape. Sam and Dean enter the jail to find the sheriff.)

INT. JAIL

DEAN Sheriff? Can we have a word?

SHERIFF Depends who's askin'.

DEAN Marshal Eastwood. Clint Eastwood.

("The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" theme plays)

DEAN This here is, uh, Walker. (gesturing to Sam) He's a Texas Ranger.

SHERIFF So, what can I do for you boys?

SAM Uh, we're looking for a man.

JUDGE MORTIMER I'll bet. (gesturing to Dean) Nice shirt, there.

DEAN What's wrong with my shirt?

JUDGE MORTIMER You're very clean.

DEAN It's dirtier than it looks.

SAM We need to find Samuel Colt. Do you know him?

SHERIFF The gun maker?

DEAN Yeah. Is he in town?

SHERIFF Not that I know of. Might try asking Elkins over at the Saloon. Been here longer than God.

(Dean tips his hat, and he and Sam leave. They head into the saloon.)

INT. SALOON

DEAN (surveying the saloon) This is not awesome.

(Sam gives Dean an encouraging pat on the shoulder)

SAM Hi.

ELKINS What'll you have?

DEAN Oh, uh, okay. Great. I'll have your top-shelf whiskey.

ELKINS Only have the one shelf.

DEAN That'll do just fine. (pointing to Sam) And he'll have a sarsaparilla.

SAM You Elkins?

ELKINS One and only.

DEAN You know a man named Samuel Colt?

ELKINS He passed through here about four years ago.

SAM He still around?

ELKINS Rumor is, he's building a railroad stop 20 miles out of town, just by the Postal road. Middle of nowhere.

SAM (whispering) The Devil's Gate?

DEAN Location fits.

DARLA Howdy, boys.

ELKINS Darla's my best girl.

DARLA Try me. You want a kiss?

DEAN S-so much more germier than I pictured.

JUDGE MORTIMER Darla!

DARLA Ah. Judge. Nice to see you.

JUDGE MORTIMER I thought we had a date.

DEAN Wow, that was a close one. 

SAM I guess it's good to be judge.

DEAN Yeah. (drinks from his whiskey, spits it out) Ohh. It's like gasoline.

SAM Sarsaparilla ain't half bad.

INT. SALOON -DARLA'S ROOM

(Darla and Mortimer are on the bed. Darla sees something, gasps, and pushes away. She scrambles away from the bed. Downstairs, Sam and Dean hear Darla's scream. They run upstairs. In Darla's room, Elias appears and puts his hand on Mortimer. Mortimer screams and burns. Sam and Dean enter and find Darla in the corner, on the bed there is only a smoldering skeleton, half turned to ash. )

ACT II
SAM You okay, Sheriff?

SHERIFF 'Course I'm okay.

DARLA It was a ghost!

SHERIFF It wasn't a ghost. Unless ghosts leave footprints. (gesturing at the floor where there are dark footprints leading out of the room)

DARLA I am telling you, Elias Finch was here. He did... that, and then he walked out that door.

SHERIFF Rope didn't kill him. Seen it before.

SAM Well, you got any idea where he could be?

SHERIFF Could be a thousand places.

DEAN Well, you got a way to flush him out?

SHERIFF 'Course. We're gonna form a posse. Then we're gonna string Finch up right. Put a bullet in his head for good measure.

DEAN That actually sounds like a good plan.

SHERIFF You two should come along. Meet downstairs at dawn.

DEAN Yeah, we'll be there.

SHERIFF Get yourselves some real gear first, huh?

DEAN Well, I think we ought to pay our respects to Finch.

SAM I was thinking the same thing.

EXT. CEMETERY -NIGHT

SAM You thinking what I'm thinking?

DEAN Rose from the ashes, burned up its victim? You know, maybe we're not looking for a flaming bird. Maybe the Phoenix is actually walking around in cowboy boots.

SAM That makes sense, right? Could be Finch. So, question is, how do we put this thing out?

DEAN Well, we do know one thing that'll kill friggin' anything, right?

SAM Yeah, the Colt.

DEAN So, you go get the gun.

SAM But isn't the gun coming here? I mean, according to Samuel Colt's journal?

DEAN Yeah, but people here barely even know who Colt is. Maybe you got to go find him and make history.

DEAN I'll stay here, hook up with the posse. 'Cause you know me -- I'm a posse magnet. I mean, I love posse. Make that into a t-shirt.

SAM You done? Look, the problem is, Colt's 20 miles outside of town. How am I supposed to get there and back before noon?

(they hear a horse in the distance)

DEAN Ride 'em, cowboy.

(they buy a horse)

DEAN Wh-- uh, try -- try the other side. Yeah, good boy.

SAM Right. (Sam gets onto the horse and rides away slowly) Yeah. Right. Hey. This actually feels all right.

DEAN All right, take it -- just take it easy.

SAM Yeah, you bet. I'm good. All right, 11:00 A.M., right?

DEAN Don't be late!

SAM Okay.

DEAN All right. Go on. Go. Hyah!

SAM I'm okay!

DEAN That poor horse.

(Sam gallops off)

(the sheriff goes to his horse, Elias watches him. The horse is startled, and runs off. The sheriff sees Elias and shoots him, to no effect)

SHERIFF Forgive me! I'm sorry!

ELIAS You had your chance. Tell it to the judge.

(Elias burns the sheriff, the sheriff screams and dies)

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

RACHEL We need to talk.

CASTIEL You summoned me here?

RACHEL Castiel, I've been hearing things. Things I don't want to believe. Just tell me if it's true.

CASTIEL If what's true?

RACHEL You know. Your dirty little secret.

CASTIEL I have to defeat Raphael.

RACHEL Not this way, Castiel.

CASTIEL Rachel.

RACHEL We put our faith in you, and...look what you're turning into.

CASTIEL I don't have a choice.

RACHEL Then neither do I. (Rachel stabs Castiel with her blade)

(They fight, Castiel turns Rachel's blade on her and stabs her. He lowers her to the ground and watches her die.)

CASTIEL I'm sorry.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

(Castiel appears in Bobby's kitchen, bleeding.)

BOBBY What the hell is going on?! Cas?

(Castiel draws a sigil on the kitchen cabinet.)

BOBBY Cas? Are we running or fighting?

CASTIEL We're...(he collapses into Bobby's arms)

BOBBY Balls.

INT. SALOON - DAY

ELKINS New hat.

DEAN I look good. Where's the posse? I must be early.

ELKINS Or you're the only greenhorn dumb enough to go chasing after a ghost.

DEAN What are you talking about? Sheriff's tough as nails. He'll be here.

MAN (from outside the saloon) Oh, God! The Sheriff's dead!

DEAN Or not. 

EXT. OUTSIDE SALOON

(Dean looks at the pile of ash and bones with the sheriff's badge on top) 

DEAN Great. Who's the Sheriff now?

(Elkins pins the badge on Dean)

DEAN What. What...

ELKINS Now...Congratulations, Sheriff.

ACT III
INT. SAMUEL COLT'S HOUSE

(Samuel Colt sits at his desk drinking.) SAMUEL COLT Ahh.

(Two men enter.)

MAN Samuel Colt?

SAMUEL COLT You have the wrong drunk, gentlemen. Have a nice day.

MAN We've been looking for you, Colt.

SAMUEL COLT And who might "we" be?

(The two men's eyes flash black. they are both demons.)

SAMUEL COLT Listen...I've long since hung it up. I'm tired, and I'm too damn old for this, and I'm sure as hell not looking for any trouble.

DEMON Well, it's found you anyway. We know you built that Devil's gate, Colt. So you're gonna open it for us. That is, if you fancy keeping your lungs in your chest.

SAMUEL COLT Walk away, gentlemen.

DEMON Well, I think we'd rather rip you to ribbons, you soft --

SAMUEL COLT (pulls out his colt and shoots the two demons. They fall to the floor and die. Samuel peers over his desk at the shattered bottle of whiskey on the floor) ah, that's a shame. A damn shame.

INT. HOUSE - DEPUTY'S ROOM

(the deputy is packing his suitcase- he hears a knock)

DEPUTY Who's there?

DEAN (in a high pitched voice) Candygram for Mongo.

(Deputy opens the door)

DEAN Howdy, pilgrim.

DEPUTY I ain't no pilgrim.

DEAN All right, back up. (gesturing at the deputy's gun, Dean shows the deputy his new sheriff's badge) Is that any way to, uh... Greet your new boss?

DEPUTY (Scoffs)

DEAN Missed you at the posse this morning. I was a one-man wolf pack, thanks to you. (looking at the deputy's suitcase) What's going on here?

DEPUTY Going to visit my sister.

DEAN Well, she'll have to wait.

DEPUTY But if I don't --

DEAN Finch said he was coming back for the former Sheriff...Judge Mortimer... and you. That's two down and one to go.

DEPUTY Then just let me go!

DEAN You really think you can outrun him? He is going to kill you. Unless...

DEPUTY Unless what?

DEAN Unless we gank him first.

DEPUTY "Gank"? What's "gank"? Mister, you're crazy. No way. You're on your own.

DEAN I'm not asking you to throw down with him. I'm asking you to play your part.

DEPUTY My part?

DEAN Yeah. Bait.

INT. SAMUEL COLT'S HOUSE

(Sam opens Samuel's door and peers inside)

SAM Hello?

(Samuel throws holy water on Sam)

SAM Okay, not a demon! Not a demon! Just -- just a hunter. Sheesh.

SAMUEL COLT You're what?

SAM You Samuel Colt? My name is Sam Winchester. I'm -- I'm a hunter from the year 2011.

SAMUEL COLT Prove it.

(Sam hands Samuel his blackberry. Samuel looks at it and heads back to his desk)

SAMUEL COLT All right. (he places Sam's blackberry behind his desk on the bookshelf)

SAM A-all right? That's -- uh, that's it?

SAMUEL COLT Well, when you've done this job as long as I have...a giant from the future with some magic brick doesn't exactly give you the vapors.

SAM I need your help killing a Phoenix.

SAMUEL COLT A Phoenix? They exist?

SAM Well, you shoot one in about three hours.

SAMUEL COLT If you say so.

SAM I don't. You do. (Sam hands Samuel Colt's journal to Samuel Colt)

SAMUEL COLT (looks at his two journals lying on top of each other) That's...I'm either too drunk or not drunk enough. So what is it I'm about to exactly do?

SAM Well, the Phoenix is in Sunrise, so, uh, if we leave now, you can --

SAMUEL COLT I appreciate your situation, but I'm not gonna be of any help to you. I'm booked.

SAM Right, but -- but you say right here --

SAMUEL COLT Don't believe everything that you read.

SAM But you're a hunter.

SAMUEL COLT Retired.

SAM There's no such thing.

SAMUEL COLT I'm out.

SAM There is no getting out. Look, for what it's worth, in my time, you're a hero.

SAMUEL COLT Me?

SAM Yes, sir.

SAMUEL COLT (Laughs)

SAM Now, look, we -- we need to kill this Phoenix. Its ashes are the only thing that can kill the monster I'm hunting. So stow your crap for a few hours, and let's go. We got to go now. So, either you're coming with me, or I need the gun.

SAMUEL COLT What gun?

SAM The gun.

SAMUEL COLT Oh, that gun. I lost it in a game of Stud.

SAM You're lying.

SAMUEL COLT Am I? (Laughs) Now, that doesn't sound like me.

SAM You shot a couple of demons with it less than an hour ago.

SAMUEL COLT How do you figure?

SAM (Breathes deeply and points towards the door) Two pairs of bootprints. Cabin reeks of sulfur.

SAMUEL COLT (nods) Not bad. (Samuel opens his jacket so Sam can see the colt in his holster) You don't want it. It's a curse. Believe me.

SAM Great. Then let me take it off your hands.

SAMUEL COLT You go put on a few more miles and come back, and we'll talk.

SAM Trust me, I've got plenty of mileage.

SAMUEL COLT I'm doing you a favor. Believe me.

SAM So, what? You can really just sit there?

SAMUEL COLT I've given my whole life to this. I'm done.

SAM So it doesn't matter what happens.

SAMUEL COLT No, it doesn't.

SAM So everything you did, it all means nothing? Give me the gun.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE

(Bobby's timer shows one hour left)

CASTIEL (sits up and exhales sharply)

BOBBY Cas, you -- you look like you went 12 rounds with truckasaurus. What happened?

CASTIEL I was, uh...I was betrayed. Rachel, uh...Raphael...He corrupted her. She turned on me.

BOBBY Sorry. Girl's a real... peach.

CASTIEL She's... dead. I... was wounded. I needed... safety. Thank you. (He tries to get up from the couch, coughs and grunts, Bobby pushes him back down)

BOBBY Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. What's with the finger painting?

CASTIEL It's a warding symbol against angels.

BOBBY How bad's it hurt?

CASTIEL I'll heal.

BOBBY Well, good...'Cause we got less than an hour before you pick up the kids at Frontierland.

CASTIEL I can't.

BOBBY Come again?

CASTIEL This fight...Drained me.

BOBBY Well, if you're up on blocks, then call in another halo who can get the job done.

CASTIEL I can't.

BOBBY Well, there's got to be something that can juice you up. A spell -- something.

CASTIEL There is one thing that might work, but...It's extremely dangerous.

BOBBY Shocker. So, lay it on me.

CASTIEL It's your soul.

BOBBY What do you want me to do? Make another deal? Seal it with a kiss?

CASTIEL I need you to let me touch it.

BOBBY Touch it?

CASTIEL The human soul -- it's pure... energy. If I can siphon some of that off, I-I might be able to bring Sam and Dean back.

BOBBY And the catch is...?

CASTIEL Doing this is like...putting your hand in a nuclear reactor. I have to do it very gingerly.

BOBBY Or...?

CASTIEL Or you'll explode.

BOBBY Well. Keep both hands on the wheel. Let's do this.

ACT IV
INT. JAIL

(Dean glances at the clock nervously) DEAN Never been late in your damn life, Sam, and now you're dragging ass.

DEPUTY (from the jail cell) So this is your big plan, huh? Just let me rot in here till Finch comes?

DEAN Pretty much. Why's he gunning for you, anyway?

DEPUTY I guess you missed the part where we hung him?

DEAN No, I'm thinking to a thing like Finch, that's no big whoop. He would've just blown town, but he came back. That seems personal.

DEPUTY I'll tell you what -- you let me out of here, and we'll talk.

DEAN (Clicks tongue) No can do.

(Elias Finch enters)

ELIAS Open up that cell.

DEAN Open it yourself. You melt people's faces off. I'll bet you got the juice to tear that apart easy, don't you? Unless you can't. Just like you couldn't break those cuffs when they strung you up.

(Dean throws the iron nail he's holding at Elias, who catches it by reflex)

ELIAS Aah. (he drops the nail and his hand smolders)

DEAN Iron shackles...iron bars, iron nail. See a pattern? Don't worry. Most creatures I meet can't get it up for iron. It's a common monster problem.

ELIAS So you're a hunter.

DEAN Slash sheriff.

ELIAS You know what this son of a bitch did?

DEAN Do tell.

ELIAS I was married to a woman. Good woman -- human. We lived outside of town, didn't bother anyone.

DEAN Sure, freak with a heart of gold.

ELIAS You want to call me "monster," fine. But all we did was go into town. I go into the bank for five minutes. I come out, she's gone. And then I heard her scream. (Exhales sharply) This... man had her pinned in the alley. I go to stop him, he pulls his gun, shoots me, then her. She died in my arms. 'Course, I don't die. The shots brought the Sheriff. Next thing I know, I'm in iron. That's why I want him just where he is -- trapped, scared. I saved the best for last.

DEAN (to the deputy)Is that true?

ELIAS So tell me -- are you really willing to die to protect this piece of filth?

DEAN Honestly, I could care less about him. He's a dick and a coward.

DEPUTY Hey!

DEAN But this ain't about him. I know what you are.

ELIAS Really?

DEAN Yeah. So...I got to kill you.

ELIAS Well, if you know what I am, then you know you can't.

(Elias grabs the deputy's gun from where his holster hangs on the wall and shoots the deputy)

DEAN Wow, I should've seen that coming.

(Dean jumps through the window and runs from Elias, who is firing at him)

EXT. SUNRISE, WYOMING

(Dean runs and hides from Elias.)

SAM Dean!

DEAN Sam, come on, come on!

DEAN Hey, where's Colt?

SAM He's not coming.

DEAN What?!

SAM But he sent this. (Sam hands Dean the colt)

DEAN Ohh. Hello, beautiful.

SAM All right.

DEAN Come on.

SAM Yeah.

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

(the timer shows two minutes left)

CASTIEL Are you sure?

BOBBY Well, we can't just strand those idjits in Deadwood, can we?

CASTIEL The risks...

BOBBY Just... don't explode me.

EXT. SUNRISE, WYOMING

DEAN (walking onto the main road) Get out here, Finch!

SAM (from nearby, around the corner) What are you doing?!

DEAN Come on! Let's do this!

ELIAS So, this is how you want to die. Fine.

(Elias walks to the road and faces Dean)

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

(Castiel sticks his arm inside of Bobby and siphons off some energy from Bobby's soul. Bobby screams. There is a minute left on the timer.)

EXT. SUNRISE, WYOMING

(Dean and Elias wait for the clock to strike twelve and shoot. Dean hits Elias, and Elias dies, shocked. He bursts into flame and leaves behind a pile of ashes.)

DEAN Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

(Castiel's eyes light up)

EXT. SUNRISE, WYOMING

SAM (notices the clock shows noon) Dean! The ashes!

(Sam and Dean run towards the ashes)

INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

(Sam and Dean appear in Bobby's house, Dean's bottle is empty- he did not gather any ashes)

FINAL ACT
INT. BOBBY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

DEAN (to Castiel) You gotta send us back.

SAM Dean, look at him. He's fried.

CASTIEL I never want to do that again.

DEAN Bobby, you --

BOBBY I'm still kickin', Annie Oakley. Be back good as new in...A decade or two.

DEAN And we screwed the pooch. Bobby, I'm sorry.

(there is a knock on the door. Sam goes to answer the door. There is a delivery man from "Western Couriers" holding a package.)

WESTERN COURIER DELIVERY MAN Is there a Sam Winchester here?

SAM Who's asking?

WESTERN COURIER DELIVERY MAN Look, this is nuts -- me and a couple guys made a bet. So... this thing's been laying around the office since...ever!? Uh, with a note on it saying to bring it here today. It's from a-a Samuel Colt?

SAM Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's -- that's mine. Great. Thanks. (Sam grabs the package and closes the door.) Thanks.

WESTERN COURIER DELIVERY MAN Yeah.

(Sam opens the package and reads the letter inside.)

SAM "Dear Sam, I got this address and date off your thingamajig, and I thought the enclosed might come in handy. Regards, Samuel Colt." (Sam pulls a bottle full of ashes from the package.)

BOBBY Is that what I think it is?

DEAN Ashes of a Phoenix. You know what this means?

BOBBY Yeah, I didn't get a "soulonoscopy" for nothing.

DEAN Yes. And... it means we take the fight to her.
