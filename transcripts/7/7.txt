NOW
INT. HOUSE – NIGHT

A MEDIUM, a MAN and a WOMAN hold hands around a Ouija board.

MEDIUM:
Yes. A spirit has gathered around us. Are you with us, spirit?

The MAN rolls his eyes. The curtains move and the WOMAN smiles.

WOMAN:
I feel something. I have goose bumps. Uncle Danny?

MEDIUM:
We're going to make contact now. Rest your hands on the planchette.

The MEDIUM and the WOMAN place their fingers on the planchette in the middle of the Ouija board.

MEDIUM:
Let the spirit guide our hands.

The MEDIUM closes her eyes and tilts her head upwards.

MEDIUM:
O spirit, are you the one we seek? Are you... Uncle Danny?

The planchette moves towards “Yes” on the Ouija board.

WOMAN:
I'm not doing that.

MAN:
Yeah. She's pushing it.

The MEDIUM takes her hands away from the Ouija board and the WOMAN follows suit.

MEDIUM:
It's okay to be skeptical.

MEDIUM:
Danny, if you're with us, knock twice for yes.

There are two knocks. The WOMAN smiles happily.

WOMAN:
Danny? Can you ask him, is he happy?

The MEDIUM closes her eyes and tilts her head upwards again.

There are two knocks.

MEDIUM:
He is. He's happy.

WOMAN:
Is Sadie with him?

MAN:
Now you're being ridiculous, Cynthia. Who cares about Sadie?

The MEDIUM raises her hands to her eyes.

MEDIUM:
Ah, yes. I see... A family pet.

CYNTHIA:
That's her. Sadie was a Schnauzer.

MEDIUM:
She's with Danny, chasing tennis balls in the afterlife.

CYNTHIA:
Sadie loved tennis balls.

MAN:
There were important papers. No one can find them. They weren't in the safe. Can you just ask him...

MEDIUM:
Of course. I'll need you to place your hands with me on the planchette.

The MAN reaches out for the planchette, but as he does so the lights flicker and electricity crackles.

MEDIUM:
Maybe – maybe Danny didn't like the question.

MAN:
Tell him to quit fooling around. He knows darn well that's my money.

The fire in the fireplace roars, then dies out.

CYNTHIA:
Can't you two stop squabbling? For Pete's sake, he's dead. Tell him we're sorry. Maybe if we're nice, he'll –

The planchette starts to move.

CYNTHIA:
Oh, my God. Danny?

The planchette darts across the board to "No". When the MEDIUM and WOMAN exhale, their breath is visible. The MEDIUM stands up.

CYNTHIA:
What's going on?

The planchette rises into the air, turns, and stabs the MEDIUM in the throat. Blood splatters the MAN. He and CYNTHIA gasp and scream as the MEDIUM falls dead on the floor.

SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)

ACT ONE
EXT. STREET – DAY

DEAN is walking along a street carrying a bag from Fat Mack’s Bar-B-Q Rib Shack. He checks his cell phone, which says NO MESSAGES. He stops next to a blue and gray Dodge Challenger, looks around, then uses a hook to break in. He looks in disgust at a pile of garbage on the passenger seat.

DEAN:
Geez. Have some pride.

DEAN sweeps the garbage onto the floor and hot-wires the car.

DEAN:
Yeah.

RADIO:
Ooh! That make me hungry. You're listening to...

DEAN pulls down fluffy dice that were hanging from the rear-vision mirror.

RADIO:
... the morning chaos with me, Bananas Foster.

DEAN:
The hell I am, ass-hat.

DEAN moves to change the channel, but then pauses.

RADIO:
And now for the news of the weird – two very odd murders, to be exact. Mediums are dying in Lily Dale, the most psychic town in America. So if you want to know your future...

DEAN reverses out of the parking spot and drives off.

RADIO:
...stick to that 900 line, 'cause is it me, or should those guys have seen it coming?

EXT. LILY DALE, NEW YORK – DAY

INT. MEDIUM’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN shows his badge to a police officer and looks around the room where the séance was held. He discovers a tape recorder under the table and plays the recording, which is of rustling noises. He moves a lever on the floor and there are mumbled voices. He presses a switch on a chair and the curtains move.

DEAN:
O spirits of the further... am I going to win the Powerball?

DEAN presses a large lever under the table and there is a knock.

DEAN:
I'm gonna be rich!

EXT. STREET – DAY

Shop signs advertise psychic, palm and tarot readings. DEAN walks along the street. He stops at a poster for the Annual Lily Dale Psychic Festival featuring Imelda Graven (Crystal Ball), Grandma Goldy (Talking Board) and Nikolai Lishin (Kinetic Mind). He enters the Good Graces Cafe. A blackboard at the back says “Special of the Day: You!” and “Soup of the Day: A State of Bliss”.

WAITER:
Hello! First time at Good Graces?

DEAN:
Yes.

WAITER:
Well, we're 100% locally sourced, biodynamic, and you get a free affirmation with every order.

DEAN:
Think I'll source a taco joint.

WAITER:
All right.

DEAN turns to leave, but hears SAM’s voice.

SAM:
Just coffee, black, extra shot.

SAM is sitting at a table, reading a case file.

DEAN:
You always wear a suit to get your palm read?

SAM doesn’t reply or smile.

DEAN:
Yeah. Not surprised you caught this one. It's on every morning zoo in America. You mind?

SAM moves his hands noncommittally. DEAN takes a seat across the table. SAM moves his case file to his lap.

DEAN:
So, I, uh, I went to the scene. Wires, speakers, enough E.M.F. to make your hair stand up. Don't even think about getting a reading. Oh, and, uh, if this hadn't have been two psychics that bit it... I would have just chalked this up as being, uh, dumb and accidental. And I know, I know. This whole town's supposedly calling ghosts. But that takes some serious spellwork and some serious mojo. The only books this lady had were Oprah crap. When was the last time you actually saw a real psychic? Huh? Pamela? Missouri? Anyway, this [DEAN gestures towards SAM] is good. And, uh, how you been?

WAITER:
And what can I get for you?

DEAN:
Uh, pancakes, side of pig. Coffee, black.

WAITER:
Fantastic. You are a virile manifestation of the divine.

The WAITER smiles broadly and leaves.

DEAN:
What the hell did he say to me?

SAM scoffs, shakes his head and looks away.

DEAN:
Oh, it's funny? Yeah, no. Go ahead. Laugh it up, Sam. Hilarious.

SAM:
Dean...

DEAN:
Oh, he speaks.

SAM:
Look...

DEAN:
Sam. Look, we're both here. All right, the chance of either one of us leaving while people are still dying out there—

DEAN makes a “zero” sign with his hand and clicks his tongue.

DEAN:
You might as well bite the bullet and work with me on this one.

SAM:
I don't know if I can.

DEAN:
I'm not asking you to open up a can of worms, okay, I'm not even asking you where the hell you've been for the past week and a half.

SAM:
Good.

DEAN:
I'm just saying, let's try and stop the killings. That's it.

SAM:
Okay.

DEAN:
Okay? Good.

A WOMAN stops at their table and stares at SAM and DEAN.

DEAN:
Can I help you?

WOMAN:
You're the brothers from the—

SAM:
Oh, no, no, no, no. The Winchester guys on the news a couple weeks back? No – we get that a lot.

DEAN:
Yeah, no. Those depraved killers got put down like the dogs that they were. Us on the other hand, we're completely harmless.

The WOMAN laughs.

WOMAN:
Oh, yeah! I'm sorry. Silly me. And I can see by your energies, you're completely gentle.

A MAN walks up and puts his arm around the WOMAN.

MAN:
Excuse my friend. She's excitable. Sweetheart, look at them, hmm? They're FBI.

WOMAN:
Oh!

MAN:
I'm Russian. We can spot the law. You must be here about the tragedies.

WOMAN:
Oh, we're just beside ourselves about what happened.

DEAN:
Yeah. And so close to festival season, huh?

WOMAN:
Yeah – no—

MAN:
Of course we are worried. We have no idea what's going on, huh?

The MAN takes out a business card and hands it to SAM.

MAN:
Nikolai. Let me know if I can help you. I'm highly intuitive.

SAM:
Nikolai Lishin, spoon bender?

NIKOLAI:
Mm. World famous.

NIKOLAI picks up SAM’s spoon.

NIKOLAI:
Come to my demonstration at the festival, huh?

NIKOLAI makes a hand motion over the spoon and grunts.

NIKOLAI:
I teach you to harness the power of your mind.

NIKOLAI puts down the spoon.

NIKOLAI:
Come, let's leave them be.

NIKOLAI and the WOMAN walk to their table.

DEAN:
So glad we decided to vacation here, huh? Right?

SAM puts his case file back on the table.

SAM:
All right. Here we go. First death... second death.

SAM slides the file over to DEAN. It is open at a photograph.

DEAN:
What am I looking at?

SAM:
Well, see this? Now, this is Imelda Graven, death number one. She was brained by her own crystal ball.

DEAN:
Bummer, and ironic.

DEAN turns over a page. The next photograph is of the MEDIUM who was stabbed by the planchette. DEAN looks back at the first photograph.

DEAN:
Same necklace?

SAM:
Yeah. See, Imelda gave it to Goldy in her will.

DEAN:
Okay, so, cursed object, maybe?

SAM:
Worth looking into. Goldy's next of kin lives in town, also a psychic.

DEAN:
Oh, good. I haven't had my fill.

SAM pours sugar into his coffee. The spoon in his other hand bends.

SAM:
He broke my spoon.

EXT. HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and SAM walk towards the front door. The door opens and two women come out.

DEAN:
Melanie Golden? Hi. Uh...Got a minute?

DEAN and SAM hold up FBI badges.

MELANIE'S FRIEND:
You want me to stay?

MELANIE:
No, that's okay.

MELANIE'S FRIEND:
Okay.

MELANIE embraces MELANIE'S FRIEND.

MELANIE:
Thanks for stopping by, hon.

MELANIE'S FRIEND:
Of course.

MELANIE'S FRIEND leaves.

MELANIE:
A friend. She just heard about my grandmother... which is, I guess, why you guys are here, so come on in.

INT. MELANIE GOLDEN’S HOUSE – DAY

MELANIE:
Sorry. I just got back.

DEAN:
You were out of town?

MELANIE:
Yeah, I work the circuit – hotels, conventions, you know.

DEAN:
Oh. Wait. No offense, but... you don't seem all that psychic.

MELANIE:
Why do you say that?

DEAN:
Well, I mean, just, you know, where's all the... crystals and pyramids?

MELANIE:
I'm off the clock. Also not psychic. What? It's an honest living.

DEAN:
Interesting definition of "honest."

MELANIE:
Well, I honestly read people. It's just less whoo-whoo, more body language. Like you two – long-time partners, but, um... a lot of tension. [Gestures to SAM.] You're pissed. [Gestures to DEAN.] And you're stressed. It's not brain surgery. It's kind of why my grandma and me didn't get along. I mean, she'd go full smoke-machine, but she still actually believed in all that stuff, so...

DEAN:
You don't?

MELANIE:
You do?

DEAN:
I've got an open mind. You'd be surprised.

MELANIE:
Hmm.

SAM:
I'm sorry to have to ask, b-but there's a necklace of your grandmother's.

MELANIE:
Don't have it. Everything went straight to the emporium. She had a deal with the owner.

SAM:
The emporium?

INT. EMPORIUM – DAY

DEAN and SAM walk up to the counter. The MAN behind the counter puts down his coffee.

MAN:
Mmm. Mmm. You're looking... for something.

DEAN:
You're good.

SAM:
You Jimmy Tomorrow?

JIMMY:
Mm-hmm.

SAM:
We're looking for a necklace.

JIMMY:
Oh. Romantic.

SAM:
It would have come in with Grandma Goldy's effects.

SAM puts a photo of Imelda Goldy on the counter and points to the necklace she is wearing.

JIMMY:
Oh. Yes, yes. Now, you do know that this is the Orb of Thessaly.

DEAN:
We did not know.

JIMMY picks up a large metal box and puts it on the counter.

JIMMY:
Very powerful, very rare.

DEAN:
Let me guess. Very expensive.

JIMMY:
Worth every penny.

JIMMY takes out the necklace.

DEAN:
Well, in that case...

DEAN and SAM hold up their FBI badges.

DEAN:
...we'll be taking the state's-evidence discount.

JIMMY:
What's going on?

SAM:
A murder investigation that we'd like to personally thank you for not obstructing.

SAM reaches out to take the necklace. JIMMY grabs SAM’s wrist.

JIMMY:
You know, I give private energetic readings.

SAM:
No, thanks.

JIMMY:
A loss weighs on you. You're angry. It's complicated. Come see me, Agent.

JIMMY holds out his business card to SAM. It reads:

Jimmy Tomorrow

Private Readings

NO FUTURE TOO GRIM

809 1/2 Main Street

Lily Dale, N.Y. U.S.A. 14752

SAM takes the card with an annoyed look.

DEAN:
Thanks, Jimmy. We'll see you.

SAM and DEAN walk away. JIMMY calls after them.

JIMMY:
The bureau's gonna reimburse me for the necklace, right?

DEAN:
Oh, we'll send you a check.

JIMMY:
Right.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE EMPORIUM – DAY

SAM is examining the necklace.

DEAN:
Went a little "Mentalist" on you there, didn't he?

SAM glances at DEAN but doesn’t answer.

DEAN:
All right. Next question. What's an Orb of Thessaly?

SAM:
I know one thing – it's made in Taiwan.

SAM tosses the necklace to DEAN.

DEAN:
Oh, a fake, around here. Imagine that. 'Course, that means that whatever's killing mediums is still out there.

DEAN and SAM get into the Dodge.

INT. NIKOLAI LISHIN’S HOUSE – DAY

NIKOLAI sits on the couch with a beer and empties a bag of silverware onto the coffee table. He holds out his fingers and waves them, then picks up a fork, rubs it and forcibly bends it with his hands. It unbends. NIKOLAI looks surprised and concerned. The lights flicker, electricity crackles, voices murmur and there are clattering noises. NIKOLAI looks down at the coffee table in alarm: all of the silverware is standing straight up. He stands up and takes a few steps away from the table. When he exhales, his breath is visible. He is lifted off the ground by an invisible force and hovers above the coffee table, before dropping down onto it. He is impaled by the silverware.

ACT TWO
INT. NIKOLAI LISHIN’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and SAM look at the bloodstained coffee table and scattered silverware.

DEAN:
He probably should have bent those with the power of his mind.

SAM:
Chief. We met at the station.

POLICE CHIEF:
Right. Morning, Agent.

SAM:
Morning. Uh, this is Agent Borne. So, what happened?

POLICE CHIEF:
It's a weird one. Chest full of cutlery.

DEAN:
All right. We're gonna take a look around. Let us know if you get any leads.

POLICE CHIEF:
Oh, I got leads coming out of my ass. As of 9 o'clock, our tip line had 46 calls, all from clairvoyants that know what really happened.

DEAN:
What's the popular theory?

POLICE CHIEF:
It's a toss-up between a ghost and some sort of ogre that only attacks Russians.

DEAN:
Policing Lily Dale sounds fun.

POLICE CHIEF:
It was either this or Los Angeles.

SAM:
So, these clairvoyants, did they give any details as to why they thought it was a ghost? Or a... Russian ogre?

POLICE CHIEF:
Their spirit monkey said so. Plus, apparently, this guy claims he had a vision of his own death, cutlery and all.

DEAN’s phone rings.

DEAN:
Excuse me.

DEAN (on phone):
Hello?

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – DAY

MELANIE (on phone):
Agent Borne? It's Melanie Golden.

INT. NIKOLAI LISHIN’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN (on phone):
Everything okay?

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – DAY

MELANIE (on phone):
Did you mean it when you said you had an open mind?

INT. NIKOLAI LISHIN’S HOUSE – DAY

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – DAY

MELANIE is holding a landline phone.

MELANIE:
I hadn't checked it until today. I mean, the only person who ever called my landline was my grandma.

SAM:
That's okay. Go on.

MELANIE:
Look, I wouldn't put any stock in it. I mean, she was always calling me with some crazy dream she was sure was a sign, that kind of thing, but...uh, is it true Nikolai had a real vision of his death?

DEAN:
That's what we were told.

MELANIE:
Well, so did she – the day she died.

DEAN:
What'd she say?

MELANIE:
Well, you can listen to it if you want. She said she was in a séance, then the lights go, it's freezing.

SAM:
Wait, she said that? That the room got cold?

MELANIE:
Yeah. Why? Is that important?

SAM and DEAN look at each other.

MELANIE:
What? What is it?

DEAN:
A ghost. The real deal.

MELANIE:
Come on. You're serious.

DEAN:
Yeah. See, there's, uh, fake whoo-whoo crap, and there's real whoo-whoo crap.

MELANIE:
Well, yeah, but... ghosts?

DEAN:
Oh, trust me. There's a lot weirder out there than that.

MELANIE:
So "The X-files" is real, or you just stopped talking like an FBI agent.

SAM:
Well, um... we're not FBI agents.

MELANIE:
I need a drink.

DEAN:
I support that.

EXT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN:
You know, if this is a spirit, it ain't your average spook tied to a house. I mean, this thing is boogieing all over town.

SAM:
Not surprised.

The camera pans to two “psychic” signs outside nearby houses.

SAM:
I mean, how many crystal balls do you figure there are in Lily Dale?

DEAN:
Somewhere between 50 and, uh, all of them.

DEAN and SAM walk to the Dodge.

SAM:
Well, I mean, quartz can act as an antenna for spirits, right? I mean, that's why mediums started using crystal balls in the first place.

DEAN:
Well, that means that every storefront in town has got a ghost satellite dish.

SAM:
Exactly. And this place is packed with people summoning spirits.

DEAN:
Yeah, but, dude, most of these guys can't even call a taxi.

SAM:
All it takes is one.

DEAN:
That's gonna be like looking for a needle in a stack of fake needles.

SAM:
It's worse. I mean, I'll bet you anything some of these guys got real juice. I'm not talking kill-people level. I'm just saying, enough to make it complicated.

DEAN:
I hate this town. All right, so...

DEAN opens the driver’s door of the Dodge.

DEAN:
... what? Start hitting up the Miss Cleos?

SAM:
I was thinking split up and canvass. It's faster.

SAM walks away.

DEAN:
Right. 'Course you were.

INT. HOUSE – DAY

MELANIE’S FRIEND, dressed in costume, tips a container of bones onto a table, whispers over them and raises one to her forehead. She inhales deeply. A woman CUSTOMER is seated across from her.

CUSTOMER:
What is it? My brother? Is he going back to prison?

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
[In a dramatic voice] Stay away. His curse will drag you down. Folks do turn jail into a habit, you know?

The CUSTOMER looks disappointed and exasperated.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
[In a dramatic voice] Oh, no, no. Don't fret. I's always say, family... is a pain in the ass anyhow!

CUSTOMER:
Thank you, Sister Thibodeaux.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
[In a dramatic voice] No, child. Thank the spirits. Now, will that be cash or credit?

MELANIE’S FRIEND counts money and puts it in a metal box. She picks up the box and walks a few steps across the room. Her eyes turn white and she has a vision of fire, a cuckoo clock chiming 2 o'clock, and herself being strangled.

A doorbell rings. DEAN and MELANIE are outside. MELANIE’S FRIEND opens the door.

MELANIE:
It's okay. Like I said on the phone, he can help.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
[In a normal voice] Phony lawman, huh?

DEAN:
Yeah, 'cause nobody can relate to phony around here.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
Well, if you can do something, I don't care if you call yourself the Pope.

DEAN:
All right. What happened, exactly?

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
What happened is, I had a friggin' vision. Something is coming for me.

DEAN:
What's coming? Did you get a look?

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
No. But I sure felt it when it started breaking my bones. I don't want to die.

DEAN:
Okay. We'll figure it out. The vision happened in here?

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
Yeah, by the cash box.

DEAN notices a camera in a mask on the wall.

DEAN:
There any chance good-lookin' was watching?

DEAN, MELANIE and MELANIE’S FRIEND watch the video footage on a computer. It shows MELANIE’S FRIEND walking across the room with the cash box when the picture cuts out.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
What was that?

DEAN replays the footage. A ghost of a woman can be seen behind MELANIE’S FRIEND.

MELANIE’S FRIEND gasps.

MELANIE:
What the hell?!

The ghost on the video footage walks up behind MELANIE’S FRIEND and puts her hands on her head.

MELANIE:
Oh, my God.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
Oh, my God!

MELANIE:
W-was that, I mean, an actual—

DEAN:
Bona fide. Yeah. Well, no offense, but nobody's having psychic visions around here. This, uh, spirit, whoever she is, is giving them out.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
And then killing people?

DEAN:
Until we stop her. Well, the good news is you said you saw a clock and it read 2 a.m., so that gives us a little time. Now, does anybody recognize this chick?

MELANIE:
You know, I swear I've seen her, like in a painting or something.

DEAN:
A painting? Like, a—

MELANIE:
No, not a painting. In one of those old photos in the museum.

EXT. LILY DALE MUSEUM OF CURIOSITIES – DAY

INT. LILY DALE MUSEUM OF CURIOSITIES – DAY

A MUSEUM GUIDE is leading a group into a room in which SAM and DEAN are standing at opposite ends.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Lily Dale has long been a haven for the psychically gifted. Tortured elsewhere, they're embraced here. My own family has a modest natural gift. We also celebrate our long and colorful history of... embellishers.

People in the group laugh. The MUSEUM GUIDE gestures towards a display.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Ectoplasm illusion, circa 1890.

SAM rolls his eyes and walks out of the room. DEAN follows him.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Walking, walking. Now as you may know, ectoplasm...

DEAN walks past a historical poster advertising “Sibling Acts”.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
...comes from the Greek “ecto”...

SAM and DEAN are in a room with many photographs of people on the wall. The camera pans in on “The Mystifying Campbell Brothers”. SAM sighs.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Never ended well for the siblings.

DEAN:
Why is that?

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Mm, the strain of working together, or maybe just being around each other all their lives. Those two were the exception, actually – the Campbells. Got along famously. Of course, that was just a stage name. They weren't actually brothers. That was a cover for their, um... alternative lifestyle. Any other questions I can answer?

SAM:
Yes. Who are they?

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Oh, the Fox sisters – among the founders of Lily Dale. Kate Fox – quite troubled, apparently, but mesmerizing onstage. She's said to be able to levitate objects and foretell one's death.

DEAN (to SAM):
That's her.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Her older sister, Margaret – perhaps not a natural psychic.

DEAN:
So, full of crap.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Yes, well... she didn't have her sister's charisma, but she looked after Kate. Sometimes, one's true gift is taking care of others.

DEAN:
So, what happened to them?

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Lived here all their lives.

SAM:
Lived here and died here?

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Yes, well... buried in the cemetery.

SAM:
Great. That was very educational. Thank you. Dean.

SAM walks away. The MUSEUM GUIDE grabs DEAN’s arm.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
I’m sorry, I don't normally do this during business hours, but do you know an Eleanor... or an Ellen? She seems quite concerned about you. She wants to tell you – pardon me – if you don't tell someone how bad it really is, she'll kick your ass from beyond. You have to trust someone again eventually.

The MUSEUM GUIDE lets go of DEAN.

MUSEUM GUIDE:
Anyway, don't forget to visit the gift shop.

EXT. LILY DALE MUSEUM OF CURIOSITIES – DAY

DEAN walks down the museum steps to where SAM is waiting for him and they start walking away.

SAM:
All right. Hit up the graveyard, dig up Kate?

DEAN:
All right. Wait a second.

SAM:
All signs point to her, Dean.

DEAN:
No. Just hold on a damn minute.

SAM stops and turns to face DEAN.

DEAN:
Enough with "just the facts."

SAM:
We agreed—

DEAN:
No, we agreed to work the case. We didn't agree for you to be a dick the whole time.

SAM:
What?

DEAN:
You're pissed, okay? And you've got a right.

SAM:
Yeah, damn straight.

DEAN:
But enough's enough.

SAM:
Says who? Look, I'll work this damn case, but you lied to me, and you killed my friend.

SAM turns and walks away. DEAN walks after him.

DEAN:
No, I put down a monster who killed four people, and if you didn't know her, you'd have done the same thing.

SAM:
I did know her, Dean.

DEAN:
Yeah, which is why you couldn't do it.

SAM stops.

DEAN:
Look, I get it. There are certain people in this world, no matter how dangerous they are, you just can't.

SAM turns to face DEAN.

SAM:
Don't pull that card! That's bull. Look, if I've learned one thing, it's that if something feels wrong, it probably is!

DEAN:
Usually, yeah. But killing Amy was not wrong. You couldn't do it, so I did. That's what family does – the dirty work. And I woulda told you, eventually, once I knew that this whole "waving a gun at Satan" thing was a one-time show. I think it's reasonable to want to know that you're off the friggin' high dive, Sam. You almost got us both killed, so you can be pissed all you want, but quit being a bitch.

DEAN walks past SAM towards the Dodge. SAM stands still and watches him.

EXT. GRAVEYARD – NIGHT

SAM is digging a grave while DEAN holds a flashlight.

SAM:
I get why she's killing people. I don't get why she's warning them.

DEAN:
Give them a taste of the curse, maybe? It couldn't have been a joyride.

SAM finishes digging.

SAM:
Here we go.

DEAN pours lighter fluid and SAM pours salt onto the bones in the coffin. A woman GHOST materializes and rushes at SAM, sending him sprawling.

DEAN:
Sam! Back off, crazy eyes.

GHOST:
Listen to me. Why isn't anybody listening?

DEAN holds out his lighter and flicks it, but it doesn’t catch.

GHOST:
No.

DEAN:
You don't get a vote.

GHOST:
No! Stop!

DEAN flicks his lighter ineffectually and SAM flings a lit match into the grave.

GHOST:
No!

The GHOST burns up and vanishes.

DEAN:
Nice timing.

INT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT

MELANIE (on phone):
Got it. And, Dean, thanks.

MELANIE hangs up.

MELANIE:
They took care of it.

MELANIE’S FRIEND smiles broadly.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
Okay, so... what – just go home?

MELANIE:
I guess.

MELANIE’S FRIEND looks worried.

MELANIE:
Hey, why don't you come stay with me a couple days?

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
Thanks.

INT. MELANIE’S FRIEND’S HOUSE – NIGHT

MELANIE’S FRIEND is gathering things to take with her.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
Just one more minute.

MELANIE:
It's fine, hon.

MELANIE’S FRIEND:
Oh, if you had that vision, you wouldn't want to be here either.

The cuckoo clock chimes 2 o’clock.

MELANIE:
Camille, it's okay. Let's just go.

CAMILLE relives her vision.

MELANIE:
What is it?

The fire roars to life in the fireplace, the lights flicker and electricity crackles.

CAMILLE:
Call them back! Now!

EXT. STREET – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM are driving in the Dodge. DEAN’s phone rings.

DEAN (on phone):
Melanie?

The scene moves between the Dodge and CAMILLE’s house during the conversation.

MELANIE (on phone):
Dean, you have to come back.

DEAN (on phone):
What's going on?

MELANIE (on phone):
It's still happening!

DEAN (on phone):
Wait, what do you mean it's—

MELANIE (on phone):
She's still coming! Just tell me what the hell to do!

DEAN (on phone):
All right. Listen to me. Calm down.

SAM [taking the phone from DEAN]:
Dean, just give me the phone and drive.

SAM (on phone):
Melanie? Hey. Get to the kitchen.

MELANIE (on phone):
Okay.

The GHOST appears in front of CAMILLE, who screams.

MELANIE (on phone):
She's here!

SAM (on phone):
All right, just go. Get salt.

The GHOST hits CAMILLE, who screams again. The GHOST grabs CAMILLE by the throat. MELANIE flings salt at the GHOST, who disappears.

MELANIE (on phone):
It worked. She's gone!

CAMILLE is struggling for breath. The GHOST appears again behind her.

MELANIE (on phone):
No, she's back!

CAMILLE screams.

MELANIE (on phone):
I'm out of salt!

SAM (on phone):
Find iron. Is there a fireplace? Melanie!

MELANIE and CAMILLE are standing back-to-back. MELANIE is holding a fire poker. A chest of drawers crashes into MELANIE, who is flung into a wall and falls to the floor. CAMILLE screams.

CAMILLE:
Mel!

The GHOST appears behind CAMILLE and drags her backwards.

MELANIE:
Camille! Camille!

There is a sound of flesh tearing.

MELANIE:
Camille! No!

ACT THREE
EXT. CAMILLE’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM pull up in the Dodge. MELANIE is outside on the steps crying. DEAN puts his arms around MELANIE and holds her.

EXT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – DAY

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN:
Should have known that whole "good sis, bad sis" story was just showmanship crap. Oh, and it turns out that Kate was just trying to warn people about her evil bitch sister. And we burned her bones, so that's gone.

SAM:
Dean.

DEAN:
What?

SAM:
All we can do now is go stop her.

DEAN:
That's not good enough, by a mile.

SAM:
I know. Believe me. But – can we talk about this later?

MELANIE comes down the stairs in a bath robe. She is still crying.

DEAN:
Hey. How you holding up?

MELANIE:
Been better.

DEAN:
Listen, if you need for us to leave—

MELANIE:
I need you guys to leave.

SAM:
Sam: Okay, we will. It's just that... Look – Margaret is still out there.

MELANIE sobs.

MELANIE:
What do you guys need to know?

SAM:
Is there anything that stood out?

MELANIE:
Well, um... she barely gave a crap about me. I mean, I was just in the way. She was all about getting Camille.

DEAN:
Okay. That's something.

MELANIE:
One other thing. Um... she enjoyed it. She was smiling.

EXT. GRAVEYARD – DAY

A headstone reads:

MARGARET FOX

BORN

OCTOBER 7TH 1833

DIED

MARCH 8TH 1893

DEAN is digging the grave. SAM is crouching with a shovel.

DEAN:
I feel naked doing this in daylight.

SAM:
Yeah. Let's just hurry up.

SAM is now digging while DEAN stands watch. SAM crashes the shovel down onto the coffin to break it open.

DEAN:
All right, Mags. My lighter's juiced this time.

SAM lifts the top of the coffin out of the grave. He and DEAN look at each other. The coffin is empty.

DEAN and SAM walk through the cemetery to the Dodge.

DEAN:
Geraldo'd.

SAM:
Not good.

DEAN:
Never good.

SAM:
Dean, if someone knew enough to take Margaret's bones, they're not kidding around. That's serious binding magic.

DEAN:
Great.

DEAN puts his shovel and bag into the trunk of the Dodge.

DEAN:
Psychic ghost bitch on a leash.

SAM:
We got to find those bones.

DEAN:
So we got to find the bonehead.

DEAN takes a folded piece of paper out of his pocket and tosses it into the trunk.

SAM:
So, what? We call Bobby, see what it take to harness the power of a ghost?

DEAN:
Yeah.

DEAN looks at the piece of paper he’s just tossed into the trunk, picks it up and unfolds it. It is a flyer for the Annual Lily Dale Psychic Festival.

DEAN:
Hey, Sam, you know why I'm not going to spend my money at the annual Lily Dale E.S.P. Festival and hot-dog-eating contest this year?

DEAN holds the flyer out for SAM to see. The featured acts were to be Imelda Graven, Grandma Goldy and Nikolai Lishin.

SAM:
Can't imagine.

DEAN:
Because all the headliners are dead.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – DAY

MELANIE is looking at the flyer.

MELANIE:
You know, after Nikolai... They asked Camille to take his spot. I mean, she's so popular. Was so popular.

DEAN:
Okay, uh, all these people – would you say that they're the, uh, you know, top dogs in town?

MELANIE:
Well, it's not really like that.

DEAN:
But they were all doing well. I mean, your grandma?

MELANIE:
She wrote a few books. Yeah, and Imelda was on "The Nate Berkus Show" twice, so, yeah, I guess they were doing pretty well. You think that's why she went after them?

DEAN:
I mean, if you had to guess, who do you think would be next in line?

MELANIE:
I mean, I don't know.

DEAN:
Well, your grandma was headlining at the big hall, so who do you think they would ask to fill in for her?

MELANIE:
Probably... me.

INT. EMPORIUM – DAY

SAM:
Hey.

JIMMY:
Agent. Are you here with my check?

SAM:
I'm looking for someone who bought some things from you.

SAM puts a piece of paper down on the counter.

JIMMY:
How do you know from me?

SAM:
I'm kind of doubting they sell ash-wood altars at the Gas 'n Sip.

JIMMY:
Valid. Let me see the list.

JIMMY takes out some record books.

JIMMY:
Ah. Here we go. Credit-card receipt. I assume you want the address?

SAM:
That’d be great. Thanks.

JIMMY:
It's the least I can do. I just heard about Camille Thibodeaux.

JIMMY hands a piece of paper on which he’s written an address to SAM.

SAM:
Thanks a lot.

SAM leaves.

JIMMY:
You're welcome.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN is making a salt circle around himself and MELANIE.

MELANIE:
You sure that'll work?

DEAN:
That should hold her off long enough for Sam to find the bones and burn them. Hopefully.

MELANIE:
Hopefully? Does it hurt 'em? Burning their bones?

DEAN:
I never really thought about it. Probably, yeah.

MELANIE:
Good.

EXT. STREET – NIGHT

SAM is driving a station wagon. He stops outside a house and checks the address on the piece of paper JIMMY TOMORROW gave him.

INT. HOUSE – NIGHT

SAM bursts through the door with his gun drawn. People scream.

SAM:
Where's the altar?

The room contains pregnant women and their partners and an INSTRUCTOR, all seated on cushions on the floor.

INSTRUCTOR:
It's there!

SAM turns around to look at the altar.

SAM:
You're... not a necromancer.

INSTRUCTOR:
This is a Lamaze class, I swear.

SAM:
I-I believe you. Sorry.

SAM leaves. The INSTRUCTOR strikes the bowl she is holding to make a ringing noise and starts chanting.

INSTRUCTOR:
Omm...

EXT. LAMAZE INSTRUCTOR’S HOUSE – NIGHT

SAM (on phone):
Dean, it's the pawn-shop guy.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN (on phone):
How do you know?

SAM (on phone, V-O):
He goose-chased me to a friggin'...

EXT. LAMAZE INSTRUCTOR’S HOUSE – NIGHT

SAM (on phone):
...pregnant yoga class.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN (on phone):
All right, well, figure out where he put her bones.

MELANIE gasps.

SAM (on phone, V-O):
I will.

MARGARET’S GHOST is at the window.

DEAN (on phone):
Fast, Sam.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE EMPORIUM – NIGHT

SAM shuts the door of the station wagon and walks to the Emporium, which is closed. He takes out JIMMY TOMORROW’s business card:

Jimmy Tomorrow

Private Readings

NO FUTURE TOO GRIM

809 Main Street

Lily Dale, N.Y. U.S.A. 14752

and walks along the street looking at the street numbers. He sees 811, turns around and finds 809 ½.

INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

SAM opens the door and enters with his gun drawn. He looks around the dark room and walks over to a table on which there is a skull, a lit candle and some other objects. SAM picks up the skull. There is the sound of a gun being cocked and the gun appears at the back of SAM’s neck.

JIMMY:
Somehow, I just knew you'd be back.

ACT FOUR
INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

JIMMY:
Hi, Agent. Put the skull down.

SAM:
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Here.

SAM raises the skull so JIMMY can take it from him. As JIMMY does, SAM turns, takes the gun from JIMMY and shoves him backwards.

SAM:
All right. That's enough.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN and MELANIE are inside the salt circle, looking at the window.

MELANIE:
Is she gone?

DEAN:
I doubt it.

MELANIE:
But she can't get past the line, right?

DEAN:
Right.

The window glass bursts inwards and wind howls in.

INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

SAM knocks over the table that the skull and other objects were on.

SAM:
Nice binding spell.

JIMMY:
It doesn't matter. She helps me because she wants to.

SAM:
What?

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

DEAN is pointing a shotgun at the broken window. The wind breaks the salt circle.

DEAN:
Oh. Damn it. I hate when they do that. Get the salt. Go.

MELANIE:
Dean!

DEAN turns around. MARGARET’S GHOST is in what remains of the salt circle. She holds up a hand and flings DEAN backwards. MARGARET’S GHOST turns to MELANIE, who is holding a fire poker.

JIMMY (V-O):
Margaret and me...

INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

JIMMY:
...are the same. We're the real thing.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

MARGARET’S GHOST is advancing on MELANIE, who walks backwards.

JIMMY (V-O):
But guess what – sometimes the real thing just isn't...

INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

JIMMY:
...pretty or entertaining enough.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

MARGARET’S GHOST raises a hand towards MELANIE, then disappears. DEAN has shot her.

INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

JIMMY:
When I show people what I'm capable of, it scares them. I can't pay my rent!

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

MELANIE is pouring salt. She gasps: MARGARET’S GHOST has reappeared.

DEAN:
Get behind me.

DEAN steps in front of MELANIE and raises his shotgun.

DEAN:
That's as far as you go, bitch.

INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

JIMMY:
Margaret's happy to kill for me. She likes the leash.

SAM:
You're sick.

JIMMY:
You know what else I am? A real psychic, you dick-bag.

JIMMY raises a hand. SAM’s gun flies out of SAM’s hand to the floor and JIMMY picks it up.

JIMMY:
Surprise.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

MARGARET’S GHOST smiles as the room starts to shake and lights flicker. The salt line breaks again as the floor splits.

MARGARET’S GHOST:
Aw. Sorry, handsome.

DEAN shoots and MARGARET’S GHOST disappears.

INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

SAM:
Where are the rest of the bones?

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

MARGARET’S GHOST appears again. DEAN tries to shoot, but his gun doesn’t fire. He picks up a metal chain from his bag and flings it at her. MARGARET’S GHOST disappears.

INT. 809 ½ MAIN STREET – NIGHT

SAM:
These people don't deserve to die.

JIMMY:
Oh, come on! Are you kidding me? I live in squalor 'cause I can't put on a show like them?

SAM:
Don't do this. They're in the bedroom, aren't they?

JIMMY:
No.

JIMMY shoots at SAM, but doesn’t hit him.

JIMMY:
You're not getting in there.

JIMMY looks behind him. As he does, SAM takes out another gun and shoots him dead. SAM sighs.

INT. MELANIE GOLDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Too bad.

ACT FIVE
INT. GOOD GRACES CAFE – DAY

DEAN and SAM are at a table.

DEAN:
In the bed? They were in the bed?

SAM:
Yeah.

DEAN:
Ugh. I can't believe he was boning her.

SAM:
Dean.

WAITER:
Can I get you anything else?

DEAN:
Uh, just a refill. And if you affirmate me, I'm gonna punch you in the face.

SAM looks away and smiles.

WAITER:
All righty then. Coffee, coming up.

DEAN:
I can't wait to get out of this frickin' fortune cookie.

SAM sees MELANIE enter the cafe.

SAM:
Dean.

MELANIE looks around the cafe. DEAN raises a hand to catch her attention.

SAM:
I'm gonna go, um... do something outside.

SAM heads for the door.

MELANIE (to SAM as she passes him):
Hi.

DEAN stands up as MELANIE comes to the table.

DEAN:
Hi.

MELANIE:
Hi.

DEAN:
Have a seat.

MELANIE:
Oh, thank you.

DEAN:
Yeah.

MELANIE:
You didn't stick around so I could say thank you.

DEAN:
No reason to thank me.

MELANIE:
You saved my life.

DEAN:
Yeah, but not your friend's.

MELANIE:
Well... you didn't send that ghost, so... thank you for coming to kill it. You and Sam seem a little better.

DEAN:
You could tell that from the walk up?

MELANIE:
[smiling] Take it or leave it. Also guessing you're not so keen to come visit here again, so...this is goodbye. Wish we'd met on a better week.

DEAN:
I wish I had better weeks.

MELANIE:
Oh.

DEAN:
But, uh, hey. You never know. It's not like you can tell the future, right?

MELANIE:
Hmm.

MELANIE takes DEAN’s hand, turns it over and looks at his palm.

MELANIE:
Well, answer's hazy. Try again later.

DEAN:
Right.

EXT. STREET – DAY

SAM is putting his bag into the trunk of the Dodge. DEAN walks up.

DEAN:
Hey.

SAM:
Hey.

DEAN:
That's your stuff.

SAM:
Yeah. Yeah. I figured we'd take one car.

DEAN:
Works for me. You still want to break my face?

SAM smiles.

SAM:
No. Uh, not at this moment. Look, you know what? Um... You were right. About Amy. If she was... just any monster, I'm not sure I could have let her walk away. I don't know. I mean, I'll never know.

DEAN:
So, what are you saying?

SAM:
What I'm saying is... I get why you did it. You were just trying to make sure no one else got hurt. But here's the thing. You can't just look me in the face and tell me you're fine. I mean, you're not sleeping, you drink for the record—

DEAN:
Oh, here we go.

SAM:
Look, whatever. Last one to preach, I know. But... Just be honest with me. How are those the actions of someone who knows they did the right thing?

DEAN:
You want me to be honest?

SAM:
Yeah.

DEAN:
I went with my gut. And that felt right. I didn't trust her, Sam. Of course, ever since Cas, I'm having a hard time trusting anybody. And as far as how I been acting... I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause I don't like lying to you. You know, it doesn't feel right. So, yeah, you got me there. I been climbing the walls.

SAM:
I know how that is. But, hey... If I learned one thing from that museum, sibling acts are tough.

DEAN:
Oh, don't compare us to that hall of crazy.

DEAN walks around to the driver’s door and SAM to the passenger door.

DEAN:
We're like poster kids of functional family life compared to them.

SAM:
It's a low bar.

DEAN:
Well, hey... grading on a curve has got me past everything since kindergarten, so don't knock it.

SAM:
Whatever you say.

They get into the car.

SAM:
I still want to know how that guy bent my spoon.

DEAN:
Forget it, Sam. It's Lily Dale.

They drive away.
