ACT 1
(EXT. To an underground warehouse Rowena lighting a candle and looking at Three Witches.)

Rowena: ...and they shall know us far and wide and fear us. And we shall be known as the... Mega Coven! !Mega!Coven. See, because it's greater than Grand Coven. So it's not grand, it's mega! It's the Mega Coven. I don't think you're followin'.

Witch 1: And whyever would we join you in such a thing?

Rowena: Because that Grand Coven of yours is obsolete. Don't you see? And utterly falling apart since the high priestess Olivette disappeared.

Witch 2: Which we hear you may have had a hand in.

Rowena: Idle gossip.

Witch 3: Cut the crap, Rowena. You're just looking for protection from the hunter Winchesters and all the rest of your many enemies.

Witch 2: And, honey, you don't have the guts or the chops to pull this off, so let's not kid ourselves.

Rowena: Really? It so happens, I killed the King of Hell. My own son, the King of Hell, and compelled an angel to do it. Guts? Chops? I'd say that qualifies.

Witch 3: I have a friend who cut a deal with Crowley only yesterday. Crowley didn't look so dead.

Rowena: What?

Witch 3: You're as delusional as ever. We'll be going.

Rowena: Delusional? We'll see.

[ROWENA removes the cover from her altar revealing the Book of the Damned which she places her hand upon]

Vomicae, putramen, nex!

[The three witches scream and turn into ash]

He lives?


(TITLE SEQUENCE)


(Ext. Dean is having a flashback of standing in the Black Fog with the Darkness. When she turns around and looks at him the flashback ends. INT. Dean sitting in the Library with Sam and Castiel)

Sam: So that was the last of the neighbors, just like the rest. Dean? Dean!

Dean: Yeah.

Sam: You okay?

Dean: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

Sam: Just saying we got nothing. No one saw anything unusual going on at the house the day the baby disappeared.

Castiel: If this is truly the Darkness we're talking about, it's more of a time bomb than a baby.

Dean: Yeah, but it is still a baby, right? I mean, the Darkness I saw was an adult. So it still has to, uh, grow up.

Castiel: The Darkness is almost infinite power. I'm not sure what “growing up" means in this case.

Sam: Well, God kicked this thing's ass once before, right?

Dean: Yeah, it'd be nice if he put down the Mai Tai and show up for work.

Castiel: I wouldn't count on it.

Sam: It's possible he's around. Closer than we think, you know?

Dean: What makes you say that?

Castiel: I believe he made a fairly definitive statement when we walked away.

(As Castiel is talking he stands up and you see him with shackles chained to the floor)

Dean: Sorry about those, Cas. Till we know what's going on with you, you're still a bit of a wild card, you know?

Sam: I hate to point this out, but you both know who we might need to help deal with the Darkness.

Dean: Don't even say it.

Sam: He was God's scribe. He did hear about everything.

Dean: That's just like saying it. Cas, you all right, pal?

Castiel: It's the spell.

Sam: We were hoping your angel wiring would fight it off or...slow it down at least.

Castiel: It appears I simply respond differently from humans.

Dean: If you were you human, you'd be gone. With you, it's like it's digging deeper.

Sam: You know, Rowena's the only one who can remove it.

Dean: We're doing everything to find her, okay? But so far, we got nothing.

Sam (whispering): Well, it's getting worse.

(EXT. In Hell Crowley is speaking with his right hand demon in Amara’s bedroom doorway)

Right Hand Demon: Yes, majesty, my operative is certain. Your mother has been found.

Crowley: Then move. Annihilate the treacherous bitch.

(Crowley motions the Demon Nanny over)

Demon Nanny: She's making impressive progress in her studies, considering just days ago she was in diapers.

Crowley: Watch her. She speaks to no one outside the court. If she's half as powerful as I think she is, I want her on my team.

Demon Nanny: Amara's a pretty name. Did you name her?

Crowley: That's what the lovely Jenna called her, just before Amara sucked out her soul. What do we have her watching now?

Demon Nanny: Hitler's Nuremberg speeches. We had them translated.

Crowley: Hmm. Amara, sweetie? You can take a little break if you like. Nanny said you're doing very well with your schooling. I want you to be happy in your new home. Whatever you want, whenever you want it, you just have to ask.

Young Amara: I just want you to save me, from him.

Crowley: From God? He's been very mean to my little girl, hasn't he?

Young Amara: He tricked me.

Crowley: He's a wily one.

Young Amara: He sealed me away.

Crowley: And how exactly did he manage that?

Young Amara: I don't want to talk about it.

Crowley: Of course. You're a very lucky girl. I'm a king. And if anyone can protect you from that rascally deity, it is I.

Young Amara: Thank you.

Crowley: “Thank you, Uncle Crowley.”

(INT. Rowena at a restaurant with two other witches)

Rowena: Hmm: “How did this happen” I kept asking myself. Witchcraft was a proud and adventurous calling. But the Grand Coven let it collapse in disgrace. Cowardly witches hiding in shadows.

Witch 1: Well, we were being burned or hung by the thousands.

Witch 2: It put a lid on our enthusiasm.

Rowena: Nonsense. Poor leadership. Our people deserve a renaissance. And I'm looking for the best of the best to leave the Grand Coven and join me in...the... Mega Coven. You hear what I said, right?

Witch 2: My...Look at the time.

Witch 1: Hmm.

Rowena: Did I mention I have in my possession the Book of the Damned? Aye, written by crazy sister Agnes herself, on her own flesh. Its secrets are making me a force of nature, girls. A force of nature.

Witch 2: And you'd share these secrets with the...Mega Coven?

Rowena: I've always been a giver.

Witch 1: Is there a chance I could be an officer? In the Grand Coven, I never made it past sergeant-at-arms.

Rowena: You have no idea the rewards headed your way.

(At that moment one of the Waiters, possessed by a demon, pulls out a dagger and attacks)

Witch 1 (as her neck is slashed): Defende nos.

Rowena: Meatus impeditus.

(EXT. Back to the Library in the Bunker, Dean pacing on the phone, while Sam and Castiel watch from the table)

Dean: Come on, Crowley, pick up. I've left you a dozen messages. Why isn't he answering the phone?

Sam: Because he's a dick, and that's not breaking news.

Dean: He's gotta have Rowena in his sights, right? I mean, she did try to take him out.

Castiel: He's not gonna deliver Rowena to us just so she can lift the spell. He'd rather let it do whatever it's gonna do to me.

Dean: He's gotta be up to something.

Sam: Yeah. Again, not breaking news. Metatron is also off the grid. He stole your car in Blaine, Missouri, right?

Castiel: Yeah.

Sam: Yeah, uh, no accidents, incidents, violations, or anything remotely interesting involving a crappy '78 Continental Mark V.

Castiel: You think it's crappy?

Dean: Eye of the beholder.

Sam: Yeah.

Castiel: A shut-in for centuries, former scribe of God. You wouldn't think he would be a good driver.

Sam: You know what? I'll look for unusual occurrences at places he might hang out. Cas?

Dean: Places Metatron might hang out.

Castiel: Um... I mean, he loves waffles. You could try places that have those.

Dean: Okay, so, every restaurant in the entire country. Cas?

(Castiel starts groaning and falls out of his chair)

Castiel: Aah!

Dean: Cas? Cas, hey! Easy! Easy! Cas?!


ACT II
(INT. Library Bunker Sam and Dean are leaning over Castiel who has fallen out of his Chair from the effects of Rowena’s spell.)

Sam: Cas? Hey. Are you okay?

Castiel: Relative to what?

Dean: You know where you are? What's the date?

Castiel: Earth. Several billion years from the beginning.

Dean: Come on, buddy. Come on.

Castiel: It's like I was... inside a blender that was set to purée for a tomato salsa.

Dean: And you're the tomato?

Castiel: In this analogy, yes.

Dean: Yeah.

Sam: Cas, what was that? You scared the crap out of us.

Castiel: I blacked out for a lot of it. But I... I don't know. It overwhelmed me. I-I couldn't control it.

Dean: Let's get him up. Come on, come on. Here you go. We gotta find that witch.

Sam: Yeah.

Castiel: What can I do to help?

Sam: No, no, no, you just, uh, sit there and take a breather, try and put yourself back together.

Castiel: Okay. I'll do my best. It's... It's difficult with these voices.

Sam: Now there are voices?

Dean: Are these voices telling you to hurt someone?

Castiel: No. Guys, I'm -- I'm hearing Angel radio. It's a lot of chatter. They're... They've been looking for me ever since I escaped, as well as scouring the earth for the perp. It's slang for “perpetrator”.

Dean: Ah.

Sam: Yeah, thank you. Um, a-any...”perp” in particular?

Castiel: Metatron. They're doubling the effort to find him, so... If we need to get hold of him, we better do it soon.

Dean: Yeah, before the God squad does. All right, well, first thing's first.

Sam: Listen to this. May be something here. Uh, in Denver, three women were at this Café Elta, when their waiter, for no apparent reason, stabbed and killed one. One survived and the third vanished after furniture seemed to slide around by itself. What do you think?

Dean (on phone): Hi, who's your lead on the Café Elta investigation?

(EXT. In Hell Young Amara is in her room going through photos of the world when she gets up and walks to her full length mirror, where the Grown Darkness from the Black Fog stares back at her)

Grown Darkness: You look confused. Troubled.

Young Amara: God did all of this after he locked me away. I didn't know it was so much.

Grown Darkness: All for his own ego. And no matter what he made, that doesn't excuse what he did to us.

Young Amara: I know.

Grown Darkness: Amara... You must stay fixed on our purpose. Even we cannot undo what's already done. But as you grow and become stronger, your true destiny will become clear to you. I am what you are becoming. And we are mightier than God.

(Crowley opens her Bedroom door and strolls in, Young Amara turns from the mirror and the Darkness vanishes)

Crowley: Not in bed yet?

Young Amara (sitting back down at her desk): Not yet. Soon.

Crowley: Working on your studies. Good girl. Learning anything interesting?

Young Amara: I think so.

Crowley: Hmm.

(INT. A bar with few customers, one man in a suit sitting at the bar looking up when another suited man walks in. The man at the bar stands up staring down the new entry flashing his eyes black, the Man who walked in drops an Angel Blade from his coat sleeve. They stare each other down when finally the Demon sits back down at the bar and the angel approaches and joins him)

Demon: Hey.

Angel: Hey.

Demon: Pretty bad in heaven?

Angel: Yep. How 'bout downstairs?

Demon: Yeah, don't get me started.

Angel: Alarms go off?

Demon: You wouldn't believe.

Angel: I know, right? Us, too.

Demon: Something's changed.

Angel: Something's here.

Demon: It's big. Big as God. Big as Lucifer.

Angel: They doing anything about it on your end?

Demon: Zip. How 'bout upstairs?

Angel: Ah, business as usual. You'd think there'd be an executive order, but...

Demon: The King's holed up doing who knows what.

Angel: After Hannah died, Heaven's pretty much been a suck sandwich.

Demon: You know who gets squeezed? It’s grunts like us.

Angel: Yeah, punch a clock, you're expendable.

Demon: You know, our two operations will always butt heads. That's the set up. But this? We could be out of work.

Angel: Yeah. We get knocked out, it takes over.

Demon: Someone's gotta do something.

Angel: Someone?

Demon: Yeah. If management won't, it's up to the little guy.

Angel: Yeah. I hear ya.

Demon: Power to the people, my friend.

Angel: Well, not actually people.

Demon: You know what I mean.

(EXT. Police Headquarters, Denver. Sam and Dean in their FBI getups walking into an interrogation room holding Witch 2 from the meeting with Rowena)

Sam: Thanks.

Police Officer: Agents, here you go.

Dean: We got it. Yep.

Sam: Hello.

Dean: So, ladies lunch goes south when a waiter, who reeks of sulfur, attacks with a blade, killing one of you, while the redhead who invited you yells something in Latin, disappears and the furniture forms a pile. That about right?

Witch: Uh-huh.

Sam: Any idea why a demon would wanna attack three witches?

Witch: I-I don't know what you're talking about.

Sam: Right. The waiter was possessed by a demon assassin who was gunning for Rowena, since she tried to kill her son Crowley, who just so happens to be the King of Hell.

Witch: Why do I think you're not F.B.I. Like the police said?

Dean: Let's cut to it. The cops say that you're so scared, you don't wanna leave here. Well, you should be, 'cause Crowley's not only going after Rowena, he's going after every witch that she hangs with.

Witch: I-I'm no witch.

Dean: Sure, you are. And your pal Rowena, she's recruiting a new coven. Hmm?

Witch: You can't do this. I have rights.

Dean: And I have a fake badge.

Sam (upending the witch’s purse): Look at this. Chicken bones. Hex bags. A pentagram. Still sticking with, uh… Not a witch?

Witch: Abite, ab oculis meis--

Dean: Ah, ah, ah, ah. Listen, before you finish what you're about to say, know that we are the only thing between you and Crowley's ninjas.

Witch: But I didn't try to hurt him. I mean, I am nobody. I-I'm worse than nobody. I-I'm nobody's third cousin who doesn't even get invited to dinner.

Sam: We don't care. We just need to know where Rowena is.

Witch: I have no idea.

Sam: But you do know how to scry, is that right?

Witch: Scry? What's that?

Sam: Exactly what you know it is. A locating spell. When you witches use crystals and then prisms and mirrors to divine images of who you're trying to find.

Dean: We're trying to get our hands on Rowena. Okay, now with her out of the picture, Crowley has no reason to go after you. You got it?

Witch: I don't have my crystals.

Dean (while picking up a cosmetic mirror from her bag): Oh. Well... This ought to work, huh? I'll get the light.

Witch: Ostende mihi illum quem quaero. I see her. She's packing a bag.

(INT. Amara’s bedroom in hell, Crowley enters while the Demon Nanny is standing to the side watching Amara play Scrabble)

Crowley: Amara. I have a gift for you. Two, actually.

Young Amara: Is that...Blood?

Crowley: Probably. And... You have to forgive me for being the tiger mom, but it's never too soon to improve your mind with books.

Young Amara: Agreed, but I like the one nanny gave me more.

Crowley: “Dante's Inferno”? In the original Italian. Has nanny been teaching you other things about our world?

Young Amara: Some. Doesn't work very well, does it?

Crowley: That's God for you. Not really thought out. The whole big bang thing? More of a big bust. I mean, boom, bang, stars, evolution, Taylor Swift. I'm guessing you'd have done things differently.

Young Amara: I sure will. I've had a lot of time to think it through.

Crowley: Any...specifics that we have to look forward to?

Young Amara: I'm hungry.

Crowley: Of course. Goodies!

Young Amara (after she sucks the black demon soul from the nanny): I killed her.

Crowley: Not...Quite. The meat suit was already dead. It was just the soul that was inside it that was keeping it alive.

Young Amara: Not anymore. Thank you, Uncle Crowley.

Crowley: You're welcome.


ACT III
(EXT. Rowena comes out of a brick building, in disguise with a blonde wig, carrying her suitcases towards a yellow Taxi)

Rowena: Airport. And be careful with the bags. They're antiquities. Abi!

Dean: Uhh! Aah!

Rowena: Just my way of giving you the finger... Mr. Winchester.

Dean: Aah!

Rowena: I don't suppose you're here to thank me for removing the Mark of Cain, which, by the way, you're welcome. Let's just take things up a notch. What do you say?

(Sam comes from the side and puts the magic canceling handcuffs on Rowena)

Rowena: I think you'd know by now, Samuel, these things don't hold me long.

Sam: I just need to hold you long enough.

Rowena: Well, they do say blondes have more fun.

(INT. Castiel in the Library Bunker on Sam’s Laptop attempting to find Metatron)

Castiel: “To pull up information on a car, “select search box, “type in violations. “And enter license plate number, make...”

(Castiel hits a button and the search engine minimizes. He clicls a link on the desktop trying to bring it back. Instead a porn site comes up.)

Sensual Female voice: Fortune Nookie, your premiere web site for all your Asian girl fantasies. We have hundreds of lovely girls just waiting to chat with you 24 hours a day.

(Castiel closes the laptop)

Castiel: What could “Fortune Nookie” be?

(Castiel has flashes of when he was first cursed by Rowena)

Rowena: Impetus bestiarum.

Crowley: Castiel… Don't!

Rowena: Dele malum...

(EXT. The throne room in Hell. Crowley is seated on the throne watching Amara sucking another soul from one of his demons)

Crowley: Cafeteria is serving dead meat suits, right?

Right Hand Demon: Yes, majesty. No chance of soulless lunatics roaming the halls.

Young Amara: Did I hear someone mention dessert?

Crowley: In a minute, sweetheart. Now, what were we just chatting about?

Young Amara: How when God created mankind, he really screwed it up.

Crowley: Language! Is that any way for a primal force to speak?

Young Amara: Every time I take in a soul, I feel how much emptiness there is.

Crowley: Yes.

Young Amara: God made a world where people have to suffer, and then they die.

Crowley: Unfortunately.

Young Amara: But frankly, why would they want to live in such a world?

Crowley: I salute your insight, cupcake. Yes, God's plan is hideously flawed. But you and I together? Well, we can shape things to our own world view. A place where, like the dinosaur, virtue is extinct, where the very air that we breathe is pure evil. Would you like that?

Young Amara: Would you? You'd really be happy if everyone... was evil?

Crowley: Well...Actually, now I come to think of it, if everyone was dark and damned, wouldn't be much of a challenge. Watching a human reject the light and embrace depravity... Yes, well, that's where the gratification really is. Never gets old. This bemuses you?

Young Amara: Good, evil, heaven, hell, people… It all seems so unimportant.

Crowley: Well, I don't know that I'd say that.

Young Amara: I don't think you're seeing the big picture.

Crowley: Meaning what exactly?

Young Amara: Guess what, Uncle Crowley? I'm hungry.

(Crowley snaps his fingers and two demons drag in another demon struggling to get away)

Next victim: No!

(INT. Back at the Bunker in the holding Cell, Dean is chaining Rowena to the chair in the Devils trap. Sam is searching her luggage)

Rowena: Mind the undergarments, Samuel. Imported, of course.

Sam: Where is it?

Rowena: Where is what, dear?

Sam: The book! The Book of the Damned. The codex is in there, but the book is not. So where the hell is it?

Rowena: Do you take me for a fool? Like I'd run around with those two spectacularly powerful items anywhere in proximity.

Sam: Well, now we've got the codex and Charlie's code-breaking, so the book isn't as useful to you as it was.

Rowena: Or so you hope. That's what I admire in you, Samuel. That plucky optimism. That plucky, stupid optimism.

Dean: Sam, why don't you go grab Cas, so Florence Nightingale here can do her stuff?

Rowena: Hmm.

Sam: Yeah.

Rowena: You do recall our deal, eh? First I de-spell the angel, then I go free.

Dean: Mm, except for one thing.

Rowena: There were no exceptions in our arrangement.

Dean: The book. Gonna need that baby back.

Rowena: The book was never mentioned in our negotiations.

Dean: Well, now it is.

Rowena: Our deal says --

Dean: Our deal says whatever I want it to say. You're gonna play by my rules because I have your son on speed dial.

Rowena: Call him. If I'm dead, you've got a big fat pile of nothing. No book ever. And your friend with the bent halo? He goes foaming-at-the-mouth mad and dies. Your turn! Your eyes... So burdened. What happened precisely when I removed the Mark? The book wasn't specific. Yes, I read quite a bit of it. What new hell has Dean Winchester unleashed upon the world?

Sam: Dean!

Dean: Yeah?

Sam: Hey, I can't find Cas.

Dean: What?

Sam: He's not there. He -- he -- he broke free. He's gone.


ACT IV
(EXT. Castiel is in an alley way clearly under the influence of Rowena’s attack dog spell.)

(INT. Dean, Sam, and Rowena in the Impala)

Rowena: So absurd, driving in circles looking for your unhinged angel.

Dean: We're not driving in circles, all right? We're locked onto his phone's G.P.S. We're tracking his location.

Rowena: I have no idea what you just said, but I'm sure I could do it faster.

Sam: Yeah, maybe you could, but you would have to do a spell, which means we would have to take the cuffs off, and we are not going to take the cuffs off.

Rowena: There's no trust? Are we not a team?

Sam and Dean (in unison): No.

(EXT. The throne room in Hell with Crowley speaking to his previously Right Hand Demon who is now dressed as the Nanny)

Demon Nanny: You sent for me, sire?

Crowley: I wanted to commend you for how well you've stepped into your new role as nanny after the last one became indisposed.

Demon Nanny: “Indisposed”? She's dead.

Crowley: At any rate, you seem to be cut out for this kind of work. Amara clearly responds to you.

Demon Nanny: She looks at me like she wants to eat me.

Crowley: She wants to eat everyone. Don't take it personally.

Demon Nanny: Majesty, uh, I have no experience with children. Um, is there nothing else I can do?

Crowley: Apparently not, seeing as you failed to assassinate my mother. I'd hate to be disappointed twice.

Demon Nanny: I'm aware.

Crowley: So, here's the thing. Amara seems to be growing in leaps and bounds. Not just in maturity, but in strength and confidence, too. I don't want her to get out of hand before I'm sure of her loyalty. I need you to stop overfeeding her.

Demon Nanny: But you said to give her whatever she wants whenever she wants it.

Crowley: Well, now I'm saying something different, aren't I?

Demon Nanny: Yes.

Crowley: We don't want a generation of entitled, pudgy kids, do we? No, we do not. So simply inform her that we're cutting back on her soul food. It's, uh, it's the healthier choice.

Demon Nanny: You want me to tell her this?

Crowley: You are her nanny, aren't you?

Demon Nanny: Well --

Crowley: 'cause if you're not the nanny, then what are you? Oh, I know -- roasting on a spit until the end of time.

Demon Nanny: I'll, uh, do my best.

Crowley: Good man. And you look wonderful in an apron.

(INT. Back in the Impala with Sam, Dean and Rowena going after a missing Castiel)

Rowena: You wouldn't think a road trip with two such strapping lads could be this tedious. Shall we have a wee sing-song?

Sam and Dean (in unison): No!

Rowena: I have myself to blame. Should never make deals with Winchesters, since they seem unable to hold up their end of the bargain.

Dean: Meaning what?

Rowena: Oh, just that thing between Sam, Crowley, and myself.

Dean: What? What's she talking about?

Rowena: Oh, surely, you knew Sam made a deal with me to kill my son if I removed the Mark of Cain from your arm. Well, is the Mark gone? Yes. Is Crowley dead? No. Mm. Oh, he didn't know? He didn't know!

Sam: Look, I was gonna tell you. Obviously, nothing ever came of it, so I-I figured there was no point, you know?

Dean: No point, huh?

Rowena: I-I mean, I see what Dean's saying. Your wee pal Castiel wouldn't be in this pickle if you'd done what you'd promised. I would've had no reason to cast the attack dog spell if Crowley were already dead. Excellent point.

Dean: It's not my point. Sam knows my point. Keyword -- secrets.

Rowena: Ah, well, I'm just glad I got the conversation flowing. Family relations are a speciality of mine.

Sam: Hey.

Dean: Did he stop?

Sam: Yeah, he stopped. And he's close.

(EXT. To Castiel under the attack dog spell stalking a girl in an alley. She sees him, screams then runs with him chasing. INT. Back to the impala parked in a different alley with Sam and dean getting out and pulling Rowena along)

Dean: Come on. All right, he's gotta be around here somewhere. So I'll head up the street, you guys head the other way.

Rowena: Are you joking? I'm in heels.

(EXT. To the girl running and Castiel not far behind, she runs into an abandoned warehouse but he sniffs the building out and starts tearing the crates apart looking for her hiding place. INT. To Dean walking down a road when he hears the crates being smashed around, he follows the sound to the warehouse, walking up to the door. EXT. the pedestrian is hiding behind a metal shelf when she turns around and sees Castiel who proceeds to grab her throat)

Pedestrian: Aah!

Dean: Cas! Cas! Don't do this. Okay, this isn't you. It's the spell. You can beat this. Cas... Let her go. Go! Go, go, go. Hey. Okay, okay. It's gonna be okay, buddy, all right? Uhh!

(Rowena and Sam show up as Castiel starts attacking Dean after he let the Pedestrian go)

Rowena: Desiste.

Sam: Do I need to remind you these are witch-killing bullets? Finish it!

Rowena: Yes, yes, all right. Adlevo onus tuum.

Dean: Cas? Cas? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Hey.

Rowena: Permitte telum. Abi!

Sam: Uhh!

Dean: No!

Rowena: Impedi! I'm sure you had every intention of honoring our deal. But why take chances?


ACT V
(INT. Back in the bunker with Sam, Dean and Castiel in the command center, Sam walking in with a beer for Dean who has an ice pack being applied to the side of his bruised face)

Sam: Hey. You should keep applying that.

Dean: Thanks, mom. You just keep the beers comin'.

Castiel: Dean, I... There aren't words.

Dean: You're right. There aren't words, Cas, 'cause there's no need. You were under a spell. It's fine.

Castiel: Yeah, but you had Rowena. Because of me, you...

Sam: You know, Cas, we've got the codex. That's a start. You know, it'll slow Rowena down some. If we'd killed her, the Book of the Damned would've been lost.

Dean: Besides, we got bigger fish to fry.

Castiel: The Darkness. What does she want?

Dean: Well, the big question is, where the hell is she?

Castiel (gesturing toward deans injuries): Dean, I can fix that.

Dean: No, no, no. No, no. It's fine, Cas. Besides, I had it comin'.

(EXT. Crowley walking through the halls of Hell towards Young Amara’s room.)

Crowley: Hereby command and decree... Blah, blah, blah. Hung on hooks for all eternity... Entrails removed...

(He sees the feet of the new Demon Nanny sticking out from the doorway clearly dead. When he walks into her room he sees a teenaged girl standing in front of the mirror)

Crowley: Amara?

Teenaged Amara: I'm hungry.

Crowley: Of course, Pumpkin. But tell you what, maybe we should have a chat first.

Teenaged Amara: I said I'm hungry.
