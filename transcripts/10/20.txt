TEASER
Scene opens on a typical living room set up. As the camera pans around the room we hear a door opening. Jimmy Novak (dressed in a grey suit and pin striped shirt) enters through the door into the entryway of the house. The camera zooms in on him.

JIMMY

Amelia?

Amelia?!

(The camera turns to a woman at the top of the stairs the leading from the entryway)

AMELIA

Jimmy?

Jimmy?

(Amelia runs ¾ of the way down stairs)

Is it...you?

JIMMY

(Jimmy nods slowly)

Castiel is gone. It's me.

Sorry. I'm so sorry. I never ...

(Amelia runs down the rest of the stairs and hugs Jimmy)

AMELIA

I looked everywhere for you.

I thought I lost you again.

JIMMY

It's okay.

It's okay.

(They end the embrace and Amelia take Jimmy’s face in her hands)

It's...

(Camera pans to Amelia’s forearms resting on Jimmy’s chest. Blood starts to ooze through her shirt on her left arm)

It's okay.

I'm home now.

(Amelia looks down to her forearms, as the bloodstain grows larger)

AMELIA

What's happening?

JIMMY

How's our girl?

How's Claire?

(Jimmy seems oblivious to what is happening to Amelia, as she gets increasingly upset)

AMELIA

No!

Not again! No!

(Scene changes to Amelia strapped to a cot in a dark room. She is wearing a grey tank top and looks worn and haggard. A man in a suit is sitting on the side of the cot with her. She is making whimpering noises and trying to sit up and pull away as the man hold her arm and places something against the crook of her elbow)

MAN

Shh. Shh.

(The man drags a knife across her arm and makes a small incision. Blue light and smokes comes out of the cut and the man inhales the smoke, closing his eyes as he does so)

AMELIA

No! No!

MAN

Shh. Shh.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

shh, shh, shh, shh.

(The man places his hand on Amelia’s cheek. The camera pulls back to show that they are in some type of abandoned building)

You're safe, Amelia.

(Amelia closes her eyes and appears to go to sleep)

You're home.

(We hear Jimmy’s voice while still seeing Amelia sleeping)

JIMMY

Amelia

(Scene changes to Jimmy entering the house from the opening scene and closing the door behind him. He walks into the entryway and looks around)

JIMMY

Amelia?!

(Amelia, dressed as in the first scene, comes down the stairs)

AMELIA

Jimmy?

Is it...you?

(Camera turns to show Jimmy)

JIMMY

(music starts playing)

I'm so sorry.

(Amelia runs down the stairs and hugs Jimmy)

I'm so sorry I left.

(camera pulls back to show Jimmy and Amelia in the entryway. She is holding his face in her hands)

AMELIA

I looked everywhere for you.

(Scene changes to Amelia sleeping in the abandoned building as the man strokes her cheek)

TITLE CARD


ACT ONE
(‘Tulsa, Oklahoma’ appears on the screen. Scene opens at night outside the ‘Lucky Star’ massage parlor. There are two motorcycles parked on the sidewalk. A young girl with blonde hair runs by and enters a door next to the massage parlor as sirens go off in the background. The scene changes to the interior of the bar and we see people playing pool. The camera pans towards the bar and we see the girl (Claire Novak) approach the bar)

(Music in the background)

gonna catch that train at midnight
I don't care where it goes*
FEMALE BARTENDER

The hell you think you're doing in here?

CLAIRE

Come on, it’s my birthday tomorrow.

FEMALE BARTENDER

How old you gonna be? 12?

Hmm.

(Music in the background)

Well, I once had me a good life *
(Claire pulls money out of her pocket and holds it out towards the bartender)

CLAIRE

More like 50.

(Claire lays a $50 dollar bill on the bar)

CLAIRE

I'm looking for a guy named Ronnie Cartwright.

He's supposed to be a regular around here.

(Music in the background)

And my blues is gettin' darker
Oh, lord, I think these blues have been turned black *

(The bartender picks up the money. The scene changes to a man sitting at a table in the bar drinking a beer. Claire approaches from behind and stands alongside the table)

CLAIRE

Ronnie Cartwright?

(Music in the background)

• Yeah, they have *

(The man looks at Claire, turns his head away and sighs)

RONNIE

Whatever you're selling, I ain't buyin', sweetheart.

(Claire sits across from Ronnie at the table)

CLAIRE

I need your help, Ronnie.

I'm trying to track somebody down.

(Claire reaches into her jacket, pulls out a picture of Amelia and lays it on the table facing Ronnie)

(Music in the background)

• And if you're not one of them *

(Ronnie looks at the picture, makes a dismissive face and slides the picture back towards Claire. Claire picks up the picture and looks at it)

RONNIE

I ain't never seen her before in my life.

CLAIRE

Her name's Amelia.

She's been missing for a few years, but according to her diary, she was supposed to meet up with you.

RONNIE

I ain't never met her.

CLAIRE

You were gonna introduce her to some miracle worker.

RONNIE

Look, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

I don't know that lady.

And I for damn sure don't know some miracle worker.

If I did, you think I'd be in a dump like this?

Now piss off. Go back to your Girl Scout troop.

CLAIRE

She's my mother.

RONNIE

I don't care.

CLAIRE

Can you just take another look? I mean, maybe ...

RONNIE

I told you, I ain't never seen her before.

Now I better never see you again.

(Ronnie takes his beer and gets up from the table. Scene changes to the outside of the bar (we see the sign say’s ‘Susie’s’). Ronnie comes out of the door and starts walking. The camera follows him from behind and a hand comes out and grabs his jacket. Ronnie spins round to see Claire standing there)

RONNIE

I told you to stay the hell away from me.

CLAIRE

You were the last person to speak to my mom. I need to find her.

RONNIE

I don't know Amelia Novak. You got it?

CLAIRE

I never told you her last name.

(Ronnie turns to walk/run away and Claire grabs his arm)

Wait!

(Ronnie shoves his arm back to break Claire’s grip and she slams into the wall)

CLAIRE Uhh! (Claire slides to the ground unconscious. Ronnie looks distressed and reaches two fingers to Claire’s neck to feel for a pulse. Breathing heavily, he takes out his cell phone and makes a call))

RONNIE (impatiently)

Come on.

OPERATOR

9-1-1, what is your emergency?

RONNIE

Um, yeah, found some girl passed out in the alley, uh, uh, by Susie's bar on Overland.

OPERATOR

We'll send an ambulance right away, sir.

Can you tell me if she's still breathing?

(Ronnie hangs up the call and runs away)

(Scene changes to daylight, outside the Tulsa Memorial Hospital. Sirens are heard in the background as Castiel paces. He turns as ‘bad ass’ music starts playing. The Impala comes around the corner and pulls up in front of the hospital. Sam and Dean get out of the car in unison and approach Castiel)

CASTIEL

Thanks for coming.

SAM

Yeah, of course.

DEAN

Cas, look, we're always glad to help, but Claire and I aren't exactly on the best of terms. I mean, should I even be here?

CASTIEL

I need help from both of you.

You were both troubled teens. You speak her language.

SAM (smirking)

All right. How is she?

CASTIEL

Well, I-I haven't gone in yet. I was waiting for backup.

DEAN

B-backup?

SAM

Mm. Huh.

DEAN

Three men and a lady. Let's do this.

(Dean starts to walk to the entrance of the hospital. Scene changes to Claire in a hospital bed. She turns her head as Castiel appears in the doorway and walks into the room with Sam and Dean behind him)

CLAIRE (disdainfully)

What are you doing here? And why the hell did you bring him?

DEAN (sarcastically)

Awesome.

CASTIEL

Um, the ... the police found my number in your emergency contact list.

(Sam looks around the room uncomfortably as Dean leans on a cabinet)

CLAIRE

Yeah, well... That was a mistake.

You can go now.

CASTIEL

Claire... Why were you at a bar?

CLAIRE

I wasn't.

(Sam approaches the bed)

SAM

Claire, what were you doing in an alley outside of a bar?

CLAIRE

Wrong place, wrong time. Story of my life.

SAM

Look, we're not leaving until you tell us what the hell really happened. So if you want us gone...Talk.

CLAIRE (looking towards Castiel)

I was looking for my mom. I wanna find my mom and tell her she ruined my life.

CASTIEL

Your mom didn't ...

CLAIRE

She left me, and so did my dad. But Jimmy's gone, right? Has it easy up in heaven. So...Mom's the only one left I can tell off.

SAM

When's the last anybody heard from your mom?

CLAIRE

Um...

When I was living with my grandmother, she used to send me postcards.

(Claire reaches over to a table and takes a package out of her bag)

This is the last one.

(Claire pulls out a post card and hands it to Sam)

I got it just before my grandma died. Two years ago. Nobody's heard from her since. It was sent from a motel here in town.

(Camera shows the front of the card. It says ‘Curtis’ Motor Court above a picture of a rural looking motel)

That's where I've been crashing. I was at Susie's bar looking for a loser named Ronnie Cartwright. Mom's diary said she was gonna meet him around the time she disappeared. Before he knocked me down, he remembered her name. He knows something.

CASTIEL

Why was Amelia looking for him?

CLAIRE

She went looking for miracles. She went looking for you.

(Scene changes to Sam, Dean and Castiel in the hallway of the hospital)

CASTIEL

This is all my fault.

SAM

You know, Cas, say it is. What can you do about it?

CASTIEL

Find Amelia.

DEAN

She did disappear trying to hunt down an angel.

(Shrugging) Might be a case.

SAM

Yeah, but we don't know that.

DEAN

Close enough. Come on, give me something to punch already.

(Castiel and Sam look worriedly at Dean)

DEAN (rolling his eyes) I'm kidding. I'm fine. I'm just...I'm fine.

Why don't we go back to the bar, see if we can track down this Ronnie guy, huh?

SAM

Yeah. We should let Claire know where we're going first.

DEAN

Perfect.

(Dean walks away. The scene changes to inside Claire’s room. Dean is holding a hospital gown and the bed is empty. Sam and Castiel walk into the room)

SAM

Hey.

DEAN (tosses the gown onto a chair)

Damn it. Well... She either went looking for Ronnie again or, uh ...

SAM (holding up the postcard from the motel)

Yeah, or… she went to go grab her stuff before taking off again.

DEAN

Well, she's got a concussion. Maybe that'll slow her down.

SAM

All right. I'll head to the motel. Y'all check out the bar.

(Scene changes to the Impala driving down a road at nighttime in the rain. Castiel and Dean are in the Impala)

DEAN

Hey, Cas, listen, what you're doing for Claire and helping her find her mom...

It's good. It's a good thing.

CASTIEL

But?

DEAN

Well, where does it end? I'm not trying to be a dick, but truth is, you're not her dad.

In fact, you're not anything to her expect a-a constant reminder of someone that's gone.

CASTIEL

No, I'm...

Responsible for everything that's happened to her.

DEAN

Look, I'm just saying,she's been surviving on her own for quite a while now, and ... and then partly because she doesn't have anybody to answer to.

You know, there's... There's nobody holding her back.

CASTIEL

We just found her in a hospital. You telling me that she'd be better off on her own?

DEAN

I'm saying she might be stronger on her own.

(Scene changes Dean and Castiel standing at a bar. They appear to be talking to the bartender.)

(music playing in the background)

• for all those pretty things *

(Dean and Castiel turn away from the bar and walk over to Ronnie who’s sitting at a booth with a beer. Ronnie sees them and tries to run. Dean grabs him and slides into the booth next to him)

DEAN

Yeah! What's the rush, huh? Heading out to beat down another teenager?

(Castiel is sitting across the table from Ronnie)

RONNIE

That bitch attacked me!

(Dean grabs Ronnie by his jacket and slams his head against the table. Castiel looks worriedly around the bar. Ronnie picks his head up off the bar)

DEAN

Poor choice of words, pal.

Now...Amelia Novak. Where is she?

No?

(Dean slams Ronnie’s head against the table again)

RONNIE

Uhh!

CASTIEL (in a warning tone)

Dean.

DEAN

Listen, Ronnie, what do you say, huh?

(Ronnie picks his head up again)

We could do this all day, unless you wanna tell me everything you know about Amelia.

RONNIE

Okay. Okay.

(Dean pulls his hands off Ronnie in an exaggerated manner)

I met Amelia. But she was the last one, I swear.

CASTIEL

Last one of what?

RONNIE

I worked for a faith healer.

(Dean and Castiel look at each other skeptically)

No, he was the real deal.

Hey, I was blind. He healed me.

DEAN

Give us a name. (Deans slams his hand on the table) Now!

RONNIE

Peter Holloway.

DEAN

Okay.

Yeah, after he gave me my sight back, I...

Well, me made me work for him as...payment.

I-I-I recruited candidates.

Yeah, he had...A specific type.

Young but, uh...

Lost. Wouldn't be missed.

CASTIEL

Amelia was one of these "candidates"?

RONNIE

Some people, he healed. But others, he, uh...

Oh, man.

Look, I saw him one night. It looked like he was, uh...

I don't know ... I don't know how to describe it, but he was...

He tied one of 'em up and... He ... he ... he was, uh... cutting on them.

Look, after that, I was done.

Okay? I quit.

I haven't heard from Holloway since.

(Scene changes to Dean and Castiel getting in the Impala outside the bar. As the Impala pulls away Ronnie comes out into the street and pulls out his cell phone)

(Scene changes to Claire opening a door into a motel room. We see her over Sam’s shoulder, who is sitting in a chair in the room)

SAM

Took you long enough.

(Claire turns, startled)

CLAIRE

How did you...

(Sam holds up the post card)

SAM

Also, you checked in under the name "Claire Novak."

A little pro-tip? Use an alias.

CLAIRE

Okay.

(Claire opens a closet and starts to pull out some clothes)

SAM

Claire, we just wanna help.

CLAIRE

I didn't ask for your help.

(Claire walks past Sam and he turns her way. He looks over his shoulder at a wall that is covered with maps, photos and papers)

SAM

You know, this is good. I was impressed. How did you get the information that...

(Claire tosses a book to Sam)

CLAIRE

It's mostly empty promises and regret, but... There were enough breadcrumbs to get me here.

(Sam looks through the book as Claire packs her bags)

SAM

How did you get your mom's diary?

CLAIRE

The motel manager sent mom's stuff to her last known address after she disappeared. It bounced around, eventually found its way to me at one of the foster homes.

SAM

You came all this way just to tell her off?

CLAIRE

You always get along with your mom?

SAM

Never got the chance to find out. My mom died when I was a baby.

CLAIRE

I'm ... I'm sorry. I didn't ...

SAM

Oh, no, it's okay. I-I got to know her later in life. And, yeah, I suppose we got along okay.

CLAIRE

What?

SAM

In this line of work, death isn't always good-bye.

CLAIRE

This is different.

(Claire walks across the hotel room to get another bag by the sink)

My mom left me.

SAM (reading from up a piece of paper)

"Claire, I'll be home soon. We'll be home soon." Doesn't sound like somebody who wanted to abandon you.

Did you check her credit cards?

CLAIRE

They wouldn't send me her records.

SAM

Okay, I know you need to be somewhere far away from all of us, but let me get my laptop. I'll teach you how to hack into her credit card records.

It'll help you get a lead on your mom.

CLAIRE

Show me, but then I'm gone.

(Scene changes to Ronnie looking at his cell phone and pacing nervously outside Suzie’s bar, sirens blare in the background. His phone rings and he answers)

RONNIE

Hey, listen, I don't think these guys snooping around are F.B.I. You know, I-I think they're ...

(VOICE BEHIND RONNIE)

…they're hunters.

RONNIE (turning around)

I-I'm sorry. I-I wanted to give you the heads up.

(the camera turns to the man that was with Amelia in the opening scenes)

MAN

Wouldn't need a heads up if you kept your mouth shut, Ronnie.

(The man puts two fingers on Ronnie’s forehead)

RONNIE

Hey, come on.

MAN

Don't you see that?

RONNIE

Come on. No. W...my eyes! Come on, man! I can't see!

(Ronnie turns around and the man stabs him though the back with a blade that looks like and angel blade.)

RONNIE

Uhh!

(He withdraws the blade and Ronnie falls forward to the ground. The man turns around and walks away.)


ACT TWO
(Scene changes back to the hotel room with Sam and Claire. We see Sam’s hands gesturing in front of his laptop.)

SAM

There we go.

CLAIRE (walking over to Sam at the table with his laptop)

Seriously? It's that easy?

SAM

Yes. I can also show you how to set up fake credit cards. It will make life on the road a lot easier.

CLAIRE

You guys are credit card scammers, too?

SAM

Yeah. Hunting monsters doesn't exactly pay the bills.

CLAIRE

Then why do you do it?

SAM

To help people, make a difference.

CLAIRE

That's it?

SAM

That's not enough?

(Knocking on the door. Claire opens the door and Castiel is there)

CASTIEL

Are you all right?

CLAIRE (frustrated)

Yeah, I will be when nobody ever asks me that again.

SAM

You guys find Ronnie?

(Dean comes up behind Castiel and they both enter the room)

DEAN

Yeah.

Yeah, he gave up a name ...Peter Holloway.

Said he was a faith healer.

(Claire sits on the bed and smirks. Dean sits at the table with Sam. Castiel looks on)

SAM

So...What? You thinking angel?

DEAN

Maybe, but it sounded like he has healed some people, but he may have fed off others.

SAM

Yeah, that's weird.

All right, let's look into this Peter Holloway guy.

(Castiel walks over to Claire with a brightly covered gift bag in his hand. Dean is at the table in the background covering his eyes with his hand)

CASTIEL

Claire, um...

Happy Birthday.

(Castiel hands Claire the gift bag)

CLAIRE

Um...

(Claire pulls a plush cat out of the bag)

CASTIEL

I got it at the Hot Topical.

(Sam and Dean raise their eyebrows at each other)

CLAIRE

Right.

Um...Thanks, I guess.

(Claire puts the cat back in the bag and tosses it on the bed behind her)

SAM

Whoa. Just got an alert from local P.D.

Ronnie's body was just found outside of Susie's bar.

CLAIRE

You were just supposed to talk to Ronnie.

What did you do to him?

DEAN (defensively)

I didn't lay a hand on him.

CASTIEL

Dean, that isn't exactly true.

(Sam looks around questioningly)

DEAN

I didn't kill the guy.

DEAN (standing up from the table)

All right, I'm gonna get suited up and head back over there.

CASTIEL

I'm coming with you.

CLAIRE

I'm coming with you, too.


DEAN (turning towards Sam)

You wanna get in on this?

SAM

No, I-I should probably stay here and research Holloway.

DEAN

Right.

(Dean strides out the door and Claire follows. Sam looks to see that Dean is out of the room ands turns to Castiel)

SAM

Hey, Cas? What happened at the bar?

CASTIEL (sighing)

Dean snapped. He's getting worse.

(Castiel leaves the hotel room and Sam looks worried. Scene changes to outside Suzie’s bar where police photographers are taking pictures Ronnie’s body. Dean (in a suit), Castiel and Claire approach the scene and the female police officer)

DEAN

Officer? Agents Clapton and Page.

OFFICER

And your little friend?

DEAN

Oh. Uh...Yeah.

It's "bring your daughter to work" day at the Bureau.

Uh, vic was a, uh, person of interest in a missing persons case.

What do you got?

OFFICER

Stab wound. Clean through.

(The group moves closer to the body)

No sign of robbery. Wallet and everything was still on his person.

DEAN

What are the red marks there on the point of entry?

(Camera turns to show Ronnie’s lower back covered in blood. There is a large triangular hole where the blade pierced his skin. Below the hole, on either side are two small, circular holes)

OFFICER

Burn marks, maybe. Don’t know.

(Claire grimaces and turns her head)

OFFICER

We pulled his cell phone records. He made two calls to the same number prior to the attack. Tried the number, but the line's dead now. Probably a burner.

DEAN

Mm.

(Phone ringing)

OFFICER

Will you excuse me?

(The officer walks away to answer her phone)

DEAN

Yeah.

OFICER

Sheriff Coltrane. Uh-huh.

CASTIEL

The wound looks like an angel blade, but the point of entry is wider.

Can't explain those marks.

(Officers cover Ronnie’s body with a blanket as Claire looks on)

CLAIRE

Best birthday ever.

DEAN (leading Castiel and Claire away from the scene)

Okay, all right, come here.

(Scene changes to the hotel room where Sam is writing on a note pad. Dean, Castiel and Claire walk through the door.)

SAM

Hey. I, uh, got a lead on Peter Holloway.

DEAN (leaning on the back of a chair at the table)

Oh, good, 'cause he's probably about to split town.

Ronnie made a few phone calls before he got shish kebabed.

SAM

You think to give Holloway a heads up?

DEAN

If he did, that's probably what got him killed.

So...We gotta track him down before he bails.

SAM

Great. Well, according to county records, Holloway owns a farmhouse about 30 or 40 miles from here, so I, uh, cross-referenced it with Amelia's credit card receipts.

(Sam gets up from his chair and moves towards the wall with Claire’s research on it. He points to a spot on a map)

The house is about right there, and she's been hitting up Biggersons and Gas n' Sips all around the area.

DEAN

Probably staking the place out.

SAM

Exactly.

CLAIRE

Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go.

CASTIEL

Claire, you are not going out there.

CLAIRE

She's my mother.

CASTIEL

That house could be empty and it could be a trap.

It's too dangerous. I can't let anything happen to you.

CLAIRE

Anything else you mean.

CASTIEL

Claire, you're not going.

CASTIEL

You're not either, Dean.

DEAN (looking surprised)

What?

CASTIEL

Back at the bar with Ronnie?

DEAN

Oh, come on, Cas. He wasn't gonna talk. I just... Helped him talk.

SAM (walking towards Dean)

Dean, Cas is right. We need to keep the Mark in check.

And we don't know what's out there.

You know, maybe you should... Maybe you should stay here.

DEAN

So you wanna bench me again?

SAM (sighing)

Hmm.

DEAN

(Dean looks at Castiel and pauses for several seconds)

All right. Fine. I'll stay and babysit.

(Dean turns towards Sam)

But if anything happens, anything at all...

CASTIEL (wearily)

Yeah, we'll call you.

No fighting.

DEAN (scoffs)

Yeah, tell her that.

CASTIEL (sternly)

Both of you.

(Dean makes a ‘who me’ face as Castiel and Sam walk out the hotel room door. Claire smirks at him.)

(Scene changes to Dean (now in ‘hunter attire’ grabbing a beer out of a six pack on the hotel table. He pulls off the top and tosses it into the hotel sink as he sits down. Sighing, he takes a sip of his beer)

CLAIRE

Can I have one?

Like you never had a beer before you were 21.

DEAN (rolling his eyes)

All right. You know what? If we stay cooped up in this motel room all night long, I'm gonna lose my mind.

CLAIRE

Spoiler alert ... you already have.

DEAN (laughs sarcastically)

That's... Come on. Let's go.

(Dean and Claire leave the hotel room. Scene changes to Sam and Castiel driving in the Impala down a dark road. )

CASTIEL

When this is over, should I... Should I leave Claire alone?

SAM

What? No, man. She's family. Well, I mean, she's not exactly family, but she's close enough.

I mean, you two have history. Simple as that.

CASTIEL

So do you think she's better off on her own?

Cas, she just turned 18.

CASTIEL

You were alone when you left for college at that age, weren't you?

SAM

Yeah, but that's different.

CASTIEL

How, Sam?

SAM

Here's all I know ... going it alone, that's no way to live. You being there for her, even if she thinks she doesn't want you to be there for her, that's good for both of you.

CASTIEL

Maybe, in the end.

SAM

In the end.

(Scene changes to Claire and Dean playing mini-golf. Dean strikes a red ball and we see the ball’s perspective as it rolls down the green, bounces off the wall and sinks into the hole.)

DEAN It's in the hole! It's in the hole!

Bill Murray? "Caddyshack."

It's a classic.

CLAIRE

Never seen it. Not a fan.

DEAN (looking offended)

How dare you.

CLAIRE

You done?

DEAN

Yeah, I'm done.

I'm done with your whole generation.

(Claire takes the same shot and we see her ball sink right into the hole as well. Dean turns his head and looks away)

CLAIRE

Did you ... did you see that? Did that go in the hole?

I wasn't watching. Did the ball go in the hole?

DEAN

"Happy Gilmore."

Well played.

CLAIRE (taking a little bow)

Thank you. Mm.

DEAN

Yep. Did that go in? Did that go in?

(Scene changes to Sam and Castiel in the Impala, looking out the front windshield at something)

CASTIEL

It looks abandoned.

(Sam and Castiel get out of the car)

SAM

Only one way to find out.

(Scene changes back to Dean and Claire playing mini-golf. Claire takes another swing as Dean looks on)

CLAIRE

This is what you guys do? Stay at cheap motels, steal credit cards... Play mini-golf?

DEAN

Actually, we haven't played mini-golf in a while. But, uh... Yeah. That about sums it up.

(Scene changes to Sam and Castiel outside the abandoned building. They are at the back of the Impala with the trunk open. Sam is loading his gun)

SAM

You take the barn, I'll take the house.

(Sam closes the trunk and they walk towards the barn. Scene changes back to Dean and Claire playing mini-golf. Dean is taking a swing)

DEAN

We help people. At least, we try to.

(Dean and Claire are walking towards the next hole, Claire behind Dean)

CLAIRE

Like, uh, Castiel helped my dad?

DEAN

Claire, what happened to your dad...I'm sorry, okay? I really am.

But, uh, there's something you gotta know.

(They stop walking and Dean turns towards Claire)

Your dad's sacrifice was not meaningless.

Yeah, he gave up his body, his ... his vessel.

And because he did that, Cas... Cas was able to save the world.


The world.

Your father's a hero. He did not die in vain.

(Claire sighs and walks past Dean to line up the next hole. She swings and the ball goes into the hole)

CLAIRE

Last hole.

DEAN

Already?

CLAIRE (Walking toward the hole)

Yeah. See? They take your ball on the last one. Drop it in the bottom like so.

(Claire turns her golf club upside down and drops it into the hole. The club falls into the hole until the club end gets stuck. Dean, staring intently at the club in the hole walks slowly towards it. He bends down and grabs the club end)

CLAIRE

You okay? You're not stroking out, are you?

DEAN (looking up at Claire)

The red marks.

CLAIRE

What red marks?

(Dean stands up, hands the club to Claire)

DEAN

Claire, you're a genius.

DEAN

Come on, let's go.

(Dean walks quickly away, Claire follows)

CLAIRE

What? Wait. Why am I a genius?

(Scene changes to Dean and Claire sitting at the hotel table. Dean is bringing up images on the laptop and Claire is turning pages in a book)

CLAIRE

So this is hunting? Homework?

DEAN

Cas said that Ronnie's wound looked like an angel blade, but the red marks didn't match up with an angel blade.

(We see a black and white image on the laptop screen that looks like a man-like creature attacking a man in a forest)

But if it was an angel sword that would explain the size of the wound and the red marks.

(a black & white image of drawings of various swords/blades is shown on the laptop)

'Cause a sword would have a hilt on it, which could cause the ... the marks.

CLAIRE

You got all that from a putter?

(Scene changes to Sam walking into the kitchen of the abandoned house. It’s dark and he has his gun drawn, searching for threats. He pulls an angel blade out of his coat and continues to search. Scene changes to Castiel walking through the barn. Scene changes again to Claire’s hands turning pages in a book. She stops on a color picture of an angel with a long blade. Dean looks over)

CLAIRE

Is ... is this what you mean?

DEAN

Grigori.

(Scene changes back to Sam walking through the house gun drawn and ready walking away from the kitchen doorway. We hear Dean say ‘The watcher angels’ as Holloway appears in the shadows of the open doorway. Scene changes back to Dean and Claire at the hotel)

CLAIRE

So are they good or bad?

DEAN

Well, some of the lore says that they, uh, they help people, and some says that they prey on people.

So...Keep digging.

ACT THREE
(Scene changes to Castiel in the barn. He comes around a corner looking nervous/frightened. Scene changes to Amelia sleeping/unconscious on the cot. Castiel is seen out of focus on the other side of the room. He runs over to Amelia and sits beside her on the cot)

CASTIEL

Amelia.

(Scene changes to Amelia running down the stairs as in the opening scene)

AMELIA

Jimmy?!

(Scene changes to the barn where Castiel is untying the restraints on Amelia’s wrists and then helps her sit up)

CASTIEL

Oh.

(Scene changes back to Amelia in the house. She is at the bottom of the steps looking around the entryway)

AMELIA

Jimmy!

(Scene changes back to Amelia laying on the cot)

CASTIEL

Amelia.

(Scene changes back to the house where a frightened Amelia is looking around the entryway)

AMELIA

Jimmy!

(Scene changes back to the barn as Amelia’s eyes snap open)

CASTIEL

Amelia.

(Amelia looks up and realizes that Castiel is with her. She gets angry and starts hitting at him. As she’s punching, Castiel tries to grab her wrists)

AMELIA

I looked everywhere for you!

CASTIEL

It's okay.

AMELIA

I tried to find you!

CASTIEL

No. Hey, hey.

Hey.

AMELIA

You took my husband!

(Castiel embraces Amelia and holds on to her until she collapses against him and stops fighting)

CASTIEL

Shh. Shh. It's okay.

It's okay.

(Scene changes Sam walking through the house with gun and Angel blade ready. His phone vibrates and he pulls it out of his pocket to see ‘Dean Calling’. He sighs and then hears a creak from behind him. He turns and Holloway strikes him with some sort of club.

SAM

Uhh!

(Sam falls to the floor, unconscious)


(Dean and Claire are at the hotel. Dean is on his cell phone)

DEAN

Cas isn't answering his phone either.

(Dean grabs his duffel and walks across the room)

CLAIRE

I don't understand. Grigori angels went rogue? Started feeding on people? Why?

DEAN

(checks his gun and puts it in his waistband)

Don't know, don't care.

I'm heading over to Holloway's to end that son of a bitch.

CLAIRE

Yeah, let me guess. You want me to stay here?

(Dean turns and considers Claire for a few moments. He turns to his duffel, pulls outs a revolver and hands it to Claire)

DEAN

Happy Birthday. Don't shoot me.

Let's go.

(Scene changes to the barn where Castiel has two fingers placed on Amelia’s forehead. He pulls his hand away as Amelia looks at her arms. Castiel places his hand over her forearm, which has several cuts on it, and a light glows from his hand)

CASTIEL

Sorry.

I'm usually able to heal any wound. You...

AMELIA (tearfully)

I was dreaming. This whole time, I was dreaming... of finding Jimmy, of putting my family back together.

You're not him anymore. I can tell.

CASTIEL

No.

AMELIA

Where's Jimmy?

CASTIEL

Your husband is in heaven. Amelia, I promised to protect your family, and I failed.

AMELIA

Not if Claire's alive. She's all that matters.

CASTIEL

Claire is alive. She's grown up to be a very strong-willed young woman.

AMELIA

Oh, that's my girl. I just ... I shouldn't have ever left her.

I-I thought if I could find Jimmy, I would make everything right. But I should've never left her.

I shouldn't ... I shouldn't...

(Amelia breaks down crying and Castiel embraces her)

CASTIEL

It's okay.

(Scene changes to the house where Sam is handcuffed to a chair, head hanging down before regaining consciousness)

SAM

Huh.

(Sam looks around the kitchen as he struggles with the handcuffs. Holloway walks into the room)

SAM

You must be Holloway.

(Holloway walks across the kitchen over to Sam)

HOLLOWAY

For the last 50 years or so, yes. Before that, I was a Jenkins. And before that, a Miller. My real name is Tamiel.

(Scene changes to the back of the chair and Sam’s hands in handcuffs. He is pulling a nail out of the wooden chair with his thumbs)

HOLLOWAY

I'm a Grigori. A watcher angel.

SAM

Since when do angels feed on humans?

HOLLOWAY

Since the dawn of man.

SAM

What are you talking about?

HOLLOWAY

Your souls...

(Holloway walks behind Sam and Sam hides the nail in his hands)

Are little slices of heaven that are, if properly kept, delicious meals that can last for years, decades even.

SAM

You're not an angel. You're a monster.

(Holloway laughs and reaches out to lightly punch Sam on the shoulder)

HOLLOWAY

Ahh.

(We see Sam’s hands using the nail to open the handcuffs)

I prefer to think of myself as a gourmand. I make heaven a place on earth. Keeps me alive and hidden from the rest of the failures that call themselves angels.

SAM

Oh, they are failures?

Yeah, 'cause you're living so large in your own life.

(Holloway turns around quickly and draws his sword on Sam so that it is pointing directly at Sam’s face)

HOLLOWAY

There were hundreds of us, but now...

(Holloway raises the sword up to show an inscription on the blade)

Each of our names inscribed on our swords.

A brotherhood of perfectly crafted, engineered beings sent to protect you pathetic, bottom-feeding disasters.

(Scene changes to Dean and Claire walking outside the house and barn, guns drawn)

DEAN

All right, let's stick together. First the barn, then the house.

If you have to shoot, aim for the chest.

It won't drop an angel, but it'll slow him down. Got it?

CLAIRE

Yeah.

(Scene changes to inside the barn, Castiel is looking other bodies that are in the room with Amelia)

AMELIA

Are they...

CASTIEL

I don't know. We will get them help.

AMELIA

How long have I been like this?

CASTIEL

Two years.

(Scene changes to Dean and Claire walking through the barn on the same path as Castiel. They come to a corner and Deans turns quickly, gun drawn and aims at Castiel who has come out of the room with Amelia and the bodies. Castiel puts his hands out defensively)

CASTIEL

Dean.

(Claire runs past Castiel and into the room. She stops when she sees Amelia)

AMELIA

Claire?

I'm so sorry. (Claire runs to Amelia and they embrace)

AMELIA (crying)

Baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry!

CLAIRE

Okay. Okay.

(Claire kneels down as Amelia sits back on the cot. Dean and Castiel walk into the room. Dean looks at the girls and then at Castiel with a confused look on his face)

DEAN (to Castiel)

Let's go find Sam.

(Dean walks over and kneels beside Claire)

Claire, hey.

CLAIRE

Oh.

DEAN

Listen to me. Stay here, okay?

Do not move.

CLAIRE (crying)

Okay.

Thank you. Thank you, both.

(Dean and Castiel leave the room and Claire turns back to Amelia)

CLAIRE

Hey, Mom.

Mommy.

(Scene changes to a close up of the chair Sam was in, overturned on the kitchen floor, open handcuffs hanging from it. On the other side of the room, Dean walks in, gun drawn, and looks around. Castiel is behind him. Dean continues walking and stops when he sees the chair)

DEAN

Cas.

(Something creaks in the other room and Dean and Castiel walk towards it. As Dean turns the corner into the room Sam comes out, club raised and ready to swing. Dean gasps, pauses and rolls his eyes.)

DEAN

What the hell happened?

SAM

Listen, Holloway is a...

SAM/DEAN (Simultaneously)

Grigori. Grigori.

CASTIEL

Grigori?

SAM

Yes.

CASTIEL

No.

They were some of the first angels on earth.

It was an elite unit that went bad.

But they're ... they're extinct. They were destroyed.

SAM

Well, no, some survived. And they've been hunting humans, making them create heavens in their minds and feeding off them.

CASTIEL

Where is this abomination?

SAM

I don't know. I looked everywhere. He must've left.

(Dean looks at Castiel and runs out of the room. Castiel and Sam follow)

(Scene changes to Claire and Amelia in the barn. Claire is looking out the doorway worriedly. Behind her Amelia is collapsing on the cot. Claire turns and goes to her)

CLAIRE

Mom. Come on.

Mom, you have to stay with me, okay? Come on. Stand up.

(Claire helps Amelia stand up, pulls her arm over her shoulders and they start walking)

Mom, it's gonna be okay.

AMELIA

Okay.

Thank you, sweetheart.

Yeah.

(As they walk Holloway appears in front of them)

HOLLOWAY

You know there's no fixing her, right?

(Claire drops Amelia and aims her gun at Holloway. She shoots him four times in the chest. On the fifth shot the gun clicks, as if it’s empty. Claire shoots several more times with the same result. Holloway shakes his head and walks towards Claire, Angel sword in hand)

HOLLOWAY

You really think that's gonna hurt an angel of the Lord?

(Holloway moves to strike Claire and Amlia jumps in between them)

AMELIA

No! Aah!

(Holloway stabs Amelia straight through the chest and then pulls out the sword. Amelia falls to the ground and Claire kneels behind her, holding her up. Holloway looks on, smirking)

CLAIRE (crying)

Mom! Mom! Mom!

ACT FOUR
(Claire is holding Amelia in her arms as blood stains her shirt and drips out of her mouth. Holloway looks on with disdain and raises his sword)

CASTIEL

No!

(Castiel runs in and knocks Holloway to the ground. He pulls out his Angel blade and they struggle on the ground. Holloway knocks Castiel to the side and stands up as Sam runs in and grabs him from behind, locking his arms behind him. Dean runs and punches Holloway as Sam holds him. The fight continues for several seconds with Castiel’s Angel blade changing hands several times. Eventually Dean and Cas are down and Sam is thrown against a wall. Holloway raises his sword, laughs and prepares to stab Castiel. Before he can inflict the blow a blade pierces his chest from behind. White light emanates from the wound and his eyes as he screams. He falls forward and Claire is standing behind him. She throws the Angel blade to the ground and runs over to Amelia)


CLAIRE (crying and holding Amelia in her arms. Amelia is unresponsive)

Mom? Mommy, please stay with me, okay? Mom? Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Mom, I'm sorry.

(Scene changes to the front door of Amelia’s ‘dream’ house. It’s bright outside the door. Amelia walks through the door, unhurt and closes the door. Jimmy appears at the top of the stairs)

JIMMY (walking down the stairs)

Amelia.

Amelia.

(They meet each other in the entryway)

AMELIA

Jimmy? Is it really you?

(Jimmy and Amelia embrace)

Is this...

JIMMY

It's heaven.

(They pull away and look around at the house)

JIMMY

I...waited for you for so long. I...

How was she?

How's Claire?

AMELIA (Smiling)

Oh, Jimmy, she grew up so beautiful. She's so strong.

JIMMY

Like her mom.

I love you.

AMELIA

I love you, too.

(They embrace again and Jimmy is crying over Amelia’s shoulder)


(It’s daylight outside the hotel. Sam and Claire are leaning on the trunk of the Impala)

CLAIRE

So, what? This is some sort of halfway house for wayward girls?

SAM

No. Not at all.

Jody Mills is good people, and she'll give you a place to crash until you get back on your feet.

It's not forever, right?

(Dean and Castiel are standing several feet away. Dean looks over his shoulder towards Sam and Claire and then back to Castiel)

DEAN

What are you gonna do about Claire?

CASTIEL

It's not up to me.

CLAIRE

You said sometimes death isn't always good-bye, right?

So good-byes aren't always forever.

SAM

Right. Take care of yourself, Claire.

(Sam walks away and Dean walks over to the Impala. He takes a wrapped package out of the front seat and hands it to Claire)

DEAN

I felt bad about taking the gun back, so...

(Claire opens the package and finds a DVD of ‘Caddy Shack’)

CLAIRE

Thanks.

(Under the DVD is a large book titled ‘The Enochian Myth’)

But I don't think I'm interested in any more homework.

(She hands the book back to Dean)

DEAN

Huh.

(Dean kneels down, opens Claire’s duffel and pulls out the Angel sword)

Do you honestly think I didn't see you take this?

(Dean then takes out the plush cat Castiel gave Claire)

Really?

(Dean puts the book in Claire’s duffel)

I'll just put this in here.

You know, Claire... (Dean stands up)

You already got your revenge.

You go down this path ...our path...(nodding towards Sam)

It's not a long life.

CLAIRE

I don't know. You seem pretty old.

DEAN

Thanks.

CLAIRE

Listen... What I did, setting you up, um...

I'm sorry. I just ... I shouldn't ...

DEAN

Forget it. It's in the past.

CLAIRE

Are you gonna be okay?

DEAN

Me?

I don't know.

But I will keep fighting.

I'll keep swinging until I got nothing left.

CLAIRE

Will you keep an eye on him?

(Dean and Claire look over at Castiel who is talking with Sam)

He's been through enough.

DEAN

So have you.

Claire, do your homework before you do anything stupid, okay?

And we're here if you need us, any time.

(A cab pulls up to Dean and Claire)

I'll get you loaded up.

CASTIEL

Um, Claire.

If you, um, if you...need anything, ever, I'm ... I'm ... just wanted you to know that...

(Claire reaches forward and hugs Castiel)

(singing as Claire walks over to the cab)

In the twilight glow
I seen her *

blue eyes crying in the rain *
When we kissed good-bye *
CASTIEL (looking over towards the cab)

Someone just tell me she's gonna be okay.

SAM

Yeah, Cas. Of course.

She'll be okay.

Meet again *
So will you.

CAB DRIVER (pulling away from the hotel)

Going home or leaving home?

Love is like *
CLAIRE

Just...going.

(Castiel is seen standing in the background for several seconds as the cab continues to pull away)

a dying ember *
and only memories remain *
and through the ages
I'll remember *

blue eyes crying in the rain *
