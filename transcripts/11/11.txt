TEASER
A record is spinning on a record player. A hand reaches over and places the needle on the record. A caption on the screen says

‘Count Cork, Ireland 30 Years Ago’

[ The Shirelles' ‘Will You Love Me Tomorrow? Plays]

[The camera pulls back to show a man in the living room of a house. He’s wearing pajamas and a robe while snapping his fingers and dancing around the room to the music. Through a window we see that it’s raining outside. Behind him a woman carrying a briefcase enters the door.]

♪Tonight you're mine completely ♪

WOMAN

Padraic? Oh, what are you doing?

♪ You give your love so sweetly ♪

[Padraic looks across the room]

PADRAIC

She loves this song.

[Padraic and the woman look over at a baby laying in a crib and smile]

♪ Tonight the light ♪

It's the only thing that will put her to sleep.

♪ of love is in your eyes ♪

Oh, besides...

[Padraic twirls the woman around and they start dancing]

♪ But will you love me ♪

This is our song.

♪ Tomorrow ♪

WOMAN

It's good to see you smiling, mo chuisle.

♪ Is this a lasting treasure? ♪

PADRAIC

I'm trying, Maura.

I'm trying.

[ We hear crying and the camera pans to the baby crying in her crib. Alongside the crying there is a high-pitched scream. Padriac squeezes his eyes shut as if in pain.]

PADRAIC

Ohh! Do you hear that?

WOMAN

[ Scoffs]

That would be our daughter.

[ Crying continues]

PADRAIC

No. I hear...

A scream.

[ Scream intensifies]

It's [Padraic grabs his head and bends over in pain] -- ohh!

Ohh! Ohh!

WOMAN

Hold on, Padraic!

Just hold on!

[The woman runs across the room and grabs a tray with some bottle on it from a cupboard and puts it in a table. The man turns around and is bleeding from his eyes and nose. He is still holding his head in both hands and groaning]

[ Screaming continues]

PADRAIC

[ Whimpering]

Get it out of my head!

[The woman grabs a bowl, drops it on the table and starts emptying the contents of some of the bottles from the tray into the bowl.

PADRAIC

[ Groaning]

[Grunting. Padraic starts banging his head against the wall as a spirit with glowing eyes and mouth, wearing a red dress appears behind him]

WOMAN

Hold on!

[The spirit growls and flies towards Padraic while the woman continues mixing]

[Padraic]

Aah!

[ Padraic grunting]

Ugh!

[Padraic knocks himself unconscious and falls backwards onto a table. The spirit hovers with her face directly over his head, a long, thin tongue slithering towards Padraic’s face]

WOMAN

Get away from him!

[Snarling, the spirit looks at the woman, waves an arm and the woman flies backwards into a piece of furniture, breaking the glass doors]

Oh!

[The baby cries out and the spirit raises her head from the man to look in the direction of the baby. The spirit flies over to the baby while the woman crawls across the floor towards the table. She picks up a piece of the broken glass]

WOMAN

No!

[The woman makes a slice on her writ with the broken glass and hold it over the bowl. As her blood drips onto the powders in the bowl there is a flash of bright light and the spirit vaporizes and disappears. The baby stops crying an looks around. The woman, her face cut and bloodied, pulls herself up the side of the crib and looks at the baby.]

WOMAN

Shh.

[The baby starts to cry again]

It'll be okay, sweet.

It'll be o...Kay.

[The woman collapses to the floor]

[Thud]

[Crying continues]


ACT ONE
[Sam is lying in his bed, tossing and turning. Lucifer’s voice is heard off screen]

LUCIFER

When your brother was trapped in Purgatory you were here with a girl and a dog.

You can't win this, Sam. You're just not strong enough.

You didn't even bother trying to find him.

And I know that if you're gonna beat the Darkness, you have to be ready to watch the people you love die.

[Sam opens his eyes and bolts upright. Switch to Sam, dressed in plaid, standing at a table, cleaning weapons. Dean enters the room behind him wearing his ‘dead guys’ robe and holding a newspaper.]

DEAN

Hey.

SAM

Hey.

DEAN

[Walking over to Sam]

How long you been up?

SAM

I don't know.

DEAN

You okay?

SAM

Yeah, I'm fine.

DEAN

Are you sure?

'Cause you haven't left the bunker in days.

[Gun clicks]

SAM [tersely, with his back to Dean]

I'm fine.

DEAN

Well, good. 'Cause I think I found us a case.

[Dean looks at the paper]

DEAN

Harold Miller, 65.

[The newspaper has a picture of a man with a graying moustache under the headline ‘Retiree found slain’

A resident of Oak Park, an old folks' home, was found yesterday in his room with his head bashed in.

But get this -- the doors were locked and there was no sign of break-in.

[Sam does not respond and continues to look at the gun in his hand]

DEAN

Ghost? Demonic possession?

[Dean smirks, rolls his eyes and walks around to face Sam, who is still cleaning the gun]

DEAN

I figure it's worth a look. What do you think?

Oh, and best part is, Oak Park is 15 minutes from here.

[Smiling]

It's in our backyard.

SAM

And what about the Darkness?

What about Cas? We haven't heard from them.

DEAN

Okay, first of all, we've got zero on Amara.

And Cas -- Cas will be fine.

He always is.

[Lucifer/Cas is standing at the edge of a lake, feeding the birds. The birds are squawking. He walks over to a bench and sits down, crossing his legs and smiling. He looks over to the playground where children are playing and sighs contentedly. A man in a gray suit walks over to another bench. He looks around nervously before sitting down. Cas/Lucifer gets up and walks towards a nature path; the man gets up and follows him.

Lucifer/Cas is walking down the path, whistling. He comes to a stop in front of a giant tree. The man in the suit comes up behind him and pulls out an angel blade]

LUCIFER/CAS

All the parks in the world, and I pick one with an angel in it.

[He turns towards the angel]

ANGEL

I saw you. Couldn't believe my eyes.

LUCIFER/CAS

[winks at the angel]

Well, believe them.

It's beautiful out here, isn't it?

It's funny.

The things you think you're not gonna miss at all, you end up missing the very, very most.

ANGEL [advancing on Cas/Lucifer]

Enjoy it while you can.

[Cas/Lucifer raises his hands as if in surrender]

LUCIFER/CAS

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I come in peace, brother.

ANGEL

I am not your brother, Lucifer.

Well, I'm not looking for a fight.

In fact, I am your only hope at beating the Darkness.

I heard you, uh... Heard you kids had your big shot at the title, and you missed it. [Cas/Lucifer winces and places a hand on the angels shoulder]

LUCIFER/CAS

You don't need to be afraid, brother.

I am out of that awful, awful cage.

And I'm here to save you all.

Lucifer ex machina.

ANGEL

It cannot be destroyed.

[The angel raises his blade to stab Cas/Lucifer]

LUCIFER/CAS

But you can be!

[Cas/Lucifer rolls his eyes with a bored expression, snaps his fingers and the angel explodes, splattering Cas/Lucifer with blood]

Ugh.

That's the problem with you rank-and-file angels -- no vision.

[He wipes some blood off his face with his hand and then licks his fingers]

Hmm.

Hmm.

[Johnny Mathis' Wonderful! Wonderful! ‚ plays. A van with the word ‘Oak Park Retirement Living Shuttle Service pulls away and the “Oak Park Retirement Living’ building is revealed.]

♪ Sometimes we walk ♪

♪ hand in hand by the sea ♪

♪ and we breathe in the cool, salty air ♪

[The Impala drives is seen driving down the road and turns onto the road in front of the building.] ♪ ahh, ahh, ahh ♪

♪ you turn to me ♪

♪ with a kiss in your eyes ♪

♪ and my heart feels ♪

♪ a thrill beyond compare ♪

[Sam and Dean, wearing FBI suits, exit the car.]


SAM

Seriously? This place is an old folks' home?

DEAN

Looks awesome.

[They walk towards the entrance to the building. At the front door there is a sign the reads ‘Oak Park Retirement Living. Early Bird Specials! Reserve your tomorrow: TODAY!]

♪ Then your lips cling to mine ♪

♪ it's wonderful, wonderful ♪

[Dean points to the sign]

DEAN

Maybe we ought to make a reservation.

SAM [Chuckles]

Yeah, we should be so lucky to live long enough.

[Inside the building, Dean is walking across the lobby with a man]


MAN

As I told the police, I was walking by Harold's room, and I heard a loud banging noise. And then I heard Harold yell from inside of his suite, “Get it out of my head " so I knocked on the door and called to him.

And when he didn't reply, I used my pass key to get into his room.

[Sam opens the door to a room with yellow ‘Crime Scene’ tape across it. The man’s voice is heard off screen as Sam enters the room]]

MAN

That's when I saw him. He was on his back.

His skull was, um...

[The room is in disarray. The corner of the hearth in front of the fireplace is covered in blood. Sam’s EMF reader starts whining. The conversation continues off screen while Sam looks around the room]]

MAN

Well, there was a lot of blood.

DEAN

And nobody else was in the room.

MAN

No.

The windows and doors were locked.

[Sam pulls on the door and then walks away. The scene changes bac to Dean and the man]

MAN

I even checked the security logs. Nobody was in or out of Harold's room all night.

DEAN

Hmm.

MAN

I don't really understand what could have happened.

[A woman walks by]

MAN

Hey, Mildred.

MILDRED

Oh, good morning, Arthur.

ARTHUR

This is Mildred, one of our residents.

DEAN

Ah.

MILDRED [smiling brightly]

Good morning.

DEAN [looking a little uncomfortable]

Hi.

[Mildred walks away]

DEAN

Um, do you always work late at night?

[Dean and Arthur continue to walk across the lobby]

ARTHUR

I've been, uh, staying here, actually. My wife left me.

Via text, if you can believe it -- a whole series of emojis.

Hi. [To someone off screen]

DEAN

Wow. What did you do?

ARTHUR

Oh, I didn't stand for that. Unh-unh. Fought fire with fire.

Sent her the poop emoji.

DEAN

Well, that's one way to fly.

ARTHUR

I should have sent the heart. I can be so stupid.

Hi. [To someone off screen]

I just wish she'd call me back.

DEAN

Oh, no, no, I think you did the right thing.

Um, hey, listen -- since you've been staying here, uh, a lot, uh, have you noticed any strange... Sounds, smells, uh, cold spots?

ARTHUR

What? Uh, no. Why?

DEAN

Oh, just routine questions. Um, what about enemies? Harold have any enemies?

ARTHUR

Actually... He had quite a few.

[Sam is walking through another room that has been disheveled. The EMF is whining. He opens a dresser drawer and pill bottles rattle.]

SAM [looking confused]

What the hell?

[Scene changes to Sam dropping several prescription pill bottles onto a folder that Dean has open on a table in the dining hall]

SAM

Turns out Harold was stealing the other residents' Viagra.

DEAN

I know. A real dick move, huh?

[Chuckles]

SAM

So I got an EMF hit in his room, but I got an EMF hit on pretty much every floor in the building.

How many people died in this place?

DEAN

Arthur, the, uh... heartbroken manager, he gave me access to all the residents' files. This is everyone who has passed here.

Now, uh...

[Dean picks up a folder and hands it to Sam]

This guy, Jake Townsend, had beef with Harold, but it wasn't over blue pills.

[Sam opens the folder]

SAM

Whoa. Jake filed a formal complaint against Harold?

DEAN

Yeah, apparently Harold was stealing his pension checks and cashing them for himself.

Now, when Jake died, his family filed a civil suit against Harold, but it just got caught up in the courts and never went to trial.

SAM

So maybe Jake stuck around as a vengeful spirit, took matters into his own hands.

All right. So where's Jake Townsend buried?

[It’s nighttime and Sam and Dean are standing in a grave that they are digging up. Dean climbs out, sits at the edge and takes a sip of a beer]

SAM

Dude?

DEAN

Hmm?

Oh, you got this. You got it. You're doing great.

[Sam grunts as he continues to shovel]

DEAN

So no retirement, huh?

SAM

Hey, you're the one who's always wanted to go out blaze of glory style preferably while the Bon Jovi song is playing.

DEAN

I'm a candle in the wind.

Yeah, but the way you said it, it was like that blaze of glory was gonna happen sooner rather than later.

[Sam shovels, looking preoccupied]

DEAN

Are you okay?

SAM

No, I'm not, actually. Not at all.

Being so close to Lucifer again, that... Brought stuff up. Stuff I thought I forgot about.

DEAN

You want to talk about it?

SAM

No.

DEAN

Well, look.

Lucifer is never getting out of that cage, ever. And you are never going back, period. So... Case closed.

[Sam drives his shovel into the dirt, It clanks as it hit the top of the casket]

DEAN

And so is this one.

[Hinges creak as Sam and Dean open the casket and pour lighter fluid/gasoline and salt on the body]

DEAN

Kind of nice being back on a case, huh?

[Sam looks around the cemetery uneasily]

DEAN

Get your mind off of things.

SAM

Let's burn the bones so we can go home.

[Dean looks at Sam, hesitates, and then throws lit matches into the grave. The grave ignites in a wall of flames. Sam and Dean look into the grave pensively]


[Back at the Retirement home Arthur is on the phone at the front desk.]

ARTHUR [to person on the phone]

See you then. Okay.

[Mildred walks into the area]

ARTHUR

You up to some trouble, young lady?

MILDRED [Chuckles]

Always, Arthur.

[There is a high-pitched scream as Arthur winces and puts his fingers to his ear]

ARTHUR

Ohh! Do you hear that?

MILDRED

No. Are you all right?

[The lights start to flicker]

ARTHUR

It's okay. We've got backup generators.

[High-pitched scream again]

ARTHUR

Ohh! Really? You can't hear that?

MILDRED

No.

ARTHUR [wincing and putting his hands to his ears]

It's sounds like someone's screaming.

Ohh!

[Arthur looks up and sees the spirit from the opening scene at the end of the hallway. She starts to fly towards him and then vaporizes into black smoke]

ARTHUR

What is that?

MILDRED

I don't see anything.

[The screaming continues and Arthur grans his head in pain]

ARTHUR

Get it out of my head!

MILDRED [panicking]

Arthur, I-I don't hear anything!

Tell me what to do!

[Arthur is bleeding from his nose and eyes as the screaming continues]

ARTHUR

Oh!

[Arthur runs across the room and starts to bang his head against the window]

MILDRED

Oh, my God! Arthur!

[The window glass cracks from Arthurs head as the spirit appears behind Mildred]

Arthur!

[The glass breaks and Arthur falls out the window. Mildred is unaware of the spirit as it flies past her and out the window after Arthur]

Arthur!

[Mildred runs over to the window and looks out. The spirit is hovering over Arthurs body, it’s long tongue licking at his face. She turns her head quickly to look at Mildred and Mildred screams]

ACT TWO
[Sam, Dean (FBI Suits) and Mildred are standing in a balcony area over the lobby of the retirement home. There are indistinct conversations in the background]

[Camera shutter clicking]

MILDRED

Arthur said he heard something, like a scream.

SAM

And did you hear anything?

MILDRED

I didn't hear a thing...

Except the sound of Arthur bashing his head through that window.

He just wanted that noise to stop. He said, “Get it out of my head”

DEAN

Hmm. Did you notice anything else, a drop in temperature?

MILDRED

No. But the power went out.

And when I looked through the broken window, I saw something.

SAM

What did you see, exactly?

MILDRED [Sighs]

You're not gonna believe me. They certainly didn't.

But I know what I saw. This isn't my first brush with something like this.

I saw a ghost 10 years ago. Nobody believed me then, either.

DEAN [touching Mildred’s hand]

We believe you, Ms. Baker.

MILDRED

Oh, Agent Osbourne, thank you.

[Mildred grabs Dean’s hand in her own]

I feel so much safer knowing the FBI is looking into this.

[As Sam smirks at Dean being held captive by Mildred, something about a woman and a housekeeping cart catches his eye by]

DEAN

Well, that's...

I'm just gonna need my hand back.

MILDRED [chuckling]

Oh. Okay.

SAM

Ms. Baker, what did you see?

MILDRED [Sighs]

It was a woman. Long, flowing hair, blood-red robes, sunken eyes, and -- and she was...

[Voice breaking]

Feeding on Arthur's head.

SAM

I'm so sorry. Um, excuse me one second.

[Sam walks away and Dean looks as if he will follow. Mildred grabs his hands again]

MILDRED

Oh! Please don't leave me, Agent Osbourne.

DEAN

No, no. We're not going anywhere.

[Sam approaches the woman at the housekeeping cart. She has her back towards him]

SAM

Excuse me. Ma'am?

[the woman doesn’t turn around]

Ma'am?

[Sam reaches out and taps her shoulder. The woman turns towards him]

SAM

Sorry.

Uh...

[Sam reads her name tag]

SAM

Marlene, Special Agent Butler, FBI.

Do you know anything about what happened with Arthur last night?

MARLENE [speaking with a slight speech impediment]

Sorry. I wasn't working last night.

Oh. Um...

Were you working the night Harold Miller died?

[She shakes her head no]

All right. Um...

Thanks. [Sam tries to sign the word ‘thanks’]

MARLENE

It's, um...

[Marlene show Sam the correct way]

SAM

right, of course.

Uh, sorry. I-I only know a little.

I-I took some back in college, but that was a while ago.

MARLENE

Most people don't know any. I appreciate the trying.

I should probably, uh, get back.

SAM

Yes. Uh, thank you.

[Sam walks back to Dean]

DEAN [looking towards the woman]

Witness?

SAM

No. Okay.

So, apparently, not a ghost.

DEAN

No. No. Ghosts don't feed on busted-open heads.

SAM

Yeah.

[The woman is folding a towel at her cart in the hallway, looking at Sam and Dean as they talk]

SAM

All right, I'll check with the coroner, see if, uh, anything was missing from our first vic's brain.

DEAN

Fingers crossed it’s zombies, and we can get our” Walking Dead” on.


[The audio cuts out as Dean talks and captions appear on the screen]

DEAN

‘Well, whatever it is we’ve got to figure it out…

[the camera zooms in on Dean’s mouth as the captions continue]

…before the next feeding time’


[The woman continues to watch them, presumably reading their lips]

[Sam is talking on his cell phone as he walks into the dining hall]

SAM

Yeah, I got it Okay, thanks again.

[Cellphone beeps as Sam disconnects the call]

SAM

So, according to the coroner, part of Harold's frontal lobe was missing.

DEAN [nodding his head]

And that tracks with Banshees.

SAM

Banshees? I thought Banshees were good.

DEAN

The ones tied to fairy lore are.

They cry out as a warning to a victim's impending death.

[Dean hands an iPad to Sam with a page open to ‘Ancient Origins, Banshee’]

DEAN

But these guys... are malevolent Banshees -- total dick bags. They use their piercing scream to drive their prey crazy. Forces the vics to crack open their own eggs, and then the Banshees feed on the yolk.

Oh, and the only people who can hear the Banshee's scream are the vics.

SAM

Well, that would explain why Mildred didn't hear anything.

DEAN

Oh, and they, uh, travel through mist, which explains how they got into Harold's locked room.

And they only prey on the vulnerable.

SAM

Harold did just have hip replacement surgery.

DEAN

And Arthur's wife just left him. Broken heart.

SAM

That's a kind of vulnerable, I guess.

DEAN

They hunt the same place until it's picked clean. And they only hunt at night, so that just gives us a few hours to figure out who's next.

SAM

Then how do we kill it?

DEAN

Gold blade. I don't have any in the trunk, so I got to head back to the bunker and grab a couple. You stay here and figure out who in this place is vulnerable.

[Outside the retirement home, Dean walks to the Impala and gets in. As he pulls away the deaf woman from housekeeping is watching him from a second story window.


Dean arrives at the bunker and as he is walking down the stairs he hears a noise. He pauses and draws his gun. As he is walking down a long hallway he hears a clattering sound and runs towards it, gun raised. He approaches a room whose door is half open. He kicks the door fully open and aims his gun into the room]

DEAN [loudly]

Hey!

Cas? What the hell are you doing, man?

[Cas is standing in the room with his back towards Dean.

LUCIFER/CAS

Hello, Dean.

DEAN

Right, yeah.

[Dean lowers his gun]

We don't hear from you for days, you show up, you start wrecking the joint.

LUCIFER/CAS [Sighs]

I'm sorry.

DEAN

Okay. W-what are you doing?

[Lucifer/ turns around. He is holding papers in both hands and looks disheveled]

LUCIFER/CAS

Well, I'm... Looking for a spell, something to draw Amara out, but there's... There's nothing.

I had her in my sights. She was hurt. I should have ended it.

DEAN [walking towards Lucifer/Cas}

Wait. What?

How?

LUCIFER/CAS

Well, I don't know. But there has to be something. And how many more chances are we gonna get?

DEAN

Yeah, I know.

Saying you're gonna kill is one thing, but... Actually doing it's something totally different.

LUCIFER/CAS

What do you mean?

I've had two shots at Amara. I struck out both times.

LUCIFER/CAS

What are you talking about?

DEAN

I don't even know where to start.

LUCIFER/CAS

Dean...

Tell me everything.

[Scene changes to Mildred in her apartment making tea. There is a knock on door]

MILDRED

Come in.

[The door opens and Sam walks in. Mildred smiles brightly]

Oh, Agent Butler.

Well, please, do come in.

SAM

Sure.

MILDRED

Where's that partner of yours?

SAM

Oh, he, um -- he'll be back soon.

(Sam looks over to a picture on the wall. It looks like an advertisement for a show a woman holding a guitar and various lettering]

Is this you?

MILDRED [Chuckles]

Yes, that was a long time ago.

[The poster can be seen more clearly and it says ‘A Tribute to Patsy Cline]

Before I got so good-looking.

Please, have a seat.

SAM

Sure.

[Sam sits at the table with Mildred and clears throat]

MIKDRED

Like some tea?

SAM

Uh, no, thank you.

Ms. Baker?

MILDRED

Mm. Please, Mildred.

SAM

Mildred.

I need to be honest with you.

My partner and I, we're not really FBI. We're brothers, and we hunt monsters.

MILDRED [Chuckles]

I knew it. I knew it!

I -- you two are too cute to be FBI agents.

And I knew that damn ghost I saw years ago was real.

SAM

Does this, um... [Clears throat]

Does this look familiar?

[Sam opens a page on an iPad and hands it to Mildred.]

MILDRED

Oh, my God, yes.

[The page is the same on Dean was looking at earlier with the Banshee on it. Mildred taps on the picture and enlarges it]

It's a Banshee?

SAM

It is.

Banshees scream at their victims, getting them to harm themselves, and then they feed on their --

MILDRED

Brains.

SAM

Right.

Now, Banshees prey on the vulnerable, so I checked out all of the residents' medical records, and you have an atrial fibrillation, which can be treated with meds.

But it means that --

MILDRED

I'm vulnerable?

Am I next?

SAM

My brother and I aren't gonna let that happen.

[Mildred chuckles]

SAM

We're gonna protect you, okay?

MILDRED

Yeah.

Now, Banshees only hunt at night, so you're safe right now.

And we really need you to try and get some rest while you can.

We'll be back.

[Sam gets up from the table and goes to the door. Before he opens it he turns to face Mildred]

SAM

One more thing.

Do you know a housekeeper named Marlene? She's deaf.

MILDRED

I think maybe you got your names mixed up. There is one person on staff named Marlene, but she's on vacation.

Agent Butler, my granddaughter is deaf, and I could really use some practice signing.

So if there is a staff member that's deaf, I would love to talk to them.

SAM

So would I.

[Marlene is pushing the housekeeping cart down the hallway, stopping several times to look over her shoulder. At the same time Sam is walking through the hallways. He sees Marlene walking away from the cart that she has left at the the end of a hallway. Sam walks towards it and then we see him entering a dark laundry room. He closes the door behind him and turns on the light. He sees a triangular symbol painted in red on one of the machines.]

MARLENE

Hey!

[Sam turns towards Marlene as she slides a knife across her hand and places it in the middle of a similar symbol painted on a window directly behind her. Sam is thrown back against the machine with the symbol and struggles to break free as Marlene approaches him]

SAM

Ohh!

MARLENE

Dressing up as FBI to cover up your kills?

It's almost clever.

[Marlene walks towards Sam with a gold blade in her hand]

Never met a Banshee that could blend in.

SAM

Wait. What?

MARLENE

I read your friend's lips.

“It's feeding time”.

ACT THREE
[Marlene draws her hand back to slash Sam with the gold blade. Sam puts his hand out, defensively]

SAM

No, no, no, you're mixed up! You're mixed up.

W-we're not Banshees. We're hunters.

It's my brother. W-we're all hunting the same thing here, a-a Banshee.

In -- in blood red robes, right?

I swear.

Look, test me. Test me, please.

[Sam puts his hand put, palms up and Marlene slices his palm]

SAM

Ah. See?

[Marlene points the blade at Sam’s face]

SAM

Whoa. Hey.

Wait a minute. No.

[Marlene gets closer and the blade move alongside Sam’s neck…until it hits the symbol behind him. The symbol glows and Sam is released]

SAM [Breathing heavily]

Oh. Thanks.

My name is Sam Winchester.

MARLENE

Eileen Leahy.

The Banshee you're hunting...it killed my parents.

[Flashback to the baby (Marlene) crying in her crib as the banshee flies towards her. We here the Banshee screaming and her mother crying out and then all sound ceases]

EILEEN

A hunter found me in my crib, ears bleeding.

[Flashback to the baby in the crib, blood coming out of her ears]

EILEEN

Lillian O'Grady, this was hers.

[Sam and Marlene are looking at a hunter’s journal siting in a pile of clean sheets]

She'd been tracking the Banshee. Never found it, though.

SAM

So Lillian raised you.

EILEEN

More like trained me.

She died when I was 16.

SAM

On the job?

EILEEN

Cancer.

SAM

And you've been on your own ever since?

EILEEN

I prefer working alone.

Trust issues.

SAM

Yeah. I know.

[Sam raises his cut hand, holding a cloth to it. Eileen smiles]

SAM

So, was your mom a hunter, or a witch?

EILEEN

No. Her father was part of this secret organization.

It's defunct now.

SAM

The Men of Letters?

EILEEN

Yeah. How'd you know?

SAM

My brother and I...

We're like you. We're legacies.

[Scene changes back to Lucifer/Dean in the bunker. Dean places a wooden box on a table next to a gold blade]

DEAN

I tried to kill her.

LUCIFER/CAS

Well, the two of you are connected somehow by the Mark.

DEAN

Yeah, no, it's, uh... It's more than that.

LUCIFER/CAS

Attraction?

Oh, Dean.

DEAN

I know.

I know. Okay?

Whatever it is,

[Dean unwraps a gold blade from a cloth]

a... Attraction, connection... I got to tell you, man, it scares me.

I don't know that I can stop it. I don't know that I can resist it.

[Lucifer/Cas places a hand on Dean’s shoulder]

LUCIFER/CAS

Hey, it scares me, too. But we will find out what this is, I promise.

In the end, it may help draw her out. This could be a good thing.

[Dean’s cellphone ring. He walks away from Cas as he answers]

DEAN

Sam?

SAM

Dean, look up Edward Durbin II.

DEAN

Wait. What? In the Men of Letters' files.

[Dean is in another room in the bunker. He drops a large book onto a desk and begins to read from it as Lucifer/Cas walks up behind him]

DEAN

Oh, son of a bitch. She ain't lying.

[The page Dean is reading from is titled’ Record of Membership. It contains a picture of each ‘Men of Letters’ with their member #, name, date inducted, country of origin and duties]

DEAN

According to the Men of Letters' records, Edward Durbin II was inducted in 1939, part of a small delegation that was sent to Europe.

SAM [with Mildred and Eileen, sitting in Mildred’s apartment. Mildred is smiling appreciatively]

Wow.

DEAN

Right.

[Mildred signs to Eileen ‘I got dibs on the other guy. You can have the tall one’]

SAM

Yeah, her father had just lost his job.

He had a nervous breakdown.

DEAN

So, he was vulnerable.

SAM

Right. And her mom only knew some basic spells.

[Mildred giggles as she signs ‘I’m not much of a mountain climber anymore’ and laughs]

SAM

She used one to banish the Banshee, saved Eileen's life.

[Eileen signs [‘Are you sure you don’t want both?’]

Dean, the Banshee we're hunting is the same one that killed Eileen's parents.

[The scene switches between Sam and Dean as they have the following conversation]

DEAN

Awesome. All right. What's the plan?

SAM

Well, we're gonna use the same Celtic spell Eileen used to trap me.

When the Banshee comes for Mildred tonight, we trap it. And we hit it with gold.

DEAN

Right. I don't like using Mildred as bait.

SAM [smirking and turning away fro Mildred and Eileen, in a low voice]

Are you worried about her?

So does this mean she has a shot?

DEAN [smiling]

Well, I always did have a thing for Blanche on “Golden Girls”

SAM

Seriously?

DEAN

Hey, don't judge what you don't understand, Sammy.

SAM

No, I'm -- I'm not judging. I-I just always had a thing for Sophia.

DEAN

Yeah, I could see that.

SAM [whispering]

Look, I don't like using anyone as bait. But this is all we got.

DEAN

I'm on my way.

[Dean’s cellphone beeps as he disconnects the call]

DEAN

Cas, I got to get back to Sam.

Listen, about what we talked about, let's just keep that between you and me...

Till we know more, okay?

LUCIFER/CAS

Dean, that's not --

DEAN

Cas, just...trust me.

LUCIFER/SAM [Sighing]

All right.

But the next time you face Amara, you won't be alone.

DEAN

Thanks, Cas.

[Lucifer/Cas slowly smiles as Dean walks away]

[At the retirement home, Eileen leaves the housekeeping cart outside of an apartment. She enters the room and closes the door which has a sign that says ‘Closed for Cleaning’. Inside the room Sam is painting the Celtic symbol on opposite walls. Eileen looks at them critically]

EILEEN [Shrugging]

Not bad.

SAM

All right. I guess all we have to do now is, uh...

Wait.

EILEEN

Yeah.

[Eileen walks away, wringing her and nervously and sits down on a sofa. Sam walk over and waves a hand to get her attention]

SAM

Eileen?

[Sam sits on a chair next to her]

You okay?

EILEEN

I'm nervous.

If this really is the Banshee I've been looking for...

SAM

Eileen, in my experience... Revenge is not all it's cracked up to be.

Killing this Banshee is not gonna bring your parents back.

EILEEN

I never met them. They're just pictures to me.

[Eileen picks up her wallet, opens it to a picture of her as a baby with her parents and hands it to Sam]

SAM

But...

EILEEN

They're family.

My family.

SAM

I understand. Believe me.

[Sam hands the wallet back to Eileen]

But after you get your revenge, then what?

EILEEN [smiling]

I have no idea.

My mother was a lawyer. Be nice to follow in her footsteps.

SAM [Chuckles]

I was studying law at Stanford when my brother came and got me so we could get our revenge.

EILEEN

You've been hunting together ever since?

SAM

Yeah. I-I wouldn't do this without my brother. He's had my back every step of the way. Even when I let him down.

[The apartment door opens and Dean walks in.]

DEAN

Hey.

[Sam and Eileen stand up and turn towards the door]

SAM

Eileen, this is my brother, Dean Winchester.

Dean, this is Eileen Leahy.

DEAN [shaking hands with Eileen]

Eileen, it's good to meet you.

EILEEN

So you're a... a legacy, too.

DEAN

I guess so, yeah.

DEAN

Uh, right, well.

Uh...

[Dean rummages through a small duffel bag he has over his shoulder]

Let's see here.

[He pulls out a gold blade and hands it to Sam]

DEAN

There's one for you.

And I'm guessing you already have one.

Uh, guess we got an extra one for Mildred.

Where's Mildred?

[Door opens]

MILDRED

Agent!

Oh! I'm glad you're back.

[Mildred walks over to Dean and holds onto his arm]

DEAN

Yeah.

MILDRED

I feel safer already.

Um...Come here. I want to show you something.

[Mildred takes Dean by the hand and pulls him across the room. Dean looks nervously over to Sam. Mildred sits on the sofa as Dean stands next to her. Mildred chuckles and pats the empty space on the couch next to her]

MILDRED

Well, come on and sit down. I'm not gonna bite. Never really was my thing.

DEAN [slowly moves over to sit next to Mildred]

Okay.

[From behind Dean and Mildred we see a beautiful sunset out the window in front of the couch]

MILDRED

I have the same view from upstairs. West-facing rooms, they cost extra. You know, you got to pay for the view.

DEAN

It's not bad.

MILDRED

Not bad??

Honey, it's almost as gorgeous as you are.

DEAN

Ha!

MILDRED [Chuckles]

[Dean looks over as if looking for Sam to help him]

You know, tell me something. When's the last time you watched a sunset without waiting for something to go bump in the night?

[Dean shakes his head and smirks]

MILDRED

Hmm. You should try it sometime.

DEAN [rolling his eyes slightly]

Yeah.

MILDRED

I just hope this one isn't my last. I mean, does this stuff really work? A Banshee shows up and... you cut your hand and slap it on one of those things, and it gets trapped.

I mean, is this actually something that happens?

DEAN

Yep.

[Dean reaches into his bag and the floor and takes out two gold blades, placing the blade on the couch between him and Mildred]

And then it gets one of these.

Mildred... Everything's gonna be fine.

Okay?

DEAN

Tell me something.

What did you do before you retired?

MILDRED

[ Laughs]

I was in a Patsy Cline tribute band.

DEAN

No.

MILDRED

I'm deadly serious.

DEAN [Chuckles]

You ever miss life on the road?

MILDRED

Nah. Nah, I had my fun.

You want to know the secret to living a long and happy life?

DEAN

Actually, yes, I do.

MILDRED [Placing her hand on Dean’s chest and patting it]

Follow your heart. You do that, all the rest just figures itself out.

I did that. I followed my heart.

Traveled the world, made people smile, forget about their problems for a while. And then my heart said, “Well, you're done”. I had my fill and... And I retired.

And I love it. [Mildred pats Dean’s knee for emphasis]

DEAN

Hey, you know, this place isn't what I expected.

MILDRED

Oh, life here is great. I'd just like to enjoy it a little more.

DEAN

And you will. I promise.

[hesitantly] Your hand is still on my knee.

MILDRED [smiling as she looks down towards her hand and squeezes Dean’s knee]

I could move it up.

DEAN [getting up from the couch]

Okay.

[Mildred and Dean laugh as Dean walks away from the couch]

That's -- I'm gonna...

[High-pitched scream]

DEAN [stopping]

Do you hear that?

MILDRED

I don't hear anything. Do you?

DEAN

Sam?

[The screaming intensifies The lights flicker as Dean grabs his head, groans and drops to his knees. Sam runs towards Dean]

SAM

Dean?!

MILDRED

Oh, Sam, it's what happened to Arthur.

SAM

Hey, hey. Dean.

[Sam and Dean are kneeling on the floor. Dean looks over Sam’s shoulder and sees the Banshee screaming. Dean has blood dripping from his eyes]

SAM

Dean, look at me.

[Everyone turns to look where Dean is looking]

ACT FOUR
DEAN

Sam, it's here!

[The Banshees howls and then vaporizes into black smoke. Dean stands up, holding his head. Everyone looks around for the Banshee. The screaming starts again and the Banshee appears behind Eileen. She whirls around and swings the gold blade at the Banshee. The Banshee flings her across the room into a bookshelf.]

MILDRED

Eileen!

[Sam runs at the Banshee, swings his gold blade and slices her arm. The cut glows as the Banshee wave her arm and throws Sam across the room. He crashes through a door and lands on the floor in the adjacent room. In the main room Dean is grunting and banging his head against a door frame. Mildred grabs him from behind. The Banshee’s screams can be heard throughout the scene]

MILDRED

Dean, stop!

Stop!

EILEEN [from where she landed on the floor]

Mildred! [Eileen signs ‘The Symbol’ and points to her palm and then the symbol on the wall]


[Dean continues banging his head as the Banshee flies in behind him. Mildred slices her palm with the gold blade and slaps her palm in the middle of the symbol. The Banshee is flung across the room and is pinned onto the second symbol. Eileen grabs a gold blade from the floor, runs across the room and stabs the Banshee in the stomach. The wound glows and the Banshee once again vaporizes into black smoke. The screaming stops and the lights come back on]

[Dean sits up from where he was hunched over. He is bleeding from the head as Mildred runs over to him.

MILDRED

You okay?

[Dean roans]

SAM Hey.

[Sam looks over to Eileen, who is still be the wall where she stabbed the Banshee and signs and says ‘Thank you’. Eileen nods back]


[The next day Sam and Eileen are walking away from the retirement home]

SAM

So... How do you feel?

EILEEN

It felt like...

Just another kill. It didn't bring my parents back.

SAM

Nothing will.

What now? Law school?

EILEEN

No. This is my life.

SAM

Feel free to drop a line if you ever need anything...

Or even if you just want to hang out.

EILEEN [smiling]

You can't call me, though.

SAM [chuckling]

Okay.

EILEEN

I mean, you could call, but I won't answer.

[Mildred and Dean walk out of the retirement home]

MILDRED

So you boys hitting the road, huh?

DEAN

Yes, ma'am.

MILDRED

Well, it's for the best. It wouldn't have worked out between us anyway.

DEAN [smiling]

Why not?

MILDRED [chuckling and turning towards Dean]

Darlin'...

If there's one thing I've learned in all my years on the road, it's when somebody's pining for somebody else.

[Dean smirks]

Oh, don't try and hide it now. Follow your heart. Remember?

[They continue walking]

MILDRED

I don't know who the lucky lady is, but I am damn sure jealous.

DEAN

Well, I'm single, and I am ready to mingle, so...

MILDRED

Well, then you know where I live.

[Dean laughs]

DEAN

Yeah.

MILDRED

All right. You boys stay out of trouble.

DEAN

That's not gonna happen, Mildred.

[Mildred chuckles and sighs as she watches Sam and Dean walk away. She signs to Eileen ‘They look even cuter…walking away’ Then she makes a gesture as if grabbing a behind, circles her face and says ‘WOW!’]

[Sam and Dean get into Impala and drive away]


ACT FIVE
[Sam is sitting at the kitchen table in the bunker looking at his iPad. Dean walks in behind him. Sam grabs a can of beer and tosses it over his shoulder to Dean. Dean catches it and sits down across from Sam]

SAM

Is Cas gone?

DEAN

Yeah, I guess so.

SAM

What was he doing here anyway?

DEAN

He was looking for lore on the Darkness.

Something a little off about him, too.

SAM

Something always seems a little bit off about Cas. [Scoffs]

Yeah, you know, being so close to Lucifer probably wasn't easy for him, either.

DEAN

We'll just keep an eye on him.

SAM

You were right, by the way.

Getting back on the job, it... It helped.

DEAN

Wait. Say that again. The -- that part about me being right.

SAM [Chuckles]

You're an idiot.

Dean...

When I was with Lucifer, he, um... He showed me things. It was like a highlight reel of my biggest failures.

DEAN

Yeah, he was messing with you. That's what he does.

SAM

Give me a sec.

[Sighs]

I should've looked for you. When you were in Purgatory, I... I should've turned over every stone.

[Dean hangs his head as he listens]

But I didn't. I stopped. And I've never forgiven myself for it.

DEAN

Well... I have.

Hey. That's in the past, man. What's done is done.

All that matters now, all that's ever mattered, is that we're together.

So... Shut up and drink your beer.

[They each take a drink from their beer]

DEAN

Yeah. You gonna be able to sleep tonight?

SAM

Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

What about you?

DEAN

Well, I still got some ringing going in my head, but nothing some good music can't wash out.

[Sam picks up his beer and iPad and walks away from the table towards the entrance to the kitchen]

SAM

You know...

[Sam turns towards Dean]

I still can't figure that out. I mean, Banshees go after the vulnerable, right?

So why did it go after you?

DEAN

You're overthinking it.

It was going after Mildred, it saw my gold blade, acted out of self-defense.

Simple.

SAM

Yeah You're probably right.

DEAN

I'm always right.

SAM

Yeah, yeah.

DEAN

Night.

[Sam leaves the kitchen]

SAM

Night.

[Dean remains at the table, looking troubled.

Warren Zevon's “Prison Grove” starts to play]


[Sam is in his room looking into an open wooden box. There are various objects including a picture of Mary, Dean and Sam when Sam was a baby and one of Sam and Dean as kids. He adds a brochure from Oak Park Retirement Living to the box and closes it]

♪ rushes in like a fallen star ♪
