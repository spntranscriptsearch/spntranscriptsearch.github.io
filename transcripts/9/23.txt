TEASER


[Scene picks up seconds after the last episode. SAM and CASTIEL are holding a feral Dean back from GADREEL who is slumped to the floor bleeding angel grace everywhere. DEAN wrangles out of their grasp and stands to face SAM who is blocking his was to GADREEL.]


SAM

Drop the blade, Dean.


DEAN

Move.


SAM

Dean. Look at me.


DEAN

Sam! Move! Aah!


[CASTIEL jumps DEAN from the side and SAM leaps in to grab DEAN's right arm and the blade.]


SAM [trying to wrestle the blade out of his brother's grasp]

Let it go! Let it go! Let it go.


[A few second later in the Bunker's dungeon, SAM and CASTIEL shove DEAN inside and stand between him and the door]


DEAN

The hell if you think I'm riding the pine on this one, guys.


SAM

Something is wrong with you, Dean. And until we figure out what, this is where you have to stay.


DEAN

And you two are gonna do what? Take on Metatron yourselves? That's smart. Oh, no, wait. No, you -- [motions to CASTIEL] you lost your Angel army. And you -- [motions to SAM] now you're trying to lock up the one guy who has a shot at killing the son of a bitch!

Hell of a plan, fellas!


[In silence, SAM and CASTIEL turn and push the doors shut locking DEAN in the dungeon. DEAN calls after them.]


DEAN

Look, hey, guys. Sam. Sammy!


[Back in the main room of the bunker, SAM and CASTIEL put the first blade into a box on the table]


CASTIEL

Sam.


SAM

Yeah?


CASTIEL

Dean...wasn't wrong. My followers have abandoned us.


SAM

Yeah, and Gadreel says he can help us. From where I sit, that's more than an even trade.


[They look over to where GADREEL should be on the floor but there is a lot of blood and no GADREEL. Scene switches back to DEAN in the dungeon. He is throwing up on the floor and coughing horribly. He finally recovers just a little and walks over to a small mirror in the cabinet. We can all see his mouth covered in the blood he has been coughing up.]


SEASON 9 TITLE CARD


ACT ONE


[METATRON and his assistant NEIL are in METATRON's office in heaven. METATRON is concentrating on whatever he is writing in a fury on his typewriter.]


NEIL

So, uh, Metatron. Metatron.

God?


METATRON

Just a second.


NEIL

Is that the new Angel handbook you're working on, or, uh...?


METATRON

No, no, this is a story, Neil, a marvelous story, full of love and heartbreak and...love.


NEIL

Sort of like "The Notebook."


METATRON

Uh...


NEIL

I love "The Notebook".


METATRON

No.

[he grabs two outfits from the chair and holds them up for NEIL to look at]

Quick. Which makes me look more pathetic?


NEIL

Why do you want to look pathetic? You've just reunited all the angels under the banner of heaven. I mean, that's like...


METATRON

Winning a People's Choice Award? Not quite the real deal, now, is it?

All set?


[NEIL leans over to a box and adjusts some knobs. He then hands METATRON a microphone.]


NEIL

Uh, yes, sir. Uh, flip the switch...Uh-huh....wait for the light, and bingo.


METATRON

And every angel in heaven and on earth will hear me?


NEIL

You and only you. The signal blocks out all other voices on angel radio. Come on.


METATRON [testing the microphone]

Hello? This is Metatron. [there is terrible reverb from the mic]


NEIL

More reverb.


METATRON [annoyed]

Because I'm Lou Gehrig?


NEIL

Sorry. Sorry.

[He adjusts some knobs and then gives METATRON the silent "You're On" finger.]


METATRON

Don't do that.

[Then into the mic]

I'd like to take a moment to welcome you all back. I want you to know how moved I am that you've accepted me as your new God. My heart, as they say, is full, which is why I want to share some wonderful news with you. I'm going on a short trip. Heaven's door will be temporarily closed pending my return, but rest assured all will be explained. And it will be...Glorious.


[METATRON sets down the mic and gathers up his 'pathetic' outfit.]


NEIL

Where are you going?


METATRON

To tell the rest of the story.


[SAM and CASTIEL have tracked GADREEL to a field outside the bunker. GADREEL is laying in the grass with his slashed chest bleed profusely. SAM and CASTIEL rush to him. GADREEL snaps out of his near unconscious state when he sees who it is.]


GADREEL

Please. I'll leave you alone, I swear.


CASTIEL [reaching out to heal him]

We're not here to hurt you.


GADREEL

No. Your Grace. Healing me will only weaken you.


[CASTIEL doesn't even hesitant and instantly heals GADREEL]


GADREEL

Did you hear him?


CASTIEL

Metatron. Yes. Where is he going? What does he want?


GADREEL

I'm afraid...humanity.


[Scene changes to Crowley getting a back massage from a pretty girl in a massage parlor.]


CROWLEY

Ohh...God!


GIRL

I would have thought you'd be more relaxed...Having defeated Abaddon.


CROWLEY

What can I say? I wear my stress.


GIRL

You know...With so many demons having rallied back to your side, well, it's only natural that they would look to their...King for some...direction.


CROWLEY

Love, if I wanted a soapy massage from Dr. Phil, I would have hit 3 on the speed dial, all right?


GIRL

I'm sorry, sir.

[the room starts to shake]

Sir, I believe you're being summoned. It's a Winchester.


[DEAN is kneeling in the bunker dungeon with a summoning spell in front of him. He lights the ingredients and instantly CROWLEY appears inside the Devil's Trap.]


CROWLEY

What's that smell?


DEAN [looking rather scared and lonely]

What the hell's happening to me, you son of a bitch?


CROWLEY

Liquor before beer, bad taco? How should I know?


DEAN

I can't turn it off! Ever since I killed Abaddon, it's -- it's like this whole...other thing. I get this high and I-I-I need to kill. I mean, I really, really need to kill. And if I don't --


CROWLEY

You yak your guts out. It's the mark.


DEAN

Meaning?


CROWLEY

It wants you to kill. The more you kill, the better you feel. The less you kill, the less better you feel.


DEAN

How much less better?


CROWLEY

One would imagine

the least-best better.


DEAN

So dead? Well, Cain had the mark. He didn't die.


CROWLEY

Cain was a demon. Your body's not strong enough to contain the blade's power.


DEAN [his eye betraying his fear]

What if I got rid of it?


CROWLEY

You want to get rid of it?


DEAN [getting himself in back in control]

What I want is Metatron.


CROWLEY

Go on.


DEAN

But I have to get through that door, and I have to get to the blade. And you're gonna help me.


[Camera switches to SAM, CASTIEL and GADREEL entering the bunker. The box that the Blade was in lays open on the table.]


SAM [rushing to it and finding it empty]

Oh, no.


GADREEL

What's that smell?


SAM

Sulfur.


ACT TWO


[SAM is on the phone talking to his brother's voicemail]


SAM

Dean, pick up the phone. Call me back. I'm not kidding, all right? Don't do this. Not like this.


CASTIEL

Are you sure it was Crowley?


SAM

Who else would he summon? I mean, he and Crowley have been bromancing over the Blade ever since Dean got the mark.


GADREEL

The mark?


CASTIEL

The mark of Cain.


GADREEL

So that's what Dean cut me with -- the First Blade. In a way, that could be useful.


SAM

What?


GADREEL

Well, Metatron is more powerful than ever, but if Dean has the First Blade and the mark, that might give us our best chance.


SAM

You're joking, right? An hour ago, we were ready to throw Dean into a padded cell, and now you say

he's our best chance?


CASTIEL

Hear him out, Sam.


SAM

Oh, right. Excuse me. Sorry, guys. Uh, sorry I'm a little less than eager to hear that our best chance is -- is arming the warhead and hoping it hits the mark. This is not a bomb we're talking about. This is my brother.


GADREEL

And your brother would not be in this alone. We can help.


SAM

How?


GADREEL

I believe Metatron has found a way to tap into the Angel tablet, harnessing its power to give him powers equivalent to --


SAM

God, right? I mean, that's what this is all about, isn't it? Metatron wants to be God.


[GADREEL nods


SAM

Great, well, that basically makes him unstoppable.


CASTIEL

Not if we can break the connection between Metatron and the tablet. That would make him just an ordinary Angel. Where's the tablet?


GADREEL

Metatron's office.


SAM

In heaven?


GADREEL

I can get us to the door.


SAM

And then what? I mean, why would they let you in? If Metatron's number two shows up with heaven's most wanted, [motioning at CASTIEL] the gig is up.


CASTIEL

Sam, we have to try.


[Scene switches to a lady walking down the street on her phone]


LADY

Damn it, Al, I don't care what you've got going on tonight. He's your kid, too, and I'm telling you he's on drugs.


[The lady goes to cross the street and walks right into a oncoming car. She is thrown over the vehicle and then lays still on the road bleeding out of her nose and mouth.]


CROWD [rushing to help her]

Oh, my God! Oh, my God. She's dead, man! She's dead.


METATRON [dressed in his pathetic outfit steps out of the crowd]

I'm not so sure about that.


[DEAN and CROWLEY pull up to a cafe in the IMPALA. He enter and Dean spread out on a table with the First Blabe wrapped in its cloth and he computer. He is all on mission. CROWLEY sits down as well. The waitress approaches.]


WAITRESS

What can I get you fellas?


DEAN

Coffee. Black.


CROWLEY

Are you serious? You take this girl's table, her time, you spread out like an overgrown teenager, and for what? What's the tip on a single cup of Joe? A nickel?


DEAN [ with a withering glare at CROWLEY]

Double cheeseburger --everything, heavy on the onions.


WAITRESS

You got it.


CROWLEY

So this is what you and moose do, eh? Crisscross the country, searching for evil, order your nitrates, partake of the local attraction.


DEAN

Yep.


CROWLEY

You never get tired of the rat race? Never get the urge to just...bugger off and howl at the moon? Never ask yourself, "is this it? Is this all there is?" I kicked human blood, you know.


DEAN

Oh, so you're full-metal douche again. Well, that's fantastic. Would you like a stuffed bear?


CROWLEY

Just trying to make conversation.


DEAN

How's hell, Crowley?


CROWLEY

Hell's fine. Hell's like a Swiss watch. Don't worry about hell. Hell's complicated.


DEAN

"Game of Thrones" is complicated. Shower sex -- that's complicated. Hell ain't complicated. Your problem ain't hell. It's you.


CROWLEY

Fair enough.

What's your problem, then?


DEAN

My problem is Metatron. Right now there's nothing. There's no angel smitings, no crazy acts of God, no vermin, hail. If Metatron's making his move on earth, he is taking his sweet-ass time.


CROWLEY [noticing a couple of his demons walk through the door.]

Never fear. Cavalry's here.


[The two demons walk up to CROWLEY and one hands him a smart phone with a video on it. CROWLEY nods and motions for them to leave]


DEAN

And?


CROWLEY

Apparently... Your angel has gone viral.


[CROWLEY hands the recording to DEAN and it plays the scene from the street with METATRON as captured by two teenage boys on their camera phone.]


BOY #1 [following a girls ass down the sidewalk]

And that, America, is perfection.


BOY #2

Yo, dude, that's your sister.


[The car crashes into the lady walking and the boys quickly run to the scene with their camera still recording.]

Oh, my God! She's dead, man! She's dead.


METATRON

I'm not so sure about that.


[He bends down and heals the lady. As he helps her sit up he whispers something in her ear.]


BOY #1

Is he ser--is he freaking serious?!


BOY #2

Did you see that?! Holy...Tell me you just got that. Dude, what's your name?


METATRON [looking straight into the camera]

Marv.


DEAN

When was this taken?


CROWLEY

A couple of hours ago. Muncie, Indiana.


DEAN

What did he whisper in her ear?


CROWLEY

Exactly.

[DEAN gathers his stuff and gets up]

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not gonna eat your food?


DEAN

Not hungry.


[Scene changes to CASTIEL and GADREEL pulling up outside a kids playground. There is a young girl and her mother playing there.]


CASTIEL

The door to heaven is in a playground?


GADREEL

Guarded by two of Metatron's most loyal. I recruited them myself. So, you said you had a plan... How we might convince them to let us pass.


CASTIEL [pulling out handcuffs]

Wookiee.


GADREEL [looking very confused]

Brother, I have no idea what that means.


CASTIEL

It's a reference to a very popular film that -- never mind.


[As they approach the playground with CASTIEL in handcuffs, the young girl gets off the swing]


PURAH [getting the other angel's attention

Asariel.


GADREEL

Asariel, Purah, make way.


PURAH

The door's closed, Gadreel, by orders of Metatron.


GADREEL

And who do you think gave the order to capture Castiel? Unless you think Metatron isn't interested in questioning the leader of the rebellion?


ASARIEL

The spell must be redrawn.


GADREEL

As quickly as possible, then.


[Scene change to DEAN and CROWLEY pulling up to a RV Park. SAM is standing next to the RV they stop by.]


DEAN [to CROWLEY]

I got this.


[DEAN gets out of the IMPALA and walks up to his brother]


SAM [more than slightly annoyed]

I guess one of us doesn't need a demon to help follow a clue trail. You're looking for miracle lady, right? Yeah, she's gone. I had a nice chat with her, though.


DEAN

Sam, whatever kind of intervention you think this is, trust me, it ain't. I'm not gonna explain myself to you.


SAM

Yeah, I sort of got that. I just thought you might like to know that while you two have been playing, uh, odd couple, your real friends, like Cas, like the angel you stabbed, Gadreel --they're out there right now

risking their asses to help you win this fight.


DEAN

What the hell are you talking about?


SAM

A fight, I might add, you made that much more complicated when you decided to stab the one angel who could actually get us to Metatron.


DEAN [angry flaring]

You mean the angel that took you for a joy ride? The angel that slaughtered Kevin? That angel?


SAM

Who you let in the front door in the first place. You tricked me, Dean. And now I'm the one who wakes up in the middle of the night seeing my hands killing Kevin, not you. So, please, when you say you don't want to explain anything to me, don't. I get it. And I also get that Metatron has to go. And I know you're our best shot to do that.


DEAN

I'm gonna take my shot, for better or worse.


SAM

I know.


DEAN

No matter the consequences.


SAM

I know. But if this is it, we're gonna do it together.

You want to know what he whispered to her, right, in the video? His next stop.


CROWLEY [overhearing from the car]

So what are we all gollywagging on about? Chop-chop.

[DEAN and SAM both turn to face him with faces that tell him to get lost.]

Excuse me. I'm not exactly demon Minion number three here. As the kids say, I've got mad skills.


DEAN

Look, I don't know what you expected here, okay. I don't really care, but you wanted off the hamster wheel. Get off.


CROWLEY

Well, I guess I've been Winchestered. I'd wish you boys good luck... If I thought it would help.


[CROWLEY disappears]


[Back at the playground, PURAH finishes drawing the angel spell portal in the sand. It lights up and GADREEL and CASTIEL step into it. They are transported to an elevator in heaven. INGRID and HANNAH met them as they exit.]


INGRID

Well done. We've sent word to Metatron. He'll be back shortly. You can wait inside.


GADREEL

Thank you, Ingrid.


[CASTIEL, GADREEL, INGRID and HANNAH all step into METATRON's office but it is immediately transformed from the office to jail cells that lock both GADREEL and CASTIEL in separate cells.]


CASTIEL

What's going on?


GADREEL

No, no, no, no! Not here!


INGRID

Did you really think your little ruse would work?


GADREEL

Please. Please!


INGRID

Welcome to heaven's jail, Castiel. I believe Gadreel can give you the tour.


[In a homeless encampment under trestles, METATRON is pushing a grocery cart into the community. A woman stops him.]


WOMAN

Excuse me? I'm sorry, but are you...Marv?


[METATRON lifts his hood to reveal that he is Marv and the woman breaks into a relieved grin. She walks him over to another man.]


WOMAN

This is my friend George.


GEORGE

I hear you perform miracles.


METATRON

It is a burden I accept.


GEORGE

A little single malt?


WOMAN

George.


GEORGE

What?


METATRON

How about we take care of that diabetes? [METATRON heals him and then motions to his flask] Left you a little something to celebrate with.


WOMAN

Thank you.


[Suddenly a man with a scarf shouts out]


He's a fraud!


METATRON

I'm afraid I don't know what you mean, good sir. How can one be a fraud when one offers nothing? A little love, a little hope, the occasional miracle -- nothing more.


SCARF ANGEL

You know exactly what I mean...Metatron.


METATRON

Excuse me?


SCARF ANGEL

His name is Metatron. And much as he'd like you to think... He's not one of you. He's an angel. We both are.


METATRON

An angel? Okay. Somebody's been drinking out of George's canteen.


SCARF ANGEL

So you deny you're the former scribe of God...


METATRON

Sir.


SCARF ANGEL

...a petty, unliked, unloved angel...


METATRON

These people don't want to hear --


SCARF ANGEL

...driven by the relentless pursuit of power and nothing more...


METATRON

This has really gone too far.


SCARF ANGEL

...who's already brought the rest of the angels under his iron thumb.


METATRON

As I will you, brother, if you don't --


HOMELESS WOMAN

Shut your mouth! Angel? Scribe of God? Please.


SCARF ANGEL

It's true.


HOMELESS WOMAN

What is true is what I can see with my own two eyes. You want to call him pathetic, common? Be my guest. Who here isn't? But who here has the gift that this man has? Do you know what he did?


SCARF ANGEL

And I'm afraid if you'd seen what I've seen, you'd think of him as nothing more than an abomination.


GEORGE

Abomination?! Try "Miracle Worker"!


HOMELESS WOMAN

Try "Messiah."


METATRON

Better.


SCARF ANGEL

I am sorry you don't believe me. But I must do what my mission demands. I must protect you.


[SCARF ANGEL goes at METATRON but doesn't get two steps before his is attacked by the crowd. They beat him down and throw him to the ground.]


METATRON

Yeah, that's not gonna, uh...They love me. They really, really love me.


[METATRON drops his angle blade to the ground and kicks it into the riot of people beating SCARF ANGEL. GEORGE picks it up and stabs it into him. He dies in a flash of light.]


ACT THREE


[Scene opens with DEAN digging around in the IMPALA's trunk which is parked outside the homeless community at night. His right hand shakes uncontrollably until he lays it on the covered blade. DEAN reacts to the power radiating off the blade. SAM walks up unnoticed but see his brother getting high from the blade's power. He clears his throat and DEAN whips his hand off the blade.]


DEAN

Anything?


SAM

Uh, yeah. He's up there. About a mile up the road. There's a homeless encampment. The way the folks are talking, he's got them convinced he's some kind of new Jesus or something.


[DEAN nods]


SAM

You good?


DEAN

Yeah, I'm good.


[SAM reaches over and picks up the First Blade. He hands it to his brother in silence.]


DEAN

Listen, Sammy, about, um, you know, the last couple of months...


SAM

I know.

So, before we find something else to fight about...tell me...Are you ready to gut this bitch?


[SAM turns to pick up his bag but as he turns back around to face his brother, DEAN throws a punch and knocks him out cold.]


DEAN [kneels next to his unconscious brother and gently lays his sprawled hand on his chest to get it off the ground]

Sorry, little brother. It's not your fight.


[Scene changes to HANNAH talking to GADREEL and CASTIEL who are still locked up in Heaven's prison.]


HANNAH

Okay, so you're telling me that Metatron set you up, arranged those suicide bombers to make himself look like the victim.


CASTIEL

Gadreel was his second in command. For what other reason than the truth would he turn against Metatron?


HANNAH

So now I'm expected to trust the word of an angel who's only ever thought of himself since the Garden, and you? You told us not a single angel more would die in this fight.


CASTIEL

What do you think I have been trying to do?


HANNAH

Trying? By killing Metatron?


CASTIEL

He is the reason for all of our suffering.


HANNAH

Nothing you say matters.


CASTIEL

Would you rather I not try at all?


HANNAH

Not if you can't prove it.


CASTIEL

So give us a chance. Let us out, Hannah. Please.


[DEAN walks up to the homeless encampment]


GEORGE

Can I help you?


DEAN

Take it easy, Chief.


WOMAN

You're Dean Winchester.


DEAN

Now, how did you know that?


WOMAN

He said you were coming.


DEAN

Well, here I am. Where's Metatron?


GEORGE

Marv.


DEAN

Sure.


WOMAN

In there... praying for our forgiveness.


DEAN

Forgiveness for what?

[The WOMAN's eyes go to a blood pool on the ground]

Is he, now?


[Back in Heaven's Prison]


GADREEL

I sat in this hole for thousands of years, thinking of nothing but redemption, of reclaiming my good name. I thought of nobody, no cause, other than my own.


CASTIEL

You've been redeemed, my friend.


GADREEL

The only thing that matters in the end is the mission -- protecting those who would not and cannot protect themselves --the humans. None of us is bigger than that. And we will not let our fears, our self-absorption prevent us from seeing it through. Not anymore.


CASTIEL

No. Of course not.


GADREEL

Move to the other side of your cell, Castiel, and keep your head down.


CASTIEL

What are you doing?


[HANNAH rushes to his cell and see that GADREEL has carved the suicide sigil on his chest. She fumbles with the key to unlock the door]


GADREEL

When they say my name, perhaps I won't just be the one who let the serpent in. Perhaps I will be known as one of the many...


CASTIEL

Gadreel.


GADREEL

...who gave heaven a second chance. Run, sister.


[GADREEL jams a sharp piece of rock into his chest and blows apart with power breaking down the prison walls. HANNAH rushes in to see him and CASTIEL slowly climbs out of his own cell]


CASTIEL

Do you believe him now?


[Back at the homeless encampment, DEAN has found METATRON. He is stilling in a meditation pose on the floor at the back of the warehouse.]


DEAN

You can save the humble-pie Jesus routine for somebody who gives a damn.


METATRON

The problem with you, Dean, is the cynicism. Always with the cynicism. But most people -- even the real belly crawlers living in filth...Or Brentwood...They don't want to be cynical. They just want something

to believe in.


DEAN

And that'd be you.


METATRON

Why not me?


DEAN

You've been working those people outside for, what, a day? They've already spilled blood in your name. You are nothing but Bernie Madoff with wings.


METATRON [rising to his feet from the floor]

So I'm a fake. Do you have any idea how much pan-cake makeup and soft lighting it took to get God to work a rope line? He hated it. And, you know, humans sense that. So they prayed harder and longer and fought more wars in his name. And for what?! So they could die of malaria? Leukemia? And all the while, blaming themselves! "Oh, if only I'd been more prayerful, "God would have loved me! God would have saved me!" You know what?! God didn't even know their name! But I do. Because I've walked among them. And I can save them.


DEAN

Sure, you can. So long as your mug is in every Bible and "What would Metatron do?" is on every bumper.


METATRON

And? What, are you blaming me for giving them what they want, giving them a brand they can believe in?


DEAN [starting to unwrap the First Blade in his hand]

I'm blaming you for Kevin! I'm blaming you for taking Cas' Grace. Hell, I'm blaming you for the Cubs not winning The World Series in the last 100 freaking years. Whatever it is... I'm blaming you.


METATRON

The First Blade. Nasty piece of work, isn't she? Okay, let's say you win, Dean, and I die. What's the world

left with then, hmm? A herd of panty-waisted angels and you? Half out of your mind with lord knows what pumping through those veins?


DEAN [stepping up close to METATRON]

Yeah, you see, the only thing you've said that went into my ear was that you die.


METATRON

Ohh. Fine. We'll fight. I don't know what you expect is gonna come of all this. Unless... That's why you're stalling. Because you know nothing's gonna come of this unless your pals succeed upstairs. Well, here's a news flash -- humpty and dumpty are starring in their very own version of "Locked Up Abroad: Heaven"

right now.


[DEAN turns to the side to hide his anger and then throws out his hand to stab METATRON with theh Blade. But METATRON blocks the blow and DEAN pushes him in the face with his left hand. METATRON stumbles back]


METATRON

Wow, that big blade and that... douchy tribal tat sure gave you some super juice. Whoo! Okay.


[METATRON motions with his hand to bring it on. DEAN rushes him but gets thrown in the air and hit the wall about 10 feet up and falls to the ground with a crash.]


[In METATRON's office in Heaven, HANNAH has INGRID at bladepoint.]


CASTIEL

Where is it?

[INGRID refuses to talk]

Remove her.


[METATRON flings DEAN back against the wall and he falls to the floor again. METATRON viciously kicks DEAN's right arm and the First Blade flies out of his hand. Then METATRON steps on his wrist with all his weight.]


METATRON

So, you took Abaddon's scalp, then you figured you'd take on little old nebbishy me. What could go wrong?

[DEAN groans in pain as METATRON's foot crushes down on his wrist]

And you're powered by the bone of a jackass, and it is just awesome, right? Here's a tip -- next time, try to be powered by the word of God.


[METATRON kicks DEAN in the chest.]


[SAM comes flying down the stairs into the homeless encampment. He looks around wildly for his brother. When he doesn't see him and the homeless guardians surround him he draws his gun.]


SAM

Stay back. Stay back! Where's Metatron?!


[Back in the warehouse behind the encampment, METATRON is beating the living daylights out of DEAN. He punches him almost unconscious and DEAN slumps to the ground. There is blood pouring from his nose and mouth and ears...METATRON bends down and delivers one more brutal punch to DEAN's face.]


[CASTIEL is still searching in METATRON's office for the Angel Tablet. He finally sees METATRON's typewriter sitting on the desk and rushes to it. He lifts the cover and there is the Angel Tablet glowing brightly.]


[DEAN is barely conscious but he can open his eyes just enough to see the First Blade sitting on a grate a few yards away. SAM rushes in from the opposite side of the warehouse at a breakneck run. DEAN, using the little strength he has, wills the Blade into his hand. Just as he goes to swing up and stab the Blade into METATRON, METATRON buries an angel blade deep into DEAN's chest with both hands. DEAN gasps horribly as the sound of his blood pouring out of his body reverberate in the open warehouse...


SAM

No-o-o!


Everything goes slow motion as DEAN gasps for air. METATRON pulls the blade out of his chest. DEAN's eyes slowly move to meet SAM's across the warehouse. Big brother and little brother share a gaze as DEAN's life starts to ebb away.]


ACT FOUR


[The Angel Tablet falls to the floor and shatters into a thousand pieces as DEAN's near lifeless body falls over. SAM races to his big brother completely ignoring METATRON standing right there, angel blade dripping with DEAN's blood. SAM grabs his brother's upper arm and pulls him back into a sitting position against the wall...


SAM

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.


DEAN's eyes shoot open as the warehouse starts to shake. SAM then remembers METATRON and goes to stab him with an angel blade. METATRON disappears and appears in his heavenly office in front of CASTIEL who is sitting in his chair.]


METATRON

Well played, Castiel. Obviously, you and Gadreel managed to turn a few dead enders against me.


CASTIEL

Gadreel is dead.


METATRON

Ah. So Gadreel bites the dust. And the Angel tablet -- arguably the most powerful instrument in the history of the universe -- is in pieces, and for what again? Oh, that's right -- to save Dean Winchester. That was your goal, right? I mean, you draped yourself in the flag of heaven, but ultimately, it was all about saving one human, right? Well, guess what. He's dead, too.

[CASTIEL's horrified eyes shoot to METATRON's face]

And you're sitting in my chair.

[METATRON uses his mind to handcuff CASTIEL to the chair]


[Back in the warehouse, SAM is trying desperately to press a cloth to his brother's gaping chest wound. DEAN struggles to talk...


DEAN [weakly]

Sammy, you got to get out of here before he comes back.


SAM

Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shut up. Shut up. Just save your energy, all right? Oh, man. We'll stop the bleeding. We'll -- we'll get you a doctor or -- or I'll find a spell. You're gonna be okay.


[SAM takes his brother's hand and presses it to his chest to keep the cloth in place.]


DEAN

Listen to me. It's better this way.


SAM

What?!


DEAN [gasping]

The Mark. It's making me into something I don't want to be.


SAM

Don't worry about the Mark. We'll figure out the Mark later. Just hold on, okay? Get you some help.


[SAM pulls his brothers arm over his shoulder and grabs him around the waist and hauls him up. DEAN moans in agony.]


[In Heaven]


CASTIEL

You will never get away with this.


METATRON

Get away with what? You told a silly story to a group of less-than-believers. I'll clean up your mess in an hour.


CASTIEL

You give our brothers and sisters far too little credit. They will soon learn that you have been playing them.


METATRON

And then? They will do nothing because they are frightened little sheep following my crook wherever it leads. And where I'm taking them, back to our rightful place atop this mountain of human shame and excrement -- when that happens, trust me, they're not gonna care how they got there.


[SAM is struggle to keep his brother upright as he practically carries him toward the exit. DEAN is gasping for air and trying to hold the cloth to his chest. SAM's hand covers his over the cloth and the wound]


DEAN

What happened with you being okay with this?


SAM

I lied.


DEAN

Ain't that a bitch?


[In Heaven]


METATRON

You know, why you could never quite pull it together, Castiel? While you're sitting here with Your Grace slowly burning away and your reputation long extinguished? No curiosity. You didn't read enough. You never learned how to tell a good story.


CASTIEL [looking straight at METATRON]

But you did.


[CASTIEL swings his eyes over to the desk where METATRON's all-angel microphone sits with the switch on, broadcasting his entire speech to every angel in Heaven and Earth. The doors fly open and many angels walk in and take METATRON captive. CASTIEL raises an angle blade but then doesn't use it.]


[The Winchesters are still struggling for the exit.]


DEAN

Sam. Hold up. Hold up.

[SAM sits him down on a piece of equipment. DEAN has fresh blood covering his lips and mouth. He can barely breathe.]

I got to say something to you.


SAM [holding his older sibling upright]

What?


[DEAN's hand rests on SAMMY's shoulder but as he talks he moves it to hold his head. The brother's eyes never leave each other.]

I'm proud of us.


[SAM eyes tear up as he looks into DEAN's fading green eyes. DEAN's hand falls from SAM's face and he closes his eyes and falls into little brother's chest.]


SAM

No, no. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, wake up, buddy.

[SAM pulls DEAN back up but DEAN is already gone. SAM grasps his bloody face with both hands and gently shakes]

Hey.

Dean.

Dean!

[Tears fall down SAM's face as he breaks down completely. He gathers DEAN's head to his chest and holds him tightly as he sobs heart-wrenching sobs that echo in the warehouse.]


ACT FIVE


[CASTIEL and HANNAH lock up METATRON in a prison cell in Heaven]


HANNAH

You're doing the right thing -- letting him live. It's what a leader would do.


CASTIEL

I'm no leader, Hannah. I never was. I just want to be an angel.


HANNAH

And Your Grace? What will you do about that? You will die if you don't replenish it.


[CASTIEL's face reveals his has no plan right now.]


[In the Men of Letter's bunker, SAM gently lays DEAN's body on his bed. DEAN's face is clean of all the blood. SAM stands up and he eyes are all puffy and red. He stares silently at his brother's body but tears well up in his eyes.

SAM sits at the table in the dark in the main room. He drinks an entire shot of whiskey.

SAM walks into dungeon with all the summoning spell ingredients still sitting on the floor like DEAN left them.]

SAM

Damn it, Crowley. You got him into this mess. You will get him out... or so help me, God.


[In DEAN's room, CROWLEY stands and gazes at his body.]


CROWLEY

Your brother, bless his soul, is summoning me as I speak. Make a deal, bring you back. It's exactly what I was talking about, isn't it? It's all become so... expected. You have to believe me. When I suggested you take on the Mark of Cain, I didn't know this was going to happen. Not really. I mean, I might not have told you the entire truth. But I never lied. I never lied, Dean. That's important. It's fundamental. But...there is one story about Cain that I might have... forgotten to tell you. Apparently, he, too, was willing to accept death, rather than becoming the killer the Mark wanted him to be. So he took his own life with the Blade. He died. Except, as rumor has it, the Mark never quite let go. You can understand why I never spoke of this. Why set hearts aflutter at mere speculation? It wasn't until you summoned me... No, it wasn't truly until you left that cheeseburger uneaten...that I began to let myself believe. Maybe miracles do come true.


[CROWLEY moves to the bed and places the First Blade into DEAN's right hand and lays them both on DEAN's chest.]


Listen to me, Dean Winchester, what you're feeling right now -- it's not death. It's life -- a new kind of life. Open your eyes, Dean. See what I see. Feel what I feel. And let's go take a howl at that moon.


[The camera hovers over DEAN's face...and when he opens his eyes, they are BLACK]
