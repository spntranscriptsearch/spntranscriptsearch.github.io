NOW
EXT. PARK – DAY


Oklahoma City, Oklahoma


A MAN wearing a suit and a wedding ring sits at a park picnic table and sends a text message on his cell phone. Message sent, he sets the phone down and fingers his wedding ring.


YOUNG WOMAN
Gary?


A YOUNG WOMAN walks up behind him. GARY stands up and faces her.


GARY
Olivia. After last time I – I didn’t think that you would come.


OLIVIA
I wasn’t going to, but...


GARY
I’m glad you did.


OLIVIA
So am I.


OLIVIA takes GARY’s hands and they smile at each other. We hear a muted thumping noise.


OLIVIA
Do you hear that?


GARY
What?


OLIVIA
The thumping noise. Is – is that you?


GARY
You can hear that?


GARY groans and bends over slightly, in pain.


OLIVIA
Gary!


GARY puts a hand to his chest.


GARY
Aah!


OLIVIA
Gary!


GARY falls back towards the picnic table, gasping in pain.


OLIVIA
Gary, what is it?


GARY sits on the bench and pulls his shirt open.


OLIVIA
Gary! Gary!


GARY’s heart is thumping dramatically in his chest, pulling his skin upwards in a cookie-cutter heart shape. GARY groans and OLIVIA screams. OLIVIA is splattered with blood.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. GAS ’N SIP – DAY


SAM is talking on the phone while filling the IMPALA. CASTIEL is leaning against the front of the car.


SAM (on phone)
Right, yeah. No, just, uh – just call us whenever you find something. [DEAN walks out of the store.] Yeah. Yeah, course. [DEAN removes the tops from two bottles of beer.] Right. No, I – I, uh... [DEAN hands SAM a beer.] Yeah, hey, you know what? Uh, Dean's here. He really wants to talk to you.


SAM hands the phone to DEAN.


DEAN (on phone)
Ms. Tran, yeah, hi, uh... [He hangs up and tosses the phone back to SAM.]


DEAN
Tunnel. What's going on in Tran-land?


SAM
Well, uh, Garth finally got them to his houseboat, but Kevin's having a lot of trouble reading their half of the tablet. So far, bits and pieces. Nothing about boarding up Hell.


DEAN
Garth has a safe-houseboat?


SAM
Dude, I don't even ask questions anymore.


SAM takes the gas pump out of the IMPALA. DEAN walks to the front of the car, where CASTIEL is reading a newspaper.


DEAN
What's the word, Cas?


CASTIEL
It's a shortened version of my name.


DEAN
Yes, it is. I meant what's the word on the Word? Any, uh, tablet chatter on angel radio?


CASTIEL
Oh, I couldn't say. I turned that off.


SAM
You can do that?


CASTIEL
Yeah, it's a simple matter of blocking out certain subsonic frequencies. I could draw you a diagram if you want.


DEAN
No, that's – we're good. Why'd you flip the switch?


CASTIEL
Because it's a direct link to Heaven. And I don't want anything to do with that place – not anymore.


DEAN
So what now? Move to Vermont, open up a charming B&B?


CASTIEL
No. I still want – I still need to help people. So... [smiles] I'm gonna become a hunter.


SAM
Really?


CASTIEL
Yeah. I could be your third wheel.


DEAN
You know that's not a good thing, right?


CASTIEL
Of course it is. A third wheel adds extra grip, greater stability. I even found a case. Oklahoma City – a man's heart jumped 10 feet out of his chest. It sounds like our kind of thing, right?


SAM
He's got a point.


CASTIEL
Excellent. [He raps the car and turns away.] I'll see you there.


DEAN
Wait, Cas, Cas! If you want to play cowboys and bloodsuckers, that's fine. But you're gonna stick with us, okay? None of this zapping around crap. Capiche?


CASTIEL
Yeah, I capiche.


DEAN
All right, then. [He walks to the driver’s door.]


CASTIEL
Can I, uh, at least ride in the front seat?


DEAN and SAM simultaneously
[SAM while shouldering CASTIEL out of the way] No.


DEAN and SAM get into the front seats. CASTIEL opens the door behind SAM.


INT. POLICE MORGUE – DAY


A body covered with a sheet lies on a table.


DETECTIVE
Coroner said his heart was ejected from his body. Got some air, too. Found it in a sandbox.


SAM and DEAN are wearing their FBI suits, CASTIEL his trenchcoat.


SAM
Any idea what happened, Detective?


DETECTIVE
A lot of people are thinking drugs, Agent Nash – an assload of drugs.


CASTIEL
[to DEAN] There are no narcotics in that man's system. His molecules are all wrong.


SAM
But you don't think that, huh?


DETECTIVE
Never seen an eightball do that.


The DETECTIVE pulls back the sheet to reveal the cookie-cutter heart-shaped hole in GARY’s chest.


SAM
Wow. And who called this in?


DETECTIVE
Friend of his named Olivia Kopple. She saw the whole thing. [She pulls the sheet back up. Her phone rings.] Oh. [She looks at the caller ID.] Ah, crap. I have – I have to take this. Here's everything we got. [She hands SAM a file.] Knock yourself out.


SAM
Thanks.


DEAN
Listen, you see anything weird, anything out of the box, you give us a call. [He hands the DETECTIVE a card.]


DETECTIVE
Whatever you say, Scully.


DETECTIVE (on phone)
Detective Glass. On my way.


SAM reads the file.


CASTIEL
I can't sense any EMF or sulfur. Mr. Freleng's arterial health is, uh, excellent. [He leans over the corpse and sniffs.] Mm. He did recently suffer from a... [sniffs] ...mild, uh... [sniffs] What is that? ...bladder infection.


DEAN
Cas, stop smelling the dead guy.


CASTIEL
Why? Now I know everything about this man. So we can –


SAM
Do you know he was having an affair?


CASTIEL
What?


DEAN
Strike one, Sherlock.


SAM
According to Olivia, they would meet at the park every Thursday at 12:45, walk to the Moonlight diner, where she always ordered a Caesar salad, dressing on the side. They would chat about everything, and she'd be back on the road by 1:30.


CASTIEL
You don't think she's telling the truth.


DEAN
Too much detail. Sounds rehearsed.


SAM
Plus, we drove past the Moonlight diner on the way into town. It's attached to the Moonlight motel.


DEAN
Okay, well, let's say that, uh, Gary here's on the prowl, but he's playing it safe because... [he lifts GARY’s left hand out from under the sheet and sees his wedding ring] ...dude's married. Doesn't want anyone to see his ride parked out in front of a by-the-hour fleabag.


SAM
So he stashes his car at the park across the street, meets Olivia there.


DEAN
His wife probably found out about it, and it broke her heart.


SAM
So she breaks his. Sounds witchy.


DEAN
Yes, it does. Guy was living a lie, and it came back to bite him in the ticker. But nice job on the bladder infection.


DEAN walks away, and CASTIEL follows him. The camera zooms in on SAM’s face.


FLASHBACK


INT. HOUSE – DAY


SAM is sitting on the couch next to RIOT, unpacking a box of books. He takes out an album titled “Amelia and Don Forever” and is about to open it when AMELIA comes into the room.


AMELIA
He said he'd be here by 5:00.


SAM
[stands up and walks over to AMELIA] Uh, just, deep breath. It's gonna be okay. [He smiles at her.]


AMELIA
I know. It's just this house, you – he's gonna think we're moving too fast. Are we moving too fast?


SAM
[pause] We're making up for lost time.


SAM kisses AMELIA. There is a knock at the door. AMELIA exhales sharply.


AMELIA
Don't talk politics. Don't say anything bad about the Cowboys. And whatever you do, don't – do not use the words "moist" or "irregardless."


SAM
There goes my opener.


AMELIA opens the door.


AMELIA
Hi, Dad!


AMELIA’S FATHER
[laughs and hugs her] Ohh, munchkin!


AMELIA
Okay, embarrassing.


AMELIA’S FATHER
That is my job, kiddo. [He looks at SAM, then away.] So, who's this handsome fella? [SAM smiles, but AMELIA’S FATHER walks over to RIOT.] Yeah, he's a good boy! How you doing there? You're beautiful.


AMELIA
That good boy belongs to this good boy. Stan Thompson, this is Sam Winchester.


STAN
Hi. [They shake hands.] I heard a lot about you.


SAM
Not all bad, I hope.


STAN
[laughs] So, this is a nice place. Lawn could use a mow.


AMELIA
Sam found it. I've been so busy lately. He's had to move us in by himself, pretty much.


STAN
Huh. Job almost well done.


AMELIA
Do you want a drink, Dad? We have beer, iced tea –


STAN
Anything cold will be fantastic. Thank you, sweetheart.


AMELIA
Okay.


SAM
Mr. Thompson, um, I just – I know this must be weird. Uh, you haven't seen Amelia in months, and now she's living with a guy you've never met.


STAN
Ame said you went to Stanford.


SAM
I did.


STAN
It's a good school.


SAM
It is.


STAN
So what do you do now?


SAM
I work at a motel in town.


STAN
Ah. Balancing the books?


SAM
Uh, no. Maintenance, mostly.


STAN
Ah. Well, that makes sense. 'Cause I got to say, Sam, you look like a real fixer-upper to me.


SAM looks taken aback and uncomfortable. The flashback ends.


EXT. HOUSE – DAY


The IMPALA is parked outside a suburban house.


WOMAN (V-O)
I – I don't understand.


INT. FRELING HOUSE – DAY


MRS FRELENG, wearing black, is sitting at the table in front of a box of Kleenex.


MRS FRELING
Gary had a heart attack. Why would the FBI –


DEAN
The parks are government property. We just got a few questions for you.


CASTIEL
[to DEAN and SAM] I'll, uh... I'll handle this. I've done research. I can crack her. [leaning over next to MRS FRELENG] Now, Ms. Freleng, I don't want to bother you. I – I really don't. But I – I do have just one question for you. [slams table] Why did you kill your husband?!


DEAN
Agent Stills. A word, please.


MRS FRELENG sobs. CASTIEL walks over to DEAN.


CASTIEL
What? I was being bad cop.


DEAN
No, you were being bad everything.


SAM
Please, forgive my partner. [He sits down at the table opposite MRS FRELENG.] He's, uh – he's going through some stuff.


DEAN
[to CASTIEL] Listen to Sam.


SAM
What he was trying to ask – is – is there any way Gary might have had secrets – something he was hiding?


MRS FRELENG
Hiding? Like what?


There is a knock at the door and someone lets themself in.


OLIVIA
Deb?


OLIVIA enters, carrying a casserole. MRS FRELENG walks towards her.


MRS FRELENG
Olivia.


OLIVIA
Hey.


MRS FRELENG and OLIVIA hug, both crying.


OLIVIA
Are you okay?


DEAN
As in mistress Olivia?


CASTIEL
This is awkward.


MRS FRELENG
[with an arm around OLIVIA] I'm sorry. W-what did you think Gary was hiding?


CASTIEL
That he was sleeping with her.


MRS FRELENG
I know.


SAM
You know?


MRS FRELENG
Gary and I – we... had an arrangement. He was seeing Olivia, and I was spending some time with our neighbor P.J.


OLIVIA
I'll, uh – I'll put this in the kitchen.


MRS FRELENG
I'll help.


OLIVIA
Yeah.


MRS FRELENG
Okay.


MRS FRELENG and OLIVIA leave the room.


DEAN
Frigging suburbs, man.


CASTIEL
So she's not a witch.


DEAN
Just the best wife ever.


CASTIEL
Then what killed her husband?


DEAN
Who gives a- [The scene abruptly changes before Dean can finish his sentence]


EXT. TOP OF CITY BUILDING – DAY


A car horn blares. The camera looks down from the top of a building. A MAN is standing on the edge of the building, looking down at the street below. He starts to cry and taps his feet. He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and steps off the building. Instead of falling, he is suspended in mid-air as if he were standing on an invisible platform. The MAN opens his eyes and looks around in shock.


MAN
It's a miracle! God wants me to live!


The MAN laughs joyfully, looking up at the sky. He then looks down and falls. We hear a screech of brakes and a siren.

ACT TWO
EXT. TOP OF CITY BUILDING – DAY


SAM looks over the edge of the building to the street below, then walks over to DETECTIVE GLASS and DEAN. CASTIEL is standing some distance away.


SAM
Looks like suicide.


DETECTIVE GLASS
It was. Guy left a note. He invested everything in Roman Industries and lost it all when they crashed and burned last year.


DEAN
So why call us?


DETECTIVE GLASS
Because I have two witnesses who swear that Madoff here floated in mid-air for a good 10 seconds, then he looked down, and splat. Not sure I buy that, but the way they're talking, it sounds like something straight out of a –


DEAN
Cartoon.


MAN
Hey, Detective.


DETECTIVE GLASS
You said you wanted weird.


DEAN
Thanks.


DETECTIVE GLASS walks away and CASTIEL joins DEAN and SAM.


DETECTIVE GLASS
Yeah, what do you got?


DEAN
She's right, you know. I mean, the whole heart jumping out of the guy's chest, the – the – the delayed fall – that's straight-up Bugs Bunny.


CASTIEL
So we're looking for some sort of insect-rabbit hybrid? How do we kill it?


SAM
No, we don't, Cas. That's a character, like, uh – like Woody Woodpecker or Daffy Duck.


DEAN
They're little animated movies. You know, uh, the coyote chases a roadrunner, and then the – [laughs] the anvil gets dropped on his head. [SAM smiles.]


CASTIEL
Is it supposed to be funny?


DEAN
[unsmiling] No. It's hilarious.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


CASTIEL is sitting on the edge of a bed watching a cartoon on television.


VOICE ON TV
Stay tuned, kids! We'll be right back!


CASTIEL laughs and turns off the television. SAM and DEAN are sitting at the table, SAM using the laptop and DEAN reading.


CASTIEL
I understand. The bird represents God. And coyote is man, endlessly chasing the divine, yet never able to catch him. It's... It's hilarious.


DEAN
I got no idea what we're hunting. Maybe it's a Tulpa. Maybe it's some – some crazy god who watched too much "Robot Chicken." I – I – I mean, is there a link between "Heartbreak Hotel" and "Free Fallin'"?


SAM
Not that I can find.


DEAN
All right, well, I'm gonna call it. [He closes the journal he was reading.] Cas, you gonna book a room or what?


CASTIEL
No, I'll stay here.


DEAN
Oh, okay. Yeah. We'll have a slumber party, braid Sam's hair. Where are you gonna sleep?


CASTIEL
I don't sleep.


DEAN
Okay, well, I need my four hours, so...


CASTIEL
I'll watch over you.


DEAN
That's not gonna happen.


CASTIEL stands up and puts a hand to his temple.


CASTIEL
Something's coming across the police band.


SAM
Wait, you can hear that?


CASTIEL
It's all waves. A bank has been robbed. It sounds loony.


DEAN
Define "loony."


INT. BANK – NIGHT


A 1-ton anvil stands in the middle of the bank. Underneath it is a bloody mass.


SAM
That's loony, all right.


CASTIEL is inspecting a card machine at the personal teller desk. DETECTIVE GLASS walks over to SAM and DEAN.


DETECTIVE GLASS
Agents. I was just about to give you a ring. Got to ask – do you boys chase the crazy, or does the crazy chase you?


SAM
Depends on the day.


DEAN
Who's the pancake?


DETECTIVE GLASS
Security guard. He called in reporting a robbery, but by the time we got here –


SAM
A robbery?


DETECTIVE GLASS
Looks like the “Black Hole” was trying to jimmy open a safe-deposit box when Mr. Rent-A-Cop found him. And, well... [a crime scene investigator takes a picture of a large black circle on a wall] ...you know how that story ends.


CASTIEL
Black hole?


DETECTIVE GLASS
It's our name for a burglar that's been running us ragged. He's a pro – no fingerprints, never any sign of forced entry – just a pair of those every time... [the camera pans to one of the large black circles] ...like he's signing his work. Perp's never done anything like this before, though... obviously.


SAM
You mind if I take a look at your files on those other break-ins?


DETECTIVE GLASS
No skin off my nose. I'm headed to the station now if you want a ride.


SAM
Perfect.


SAM follows DETECTIVE GLASS out of the bank.


DEAN
Hey. Can you lift this?


CASTIEL moves the anvil. An “X” is marked on the floor underneath it.


DEAN
"X" marks the spot. Well, whoever's doing this is playing by cartoon rules.


CASTIEL
Animation doesn't have rules.


DEAN
Sure it does. In Toontown, a – a pretty girl can make your heart leap out of your chest, anvils fall from the sky, and if you draw a door or a black hole on the wall, you can stroll right through it.


They walk over to one of the black circles on the wall.


CASTIEL
So this is how the thief got in.


DEAN
And out. And cracked the vault.


CASTIEL touches the black circle. The wall behind it is solid.


CASTIEL
Then why isn't it working now?


DEAN
I got no clue.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


DEAN is using the laptop at the table. CASTIEL is sitting on one of the beds, looking at John’s journal.


CASTIEL
Your father... Beautiful handwriting.


DEAN
How you feeling, Cas?


CASTIEL
I'm fine.


DEAN
Well, I just – I – I know that when... I got puked out of Purgatory, it took me a few weeks to... find my sea legs.


CASTIEL
I'm fine.


DEAN
Don't get me wrong. I'm – I’m happy you're back. I'm – I’m freaking thrilled. It's just this whole mysterious-resurrection thing – it always has one mother of a downside.


CASTIEL
[closes the journal] So, what do you want me to do?


DEAN
Maybe take a trip upstairs.


CASTIEL
To Heaven?


DEAN
Yeah, poke around, see if the God squad can't tell us how you got out.


CASTIEL
No.


DEAN
Look, man, I – I hate those flying-ass monkeys just as much as you do, but –


CASTIEL
[forcefully] Dean! I said no!


After a pause, DEAN closes the laptop, walks over and sits on the edge of the other bed, facing CASTIEL.


DEAN
Talk to me.


CASTIEL
Dean, I... When I was... bad... and I had all those things – the... the leviathans... writhing inside me... I caused a lot of suffering on earth, but I devastated Heaven. I vaporized thousands of my own kind, and I – I – I can't go back.


DEAN
'Cause if you do, the angels will kill you.


CASTIEL
Because if I see what Heaven's become – what I – [sighs] what I made of it... I'm afraid I might kill myself.


SAM enters the room.


SAM
Hey. Got something.


CASTIEL
Good. [He stands up. DEAN stays sitting on the bed a few moments longer.] Excellent. What?


SAM
So this black-hole guy – before he tried the bank, he robbed a house across from the park where Gary blew a gasket.


DEAN
So, uh, what – you think the house heist and Gary's corpse are connected?


SAM
According to the file, they happened at pretty much the exact same time. Here. Check this out. Okay. [He spreads out a map on which “X”’s are marked in three clusters.] Here's the house, and Gary died across the street here. And that building from this morning – right there. The black hole hit that, too.


DEAN
Let me guess – where, uh, what's his name took a swan dive. [SAM nods.] All right. I'll bite. What about the others?


SAM
Well, those are the places that stuff got stolen. But nobody got dead. Take away the graffiti, and these all look like just normal smash-and-grabs. But I made a few phone calls... [He holds out a police file, which CASTIEL takes] ...talked to some people who are nearby – neighbors and whatnot – and they reported a whole lot of crazy.


DEAN
Like?


SAM
Like a jogger bumping his head and sprouting a four-inch lump. Or a kid walking into a wall and hearing birdies. Basically, for 50 yards around each robbery, people were living in a cartoon. But it didn't last long – I mean 5, 10 minutes at each place.


CASTIEL
About the length of time it would take a thief to get in and out.


SAM
Exactly. But whatever power he's using, it's – it's – it’s not targeted. I mean, it's – it's kind of like an area of effect. I mean, picture him in a – in a bubble of weird, and anything that touches it gets daffy.


DEAN
So this Animaniac can step through walls, can toss an anvil?


SAM
Yeah, but he's warping reality to do it. So if someone happens to be nearby meeting the girl of his dreams...


DEAN
His heart makes a break for it. [SAM raises a hand in agreement.] Okay, so smashing the, uh – the rent-a-cop – that – that was on purpose, but the rest of them – what, is that just collateral weird?


SAM
Maybe.


CASTIEL
So we're looking for a thief.


SAM
And the deposit box he was after. Now, the house, the office – every place he's hit belonged to someone living at the Sunset Fields retirement home.


DEAN
So you think our guy's there.


SAM
Worth a shot.


DEAN
All right. Well, let's gear up. It's wabbit season.


SAM smiles.


CASTIEL
I don't think you pronounced that correctly.


INT. SUNSET FIELDS RETIREMENT HOME – DAY


DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL walk into a large room in which residents are sitting at tables. They pass an old man using a walker and wearing a breathing mask, who nods to them. DEAN makes a face after the old man has gone by.


SAM
Come on. It's not that bad.


DEAN
You can't tell me this joint doesn't give you the heebs and/or jeebs.


SAM smiles. A MAN in a suit walks up to them.


MAN
Hello.


DEAN
Hi.


MAN
Can I help you?


DEAN
Yeah. [SAM and DEAN hold up their FBI badges.] Agent Crosby. FBI.


MAN
Sorry, I'm Dr. Dwight Mahoney. I run Sunset Fields.


CASTIEL
We need to question your residents.


DR MAHONEY
Well... why? About what?


SAM
Grand larceny, mostly.


DEAN looks around DR MAHONEY at placid-looking residents playing chess.


DR MAHONEY
Of course. Um, by all means, ask away. If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.


SAM
Appreciate it.


DEAN
Great.


DEAN
All right, let's do this. No flirting, you two.


CUT TO:


OLD WOMAN
You are so pretty, Charles.


DEAN and CASTIEL are at a table talking to an OLD WOMAN. DEAN notices an attractive female CARER walk by.


CASTIEL
That's not my name.


OLD WOMAN
Oh! You look so much like my third husband.


DEAN
We're here to talk about the robbery, ma'am.


OLD WOMAN
Robbery?


DEAN
Mm-hmm. The one the police talked to you about a few days ago. Someone broke into your old house and, uh, stole a stack of bearer bonds and, uh, some jewelry that you stashed under your floorboards.


OLD WOMAN
Oh, my diamonds, yes. I hid them there. [to CASTIEL] I'm sorry, Charles. I didn't trust you. You were quite the bounder.


DEAN smiles at CASTIEL, amused.


DEAN
Did you tell anyone where your valuables were, Mrs. Tate?


MRS TATE
I don't think so. But then I get a little fuzzy sometimes.


DEAN
Have you noticed anything strange lately – uh, cold spots, smells?


MRS TATE
Well, there's the cat. [She points.]


DEAN
The cat?


A ginger CAT is on a nearby couch, being stroked by another resident.


MRS TATE
He talks sometimes. Really hates that mouse.


CASTIEL
I'll interrogate the cat.


CASTIEL leaves the table. MRS TATE smiles at DEAN.


CUT TO:


An OLD MAN is sitting at a table in front of a tray of food, staring vacantly.


ORDERLY
You all done here? [The OLD MAN doesn’t respond.] All right.


The ORDERLY takes the tray and walks over to SAM, who is standing nearby.


ORDERLY
It's creepy, right? A lot of these people – they just tune out and live in their own heads. It's like maybe the real world is too much for them, and they just run and hide, you know?


SAM
Hmm.


We see a close-up of SAM’s face, which fades into a flashback.


FLASHBACK


INT. SAM AND AMELIA’S HOUSE – DAY (late afternoon / early evening)


SAM and STAN are sitting at the table, which is set for dinner. AMELIA walks to the table carrying a large bowl.


AMELIA
Soup's on... and semi-edible.


AMELIA sets the bowl down. It contains spaghetti and sliced hotdogs.


STAN
[laughs] You remembered.


AMELIA
Dad was in the army, so we moved around a lot when I was a kid. Having spaghetti and hot dogs our first night in a new house was sort of a tradition.


SAM
All right. Got it. Uh, my father was in the Marines.


STAN
Jarhead, huh?


SAM
That's right. Uh, 2nd battalion, First Marines, Echo company.


STAN
I always thought they were a little puffed up, myself. But, hey. What do I know? I'm just an old grunt.


AMELIA
You're my old grunt.


AMELIA puts a hand on STAN’s shoulder and then walks back to the kitchen.


STAN
So, Ame tells me you never served.


SAM
No.


STAN
See, I find that hard to believe, 'cause I got to say, Sam, you got the look.


SAM
The look?


STAN
The one a lot of guys get after they've been through the meat grinder – the one that lets you know they've seen a lot of crap they can't forget. The second their feet hit solid ground, they start running, and they don't stop – not till they find something to hold on to.


SAM
You think that's what I'm doing here? Just holding on?


STAN
I think the two of you are holding on to each other, yeah. 'Cause I know she's scared. After what happened to Don, I don't blame her for taking off. Needing to run away and hide – I know why she did it. The question is – what are you running from, Sam?


The flashback ends.


INT. SUNSET FIELDS RETIREMENT HOME – DAY


DEAN walks up to SAM.


DEAN
Hey, what do you got?


SAM
Hey, um, nothing. Uh, no hex bags, no EMF. You?


DEAN
Nada. Half the folks I talked to don't even remember being robbed.


SAM looks at photographs of Sunset Fields residents on the wall. The camera focuses on a picture of FRED JONES.


SAM
Dean, um... You remember a guy named Fred Jones? I think he was a contact of Dad's, lived outside of Salt Lake.


DEAN
Yeah, that guy gave me my first beer. I don't even think I was double digits.


SAM
Right, yeah. Me, too. Um, he was psychic, right?


DEAN
Psychokinetic. Why?


SAM
'Cause he's in room 114. [He points to FRED’s picture.]


DEAN
Cas. Let's go.


CASTIEL is crouched down in front of the CAT, which is now lying on a coffee table.


CASTIEL
I've almost cracked him.


DEAN
Now. [He and SAM walk away.]


CASTIEL
Hey. [He holds up a finger to the cat.] I'm not through with you.


CASTIEL follows DEAN and SAM.


CAT
Dumbass.


CUT TO:


A cartoon plays on television. The character draws an “X” on the floor. FRED is watching. There is a knock at the door, which FRED doesn’t respond to. The camera pans out and we see that FRED is sitting in a wheelchair in his room, watching a television mounted high on the wall. SAM and DEAN enter.


SAM
Mr. Jones? Hey, it's, uh, Sam Winchester. [He crouches down next to FRED’s wheelchair.]


DEAN
Fred?


CARTOON ON TELEVISION
My nerves! Get me a doctor!


DEAN switches off the television.


DEAN
Fred! Hey! [He claps his hands twice.]


FRED continues staring up at the television.


CASTIEL
So, you really think this one man is causing all of these... shenanigans?


DEAN
Well, if he is, he'd be surrounded by a circle of crazy, right? Hang on.


DEAN picks up a large book and hits himself in the head with it. There is a loud clanging sound, then the sound of birds chirping. DEAN then shakes his head rapidly from side to side.


DEAN
[cartoon voice] Brrrr. [normal voice] Bingo.


CASTIEL
But how?


SAM
Fred's got juice. I mean, an average psychokinetic can move things with his mind, but a guy like Fred – you get him worked up, he can reshape reality.


DEAN
All right, so where's his "off" switch?


SAM
I don't know. I'm not even certain if he knows we're here.


FRED is still staring up at the turned-off television.


CASTIEL
Do we... kill him?


DR MAHONEY
Excuse me, Agents. [DR MAHONEY is now standing in the room, with the ORDERLY.] Did he just threaten to murder one of my patients?


CUT TO:


SAM, DEAN and CASTIEL walk down the hallway.


DEAN
Real freaking smooth.


CASTIEL
Well, we don't have to leave him. I could teleport him.


SAM
Fred's radioactive, Cas. You zap him – no telling what will happen.


DEAN
Me and Sam will circle back tonight, get Fred nice and clean. You go “Invisible Girl” and keep an eye on him. You hear me?


CASTIEL disappears. SAM and DEAN turn to look behind them.


DEAN
Good.


INT. SUNSET FIELDS RETIREMENT HOME – DAY


Someone wearing a diamond bracelet lights a sparkler candle with a cigarette lighter. MRS TATE smiles excitedly. The camera pans out and we see that the person lighting the candle is the CARER and that residents of the retirement home are gathered around a birthday cake. FRED sits nearby in his wheelchair, staring vacantly and tapping one finger on his thigh. Each time he taps, the program playing on the television in front of him changes. We see brief clips of a cooking program, scuba divers and elephants.


WOMAN’S VOICE
The birthday girl!


CARER
Happy Birthday, Sheila.


The residents gathered around the birthday cake are wearing party hats and chatting happily.


MAN’S VOICE
The birthday girl!


FRED taps his finger again and the television program changes to a cartoon in which Woody Woodpecker lights a large candle-shaped fuse.


FEMALE RESIDENT
Ha. Good.


On the television, Woody Woodpecker hands the fuse to an ape wearing a bonnet, who licks it.


CARER
Get ready. Big breath. Ready?


MRS TATE stands up and takes a deep breath. She blows out the candle. People scream as the cake explodes. Frosting covers the television and the wall.


ACT THREE
INT. SUNSET FIELDS RETIREMENT HOME – DAY


CASTIEL stands near the exploded cake. The CARER wipes MRS TATE’s face with a towel.


CARER
I'm just gonna wipe this off your face, okay? [She picks up a breathing mask.] I'm just gonna put this on.


DEAN arrives.


CASTIEL
Oh. You got my message. Good.


DEAN
What the hell happened?


CASTIEL
There was a pastry mishap.


DEAN
Okay, and?


CASTIEL
And the frosting reached near-supersonic speeds. I thought –


SAM joins CASTIEL and DEAN.


SAM
Hey.


DEAN
Hey.


SAM
Fred's gone.


CASTIEL
What?


DEAN
Oh, fan-freaking-tastic. [to CASTIEL] Way to take your eye off the ball.


The CARER pushes MRS TATE in her wheelchair towards DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL.


CARER
You're not supposed to be here.


DEAN
Well, trust me, sweetheart, you got bigger fish.


MRS TATE
[removing her breathing mask, to CASTIEL] Charles, she's wearing my diamonds.


The CARER tries to push MRS TATE past DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL, but CASTIEL stops her.


CASTIEL
Wait.


CARER
What? What's wrong?


CASTIEL
[holding the CARER’s wrist] This is Mrs. Tate's bracelet. [MRS TATE smiles.] Where did you get it?


DEAN
Answer the question.


CARER
My boyfriend gave it to me.


INT. HOUSE – NIGHT


DEAN and SAM enter and look around with flashlights. CASTIEL is behind them.


DEAN
Hey. [He picks up a piece of paper.] Bearer bonds. Maybe these belonged to Sheila Tate.


CASTIEL
So this man is our thief.


SAM
Yeah. [He sees someone lying on the floor behind an upturned table, and points his gun.] Dean.


The person on the floor is the ORDERLY. He has blood on his face and is holding his hands over a stomach wound. DEAN turns on the light and the ORDERLY lifts his head. DEAN moves the table. The ORDERLY coughs.


DEAN
Cas.


CASTIEL crouches down next to the ORDERLY.


CASTIEL
Stay still. Move your hands.


CASTIEL holds a hand out over the ORDERLY’s stomach. White light emanates from his hand. He presses on ORDERLY’S stomach and the ORDERLY gasps and moves as if in pain. CASTIEL stands up. The ORDERLY lifts his shirt. Blood remains on his hands and stomach, but his wound is healed.


ORDERLY
How did you...


DEAN
Guy eats his Wheaties. Sam, come on.


ORDERLY
What did you...


DEAN
Get up. [He and SAM lift the ORDERLY and push him into a chair.] Come on. Sit down.


ORDERLY
Wait a second! What did you just do to me?!


DEAN
Hey, hey, hey! Listen to me. Where is Fred Jones?


ORDERLY
I – he – he took him.


DEAN
Who?


VEHICLE – NIGHT


A cartoon featuring a doctor plays on a tablet computer. The cartoon doctor hangs a sign that reads “Doctor Is In” on a door.


ORDERLY (V-O)
Dr. Mahoney. That guy's evil, man, okay?


The camera pans out and we see that FRED is holding the computer tablet in a vehicle driven by DR MAHONEY.


ORDERLY (V-O)
He's using Mr. Jones.


SAM (V-O)
How?


INT. HOUSE – NIGHT


ORDERLY
Look, all Fred does is watch cartoons, but he is magic, okay? A few weeks ago, I – I slammed my foot in his door. I smashed it flat – and I mean flat. And then when I shook the thing, it popped back up, like something out of a cartoon or whatever.


DEAN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know.


ORDERLY
So I told Dr. Mahoney, and then he started doing experiments. Just – we just wanted to see what he could do.


SAM
What about the robberies?


ORDERLY
Oh, Mahoney's been skimming off Sunset Fields for years. A lot of those folks – they got stuff stashed away, like, off the books, like. So Mahoney would track down the loot, and then we would take Fred for a drive.


DEAN
Right, and use his bubble of weird to rip people off. How did you end up gut-shot?


ORDERLY
Mahoney – after – after he anviled that guard, he started freaking out, and then – then you showed up, and then the cake blew in the day room, and then he lost it.


SAM
What does that mean, "he lost it"?


ORDERLY
I mean he's on his way back to the bank right now for one last score. Doc's blowing town. I mean, he said that Fred was a loose end. He was gonna kill him. And then, I – I like Fred, so I said that if he hurt the guy, I'd go to the cops. And I didn't know that he had a gun.


DEAN
Okay.


EXT. STREET – NIGHT


DEAN, CASTIEL and SAM walk to the IMPALA.


CASTIEL
Do you think Mr. Jones knows what's happening?


DEAN
I don't know. Seems to me like the dude's living in a dream world.


They get into the IMPALA. We see a close-up of SAM’s face.


FLASHBACK


INT. SAM AND AMELIA’S HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM is washing dishes in the kitchen. STAN and AMELIA are talking quietly in the adjoining main room as AMELIA clears dishes from the table.


STAN
Look, I am trying to help. Boy, I'll tell you, if Don could see you...


AMELIA
[looks over her shoulder at SAM] Don't. Just don't.


STAN
[looks over his shoulder at SAM] You can't – you need to come home.


SAM watches them from the kitchen.


AMELIA
Is that why you're here – to drag me back? This is my life.


STAN
This – it won't last. You are living in a dream world.


SAM turns back to the sink.


AMELIA
I like it here. I like this house. I like Sam.


STAN
Sam is a mess.


AMELIA
I'm a mess. But when I'm with Sam, I'm happy, Dad. And I haven't been happy in a really long time. So please, just... let us be messes together. Give us a chance.


AMELIA brings dishes into the kitchen and smiles at SAM before going back out to the dining table. STAN carries wine glasses into the kitchen and goes to the sink to stand next to SAM.


STAN
I'll dry. Is that your car outside – the Impala?


SAM
Yeah, it was my dad's.


STAN
Guy had good taste... for a jarhead.


STAN smiles, but SAM doesn’t smile back. SAM rubs his left palm, which he cut in 7.01 Meet the New Boss and which DEAN pressed on in 7.02 Hello, Cruel World to help ground SAM to reality. SAM subsequently used the technique during Season 7 to distract himself from his hallucinations of LUCIFER. The flashback ends.


EXT. ALLEYWAY – NIGHT


DEAN, SAM and CASTIEL get out of the IMPALA and walk down the alleyway.


DEAN
All right. Jones has got to be close. I'll hit the bank. You see if you can find him.


DEAN stops in front of a large black circle on the wall of a building. He lifts a hand and tentatively reaches out towards the circle. His fingers penetrate the wall and he quickly pulls them back. He looks at his hand and reaches into the circle again, inserting his arm up to his elbow. He laughs and pulls him arm out of the circle.


DEAN
Awesome.


EXT. STREET – NIGHT


SAM and CASTIEL hurry along the street. SAM pauses to look behind a parked car, then continues on.


CASTIEL
Can you feel that, Sam? The power.


They look inside a parked van. FRED is inside, watching a cartoon on the tablet computer.


CARTOON VOICE
Calamity Jane for you!


SAM gets in the back of the van with FRED.


SAM
Fred, hey. Fred, hey, buddy. Hey. [He grabs FRED’s hand.] Hey, Fred? Listen to me. Can you hear me? Fred! [to CASTIEL] If we could just talk to him. Hey, buddy. Hey, wake up. Wake up.


CASTIEL puts his hands on FRED’s hand and arm.


SAM
Cas?


White light emanates from CASTIEL’s hands.


SAM
Wait. Wait!


The white light becomes blinding. SAM grimaces and closes his eyes before the entire screen turns white.


ACT FOUR
EXT. DAY


We see a close-up of SAM’s head and upper body against a light blue sky. He looks around, confused, as accordion music plays.


CARTOON VOICE
Aha!


The camera pans out and we see that SAM and CASTIEL are standing in a cartoon desert landscape. A cartoon creature runs along a dirt track between SAM and CASTIEL and continues off into the distance. Just after the creature disappears, there is an explosion over the horizon.


SAM
Cas, uh, where are we?


CASTIEL
Inside Mr. Jones' mind. You said you wanted to talk to him.


FRED is standing with his arms crossed near CASTIEL and SAM.


FRED
Who the hell are you?


The sky shatters into pieces and falls. The desert landscape now appears in overexposed, moving gray and white and there is a loud static noise.


SAM
Fred. Fred. Um, hey, it's – it's – it's me. I'm, uh – I'm Sam – Sam Winchester.


FRED
John's boy?


SAM
That's right.


FRED
The scrawny one? It's only been... [bright color starts to return to the landscape] ...three, four years since I've seen you. [The colors return to mostly gray and white.]


SAM
More like, uh, 20. Uh, listen, Fred, I'm gonna need you to focus.


FRED
How did you... Why are you here, Sam?


INT. BANK – NIGHT


DR MAHONEY removes a safe deposit box via a small black hole. Many other black circles dot the safe deposit box wall and many other deposit boxes are on a table in the vault. DR MAHONEY sets the deposit box down on the table next to an open bag containing jewelry and cash. He opens the box and adds more cash to the bag. DEAN appears and points a gun at him.


DEAN
What's up, Doc?


FRED (V-O)
No, no, no, no, no...


INT. FRED’S MIND – NIGHT

FRED, SAM and CASTIEL are standing in the gray and white desert landscape.


FRED
...no. You're lying!


They now appear to be inside a large, bare room. The light is gray and white as before.


CASTIEL
This is happening, Mr. Jones. They're using you.


FRED
As what – some kind of a damn psychic CopperTop? You plug me in, and the whole world goes wacky? It doesn't work that way.


SAM
How would you know? No offense, but it seems to me like you've been spending more time in here than you have... out there.


FRED
You want to know what's the worst thing that can happen to a guy that's got a mind like I got? Losing it.


INT. BANK – NIGHT


DR MAHONEY
You let me walk, and half of this is yours.


DEAN looks at the bag on the table.


DEAN
I think I'm gonna pass. I'm not really into stealing from sweet old ladies.


DR MAHONEY
I'm not stealing from them. I'm stealing from their children. Little bastards think they can drop their folks off at a home and visit twice a year, maybe. I took care of all these old geezers. I think I deserve –


DEAN
I don't care!


DR MAHONEY
Fine. Have it your way.


DEAN lowers his gun a few inches. DR MAHONEY flings papers at DEAN and pushes him back against the wall. DEAN falls to the ground and DR MAHONEY grabs the bag and runs. DEAN fires. A red and yellow flag with “BANG” written on it pops out of his gun. DR MAHONEY pauses and turns.


DR MAHONEY
Welcome to the fun house.


DEAN stares at the flag for a moment. DR MAHONEY runs off and DEAN follows him.


INT. FRED’S MIND – NIGHT


The background is still the large, bare room with gray and white flickering light.


FRED
Cartoons – yeah, yeah, I always loved them when I was a kid. [The background changes to black and white circles and patterns on the walls.] They made me feel... happy – safe. They were...


The black and white patterns become the gray and white flickering light of before.


SAM
Something to hold on to.


FRED
Yeah.


INT. BANK – NIGHT


DEAN chases DR MAHONEY through the bank. DEAN tackles DR MAHONEY and the frame freezes with DEAN in mid-air, his hands on DR MAHONEY’s shoulders. Captions appear on the screen:


DEAN WINCHESTER

(HUNTERUS HEROICUS)


DR. MAHONEY

(GROTESQUES VILLAINUS)


DEAN and DR MAHONEY crash to the ground. They get up and DR MAHONEY produces a large frying pan from his jacket. He hits DEAN across the face with it three times, then presses it into DEAN’s face. DEAN yells as the image of his face appears in the frying pan. DR MAHONEY lowers the frying pan. DEAN looks dazed. We hear a cuckoo noise, a falling noise and chirping birds as DEAN falls to the ground.


DR MAHONEY
Give up! I've been dealing with this crazy for months! And you – idiot – bring a gun to a gag fight.


DEAN
Yeah, well, I did bring this. [He holds up a can of spray paint.] And "X" marks the spot.


DR MAHONEY looks down and sees that he is standing over an “X” marked on the floor. He looks up and we hear the loud noise of something falling. DR MAHONEY gets out of the way before a large anvil hits the “X”.


SAM (V-O)
I need you to stop this...


INT. FRED’S MIND


The background is the large, bare room with gray and white flickering light.


SAM
...take control.


FRED
It's too hard!


SAM
Look, it can be nice living in a dream world. It can be great. I know that. And you can hide, and you can pretend... [the background is now brightly colored rectangles] ...all the crap out there doesn't exist, but you can't do it forever because... eventually, whatever it is you're running from – it'll find you. [CASTIEL appears to be taking SAM’s words to heart.] It'll come along, and it'll punch you in the gut. And then... then you got to wake up, because if you don't, then trying to keep that dream alive will destroy you! It'll destroy everything!


The background changes to bright white light. We see a close-up of CASTIEL, who disappears into the light.


INT. BANK – NIGHT


DEAN gets up off the floor. DR MAHONEY grabs the bag and runs for a large black circle on the wall. He yells as he runs into the wall and falls to the ground.


DEAN
Looks like somebody turned off the boob tube.


DR MAHONEY
Good. [He pulls out a gun and cocks it.] Means I can use this.


FRED
No! [FRED, SAM and CASTIEL are now standing in the bank. FRED is pointing at DR MAHONEY.] You are never going to hurt anyone again!


DR MAHONEY gasps and the arm with which he is holding the gun with his other hand. Against his will, he points the gun at his own head and fires. SAM and DEAN flinch.


DEAN
Now that's all, folks.


ACT FIVE
INT. BANK – NIGHT


FRED
My God.


SAM
Fred. You good?


FRED
Now I'm good. In a month, year... [sighs] Nobody gets sharper with age. I'm gonna lose control again, and somebody's gonna get hurt... again. [sighs] You got to make it stop.


CASTIEL
There might be a way. The procedure will be painful, and... when it's over, I'm not sure how much of you will be left.


FRED
[takes a deep breath and then speaks decisively] Well, what are you waiting for?


INT. SUNSET FIELDS RETIREMENT HOME – DAY


FRED is sitting in his wheelchair in the day room. SAM, DEAN and CASTIEL stand nearby.


SAM
Is he, uh – is he okay?


CASTIEL
He's listening to "Ode to Joy." [FRED closes his eyes and smiles slightly before opening his eyes again.] He's happy.


DEAN
[small smile] All right, well, let's blow this termite terrace. Cas, you get to ride shotgun. You done good.


CASTIEL
Thanks, but I, uh... I can't come. I, uh...


We hear a siren in the distance and the scene abruptly changes.


INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE IN HEAVEN


NAOMI
Hello, Castiel. And, no.


CASTIEL
No?


NAOMI
I can see what you're thinking, and I won't allow it.


CASTIEL
You don't understand. I have been trying to pretend that I can escape what I did in Heaven, but I can't. All that pain that I caused – I – I have to come back, to make things right.


NAOMI
And you are... by doing what you're told. Bottom line – unless I ring my bell, you stay out of Heaven, Castiel.


CASTIEL
Well, then, what should I do?


NAOMI
What do you want to do?


INT. SUNSET FIELDS RETIREMENT HOME – DAY


SAM
You – you what, Cas? W-why can't you come with us?


CASTIEL
I, um... I want to stay with Mr. Jones. Someone should watch over him for a few days just to be safe.


DEAN
Okay, and then what?


CASTIEL
Then I'm not sure. But I know I can't run anymore.


We see a close-up of SAM’s face that fades into a flashback.


FLASHBACK


INT. SAM AND AMELIA’S HOUSE – NIGHT


SAM, AMELIA and STAN are sitting at the table drinking beer.


STAN
So, Ame is playing the Sugarplum fairy, right? [AMELIA groans and SAM puts a hand on her arm.] Right? Now, this is her big moment, you understand, and she waddles up onto the stage –


AMELIA
Waddles?


STAN
What? You were a chubby kid. It was adorable. Anyway, she waddles up onto the stage, and she is dragging two feet of toilet paper behind her.


SAM
No.


Everybody laughs and AMELIA covers her face.


STAN
You remember that?


AMELIA
Yeah.


The phone rings.


STAN
Officially the end of her career. [AMELIA gets up to answer the phone. STAN indicates an unopened beer on the table.] You want one of these?


SAM
Please, yeah. [STAN opens the beer and hands it to SAM.] Thanks. [STAN opens another beer for himself.] My, uh – my brother used to do that.


STAN
Yeah?


SAM
Yeah.


STAN
He a good guy?


SAM
Yeah. Yeah, uh, he – he was... the best. Uh, I, uh... I lost him, and, uh, I ran.


STAN
I'm sorry to hear about that.


AMELIA (on phone)
What? A-are you sure? Oh, God.


SAM and STAN look at AMELIA, who is standing in the kitchen with her back to them. AMELIA comes slowly back into the main room holding the phone.


STAN
Amelia? Baby? You okay?


AMELIA
It's Don. He's alive.


The flashback ends on a close-up of SAM’s face.


INT. SUNSET FIELDS RETIREMENT HOME – DAY


DEAN
[turning to leave and clapping SAM on the arm] Sam, you with me?


SAM follows DEAN. Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" plays as FRED smiles. CASTIEL pulls up a chair and sits down next to FRED. The scene goes to black in a diminishing circle, cartoon-style.
