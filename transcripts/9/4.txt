TEASER
[Scene opens in Black & White. A pair of hands open the lock box and take out the key to the Men of Letters bunker. Two men, one young and one older walk down the stairs. Both men have briefcases handcuffed to their right wrist. Each man sits at a different desk. They unlock the handcuffs and open the cases taking out some sort of old fashioned light bulbs. They plug them to two different boards and they light up. Both men stand and walk toward each other with smiles.]


OLDER MAN

Protocol's complete. James Haggerty.


YOUNGER MAN

Peter Jenkins.


[They shake hands]


PETER JENKINS [starting to look concerned]

Did we do everything right? Shouldn't...


[All the lights suddenly turn on and there is a wide shot of the whole bunker]


JAMES HAGGERTY [looking around in a non-impressed manner]

Took three years to build this dump?


PETER JENKINS [shocked]

Dump? Dump? Are you kidding? Do you realize where we are? This -- this dump is the last true beacon of light in a world gone topsy-turvy. This dump is the epicenter of -- of the ultimate chess match between good and evil.


[Scene switches to a close up of a chess board with the tagline SIX MONTHS LATER. The camera pulls back to reveal JENKINS and HAGGERTY playing chess in the bunker.]


PETER JENKINS

What a dump.

You know, when I got this assignment, I thought there'd be, I don't know, excitement, adventure.


JAMES HAGGERTY [nods in understanding]

There's nothing worse than adventure, my boy. Trust me.


[The phone rings and HAGGERTY answers.]


Extension 765.

[pause]

Yes.

No.

That's not the password.

[shakes his head]

There's protocol here, young lady.

We'll be waiting.


[hangs up the phone]

We have a guest -- damn hunter.

Frank's kid.


PETER JENKINS

Really?

Wow. What he did for her -- t-that was really something.


JAMES HAGGERTY

He was something, all right.


[They hear the sound of the front door opening above them and get up to greet the newcomer. A young woman hauls a large (struggling) bag towards them.]


PETER JENKINS

Holy buckets. It's really you.


YOUNG WOMAN

That's right, rookie. It's really me -- Dorothy.

Now, which one of you geniuses is gonna help me kill the wicked witch?


TITLE CARD

ACT ONE
[Camera opens on CROWLEY sitting in the dungeon. His eyes are closed until he hears the sound of the shelved being moved. He looks up, blinking in the sudden light to see SAM coming toward him.]


CROWLEY

Hello, Moose.


[SAM sets a piece of paper and a black crayon on the table in front of CROWLEY]


CROWLEY

You want more demon names.

[He crumples up the piece of paper]

I want a room with a view.


[SAM just smirks and turns around to leave. CROWLEY calls after him]


We can discuss this!

I'd settle for stretching my legs!


[SAM turns off the lights and shuts the door behind him.


CROWLEY [in the dark]

Bollocks.


[Scene switches to SAM working on the map table as DEAN walks in through the door upstairs.]


SAM

Hey. How'd it go with Kevin?


DEAN

Oh, that little nerd is in a lovely warded hotel room in Branson. He's got about 48 hours of pay-per-porn

and Kenny Rogers ahead of him.


SAM

How's he feeling?


DEAN [walking down the stairs]

Well, he stared at the Angel tablet and repeated the word "falafel" for the entire ride.

Kid's cracked. I'm hoping this break will, uh, clear his head.


You know, after everything that happened, I figured we could use a little break ourselves,

[DEAN opens a plastic sack]

so I, uh, picked you up season one "Game of Thrones." Figured we'd get a little takeout.


SAM

All right. Well, first, I think I might have found a way to help Cas.


[DEAN looks up suddenly concerned]

Did you talk to him?


SAM

No.

And, by the way, I still don't understand why he left in the first place. I mean, the bunker is the safest place for him. Bartholomew and -- and who knows how many other angels are out there, gunning for them.


DEAN

Hey, look, nobody wants him here more than I do, okay? But, uh, he felt like he'd bring trouble down on us, so he had to split.

But if you got a way to help him, I'm all ears.


SAM

All right. So, Kevin said the table lit up like a Christmas tree when the angels fell, right?


DEAN

So?


SAM

So it turns out each light was where a cluster of angels fell. So I'm thinking maybe there's some way to hot-wire this, make it track angels. That way, we could help Cas steer clear of danger.


DEAN

This was...your idea?


SAM [looks around slightly amused]

Do you see anybody else in here?


DEAN

So, how would it work?


SAM

Oh, no idea. See, at first, I thought the table was the computer, but it's not. It turns out it's just part of it.

But I did find these cables underneath, and I followed them. You're never gonna believe what I found.


[Scene changes to a room full of electrical panels, shelves and a very large, old computer. SAM and DEAN enter.]


SAM

Voil√†.


DEAN

This is a computer?


SAM

Yeah -- or it was in 1951, when it was installed. Now, here's the crazy thing. It's not plugged in to anything. I mean, I have no idea what's making this thing work.


[The boys walk around to the other side of the computer. Dean puts his hands on the back of it.]


DEAN

It's warm here.

[He looks around and finds a flat screwdriver on the shelf behind him. He inserts in under the back panel of the computer and starts to jimmy it open. He gives a giant pull and the panel pops off and sends DEAN stumbling back into the shelf behind him unknowingly knocking over a bottle with gray liquid in it.]


DEAN

Got it.


SAM [looking at the back of the computers full of wires and unknown parts.]

Huh.


DEAN [sarcasticly]

Well, that looks simple. Does it come with a manual?


SAM

Nothing in the archives, and I obviously couldn't find anything like it online, not to mention I'm pretty sure that the Men of Letters doesn't exactly have I.T. support anymore, either.


[While the boys are talking, behind them the gray liquid in the bottle starts to grow and move.]


DEAN

I think I know somebody who could help us. Come on.


[The Winchesters stand up and leave the room, switching off the light. The bottle's lid pops off and the gray liquid spills on the floor and then starts to grow and climb on the wall.]


[Scene switches back to the bunker in the 1930's. It is in black & white. JENKINS, HAGGERTY and DOROTHY are sitting at the table looking at the WICKED WITCH.]


JENKINS

So, what do you have to say for yourself?


DOROTHY

Nothing. I cut out her tongue. I've bound her, but it won't last.


HAGGERTY

Wait. You captured her all by yourself?


DOROTHY

Yes. Despite all my lady parts, I managed to capture the wicked witch.


JENKINS

Your father would be very proud. I mean, did you know that he --


DOROTHY [interrupting]

Wasted my time with his words. And I'd appreciate it if you didn't do the same.

Now, I have tried cutting off her head, burning her, dousing her with holy water. All she did was laugh.

Nothing I know of can kill her. So I'm here as a last resort. I was hoping you stiffs have a way to kill someone from Oz.


[As they talk, the WICKED WITCH is working on cutting the rope binding her hands behind her with a long fingernail.]


JENKINS

Well, of course we do. W-we have to. This place is the last true beacon of light!


DOROTHY

All right. Just open your damn books already.


HAGGERTY

All right, Jenkins. Let's go to work.


[The men leave the table and leave DOROTHY sitting there. The camera shot seamlessly transitions to color and DOROTHY fades and DEAN appears sitting at the far table. The front door above him opens and SAM and CHARLIE BRADBURY enter and walk down the stairs]


SAM

Here it is.


DEAN [smiling at CHARLIE as she waves at him.]

Hey. Thanks for coming.

[DEAN and CHARLIE hug]


CHARLIE

Not a problem, especially since I got fired last week.


SAM [setting her bag on the table]

Hey, what? What happened?


CHARLIE

Turns out the company I work for was outsourcing to child labor, so I took a big Wikileak all over that.

And, yeah. It's cool, though. It's given me more time to focus on my hobbies...

...like larping, macrame, and hunting.


DEAN [looks alarmed as SAM also looks concerned]

Excuse me?


CHARLIE

Okay. It was just a couple little cases. I took down a teenage vampire and a ghost...

...which sounds like a Y.A. novel if you say it out loud.


SAM [still concerned]

Charlie, how'd it go?


CHARLIE

It was, uh... It was intense. But I kind of wish hunting was more...magical, you know?


[DEAN rolls his eyes and SAM looks confused]


CHARLIE

Never mind.

So, where is this Commodore 64 of yours?


[They are back in the computer room and CHARLIE is geeking out over the old computer.]


CHARLIE

Sweet Ada Lovelace. This thing belongs in a museum. I mean, it's got encryption software. It seems to be powered by something magical.


DEAN

Skip to the end.


CHARLIE

It's kind of an alarm system. Global badness? It freaks. This computer is what locked this place down.


SAM

Can we use it to track angels?


CHARLIE

All right. Let me see what I can do.


[A while later, CHARLIE has hooked up all kinds of wires and switches to her computer. She plugs the last on in.]


CHARLIE

All right. It took some doing, but now we can download. This beast has all the Men of Letters files. Time for a little drag-and-drop.


SAM

Wow. Well, it's a start. Thank you. Um, that's -- that's great.


[DEAN signals to SAM to ask CHARLIE something]


SAM

So, you've been hunting.


DEAN

Alone.


CHARLIE

I know. Not a good idea, according to the "Supernatural" books.


[Both boys look annoyed]


SAM

You really can't delete those from the Internet?


CHARLIE

Not even I can do that. Come on!


DEAN

Where do you even find them?


CHARLIE [with a cheeky grin]

A top-secret place I call Amazon. And someone uploaded all the unpublished works. I thought

it was fanfic at first, but it was clearly Edlund's work.


SAM

Who uploaded it?


CHARLIE

I don't know. Their screen name was beckywinchester176. Ring a bell?


[DEAN looks sharply at SAM and he gets very flustered]


SAM

None.

Uh, nobody's.

Uh, no, there are no bells.

Uh...No.


[CHARLIE looks at SAM likes he's lost his mind and then looks back to her computer.]

Ugh, these files are encrypted. This is gonna take a while.

So, takeout, sleepover, braid each other's hair?


SAM

Got an idea.


[Scene switches to Sam's room which is covered in files and books. DEAN and CHARLIE are sitting on his bed and SAM sits on a chair beside them. They are watching Game of Thrones. The episode ends and DEAN turns off the TV.]


DEAN

Wow. That Joffrey's a dick.


CHARLIE

Oh, you have no idea. Wait until he --


SAM

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! S-spoilers. I haven't read all the books yet.


DEAN

You're gonna read the books?


SAM

Yes, Dean. I like to read books -- you know, the ones without pictures.


[DEAN shoots an annoyed look at his brother.]


CHARLIE

Man, this bed is about as comfortable as a brick. Any plans on moving in anytime soon?


SAM

I am moved in. This is just my style.


DEAN

Yeah, this is his, uh, style.


SAM

Well, I'm sorry I haven't hung up the, uh, "Hang in there, kitty" poster yet, Dean. Feel free to redecorate.


DEAN

So, what, our home's not good enough for the "Hang in there, kitty" poster?


SAM

This isn't our home. This is where we work.


DEAN

What's the difference?


CHARLIE [looking uncomfortable with the sibling arguement]

Okay.


DEAN [gets up from the bed]

All right, well, I'm gonna go get us some more beers. How about that?


[After DEAN leaves the room. SAM looks to CHARLIE]


SAM

So, Charlie, what was all that about how hunting isn't magical?


CHARLIE

Saving people, hunting things, the family business? I am down.

But... I was raised on Tolkien, man. I mean, where is all this?

[She holds up the Game of Thrones disc]

Where are my White Walkers and my volcano and magic ring to throw in the damn thing?

Where -- where's my quest?


SAM

Magic, quests...suck. Trust me. They're all --


[Scene turns immediately to Black & White and the 1930's MOL group sitting in the bunker]


HAGGERTY

--dead ends

Nothing but dead ends.


JENKINS

There's got to be some way to kill this thing.


[The WICKED WITCH finally snaps the last of her bonds and jumps from the chair. JENKINS goes for her with a knife.]


HAGGERTY

Jenkins, no!


[The WICKED WITCH throws her hand to JENKINS head and his eyes flash bright green. He looks to fall under a trance.]


WICKED WITCH [talking through JENKINS]

There's something here that belongs to me. Take me to it.


HAGGERTY

What the hell's it talking about?


DOROTHY

I have no idea. Do you have a lab?


HAGGERTY

Second floor, room 28.


[DOROTHY runs out of the room and JENKINS tries to follow her. HAGGERTY grabs him and they fight. JENKINS gets the upper hand and pushes the knife toward HAGGERTY's chest.]


HAGGERTY

Wait! Jenkins, Jenkins! I know you're in there.


WICKED WITCH/JENKINS

Jenkins is gone.


[HAGGERTY does a move and stabs WICKED WITCH/JENKINS with his own knife. JENKINS eyes flash green again and he is out of the trance.]


HAGGERTY

Jenkins. Jenkins.


JENKINS [dying]

You were right. There's nothing worse than adventure.


[JENKINS dies and HAGGERTY runs to look for DOROTHY. He sees a bright flash of light behind a door and runs to open it. The door opens to DEAN, SAM and CHARLIE entering the computer room (the scene is back in color)]


CHARLIE

Download should be done by now.


DEAN [noticing one of the shelves has moved]

What the hell?

Sam, give me a hand.


[SAM and DEAN move the shelf away to reveal two gray pods on the wall. SAM pulls his gun as DEAN takes out a knife and cuts part of the way through one pod. A arm falls out. DEAN cuts the rest of the way and woman falls to the ground. DEAN draws his own gun before turning the woman over. We see that it is DOROTHY. SAM, DEAN and CHARLIE exchange confused glances.]

ACT TWO
[Scene opens with DEAN and CHARLIE reading the MOL case folder on DOROTHY.]


CHARLIE

Holy crap! The first case investigated in this bunker involved Dorothy. She and the witch came into this room, and they never came out. This will never stop blowing my mind!


DEAN

Okay, pace yourself, Toto.


CHARLIE

Oz is this real! It's part of the fairy world.


[We see DOROTHY sitting on the floor with a blanket around her shoulders. SAM squats beside her.]


DOROTHY

We have to find her.


SAM

No, we have to talk before anyone does anything, okay? Dorothy?


DOROTHY

Talk? Typical Men of Letters, standing around, having a nice, little chat with your noses buried in your books while your little secretary takes notes.


DEAN

We're hunters.


CHARLIE

And who are you calling a secretary?


DOROTHY

You're not a secretary? You're a Woman of Letters? W-- how long have I been out?


SAM

That's why we need to talk. Look, you've been gone for over 75 years. Now, according to our files, you came here to kill the wicked witch and then disappeared. What happened?


DOROTHY

We couldn't find a way to kill her, so I did the only thing that I could.


[Scene changes to Black & White and we see DOROTHY in the computer room mixing a spell into the glass bottle. The WICKED WITCH appears.]


DOROTHY

It's you and me forever, bitch.


[DOROTHY caps the bottle and they both disappear in a flash of light. HAGGERTY flings the door open to find nobody.]


HAGGERTY

Dorothy! Dorothy!


[back to the scene in the computer room. Present day.]


DOROTHY

A binding spell that came at a price -- her soul with mine.


SAM

So you've been frozen with the witch for all this time?


DOROTHY

Yes. Look, the witch cannot be killed. If I am awake, then so is she.


[Scene changes to the WICKED WITCH entering the dungeon.]


CROWLEY

Hello, lovely.


[The WICKED WITCH tries to cross the Devil's Trap and it burns her feet.]


CROWLEY

Sorry. This litter box is warded against everything, even wicked witches.

Big fan. Love your work.


[The WICKED WITCH hisses and her eyes glow green.]


What's the matter, darling? Cowardly lion got your tongue? Right. Enough chitchat. Must be here for a reason.


[CROWLEY wraps his crayon and paper together and throws it at her. She catches it.]


Write it down so daddy can help.


[Back to the computer room.]


SAM

Wait, if she's here, why didn't she kill you?


DOROTHY

She can't.


CHARLIE

You're protected by the Witch of the North's kiss. It's from the books.


DOROTHY

Oh, forget the books! They're not important. I'm protected. You aren't. Now, the witch came here looking for something. I have no idea what it is. But we have to find her before she finds it.


DEAN

All right, all right. Charlie, dig into the files. See if you can find anything that puts a dent in a witch.


CHARLIE

Mm-hmm.


DEAN

Sam and I will have a look-see. Come on.


DOROTHY

I'm helping.


SAM

Yeah, I don't doubt it. But for right now, why don't you rest up and help the smartest person in the room?


[The boys leave.]


CHARLIE

So big fan.


DOROTHY

Hmm.


CHARLIE

Ozma of Oz --


DOROTHY

Is a total ass.


CHARLIE [looks dejected]

You were much nicer in the books.


DOROTHY

Those books are the ravings of a sad, old man -- my father.


CHARLIE

Wait. Your dad was L. Frank Baum, the writer?


DOROTHY

A Man of Letters. Another glorified librarian, you ask me.


CHARLIE

Hey, these guys may have been sexist, but like all librarians, they were wicked smart, too. The dude who was here when you came in -- Haggerty -- he kept your case file open, worked it every day until he retired. Obviously, he never found you, but if you took five seconds to read, he did find way to fight the Wicked Witch.

Do you remember the poppy fields in the first book?


DOROTHY

That's not actually how it happened. It was much bloodier.


CHARLIE

Stop... ruining my childhood.

Do you remember the poppies?

[DOROTHY nods]

Good. Haggerty made a deal with a fairy and got some poppy extract. I'm gonna get some bullets from the gun range and make us some poppy bullets. So, are you coming or what?


[Scene changes to the brothers clearing the bunker with guns pulled. CROWLEY starts whistling 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'.]


CROWLEY

Wow. If it isn't the Scarecrow and the Tin Man. Your new houseguest -- so misunderstood.

[the boys look confused]

Neither of you saw "wicked"?


SAM

What did she say to you?


CROWLEY

Something along the lines of... [CROWLEY hisses loudly]


DEAN

All right, well, I'm gonna go get some holy oil and a lighter, dick bag.


CROWLEY

I know what she's looking for.


SAM

What does she want?


CROWLEY

I'd be happy to tell you, as soon as I get to stretch my legs.


[DEAN unlocks the neck cuff while SAM holds a gun on him and CROWLEY stands.]


CROWLEY

Oh. Ahh.


SAM

All right. What does the witch want?


CROWLEY

Give me a moment. I still need to air myself out.


[DEAN pulls his guns and shoots CROWLEY square in the chest.]


DEAN

I think you're aired out enough.


CROWLEY

Rude.


[He holds up the piece of paper with the word "KEY" written on it]


SAM

Key? What key?


CROWLEY

I haven't the foggiest. Had to send her off on a merry chase before she could melt me. Told her you boys kept the keys in the kitchen. You do have a kitchen in this crap hole, don't you?


[Camera pans across the bunker's kitchen which is a complete wreak. The boys enter with guns drawn.]


DEAN

Damn it, I just cleaned in here.


SAM

Really?


DEAN

Looks like we got a witch here.


[CHARLIE and DOROTHY enter and the boys swing around guns drawn. When they see its the girls they put them away.]


CHARLIE

Sorry. We raided your gun range. Made us some poppy bullets. They won't kill the witch, but they will stun the crap out of her.


DEAN [with a proud look]

That's my girl.


CHARLIE

There was only enough for four bullets, so...make each shot count.


DOROTHY

Now we just have to find her before she finds whatever the hell's she's looking for.


SAM

She's looking for a key.


CHARLIE

How do you know?


SAM

Little birdie told us. Ring any bells, Dorothy?


DOROTHY

Unfortunately. It's the key to Oz. There are magical ways into Oz -- tornado, eye of a hurricane, whirlpool -- but this key will turn any locked door into a portal to Oz. Insert key, twist, and presto, you're in Oz.


SAM

How did the Men of Letters get the key?


DOROTHY

I have no idea, but if she finds it, she'll go back and finish what she started. She'll destroy all that is good in Oz. She's got armies of witches, flying monkeys. Many will die.


DEAN

What's this key look like?


[DOROTHY pulls out her journal and shows DEAN a picture]


DEAN

I've seen that key. Found it when I was doing inventory.


DOROTHY

Where is it now?


DEAN

My room. We got to get to that key. All right, Charlie and I will go look in my room. Why don't you guys buy us some time?


[SAM and DOROTHY leave]


DEAN

Charlie? Safest place in this joint is the dungeon.


CHARLIE

You have a dungeon in this place? Of course you do.


DEAN

So maybe you should...


CHARLIE

I am not hiding, especially in a dungeon. Wicked Witch, a key, a quest? Let's do this.

[She bounces away out the door]


DEAN

C-Charlie...


[DOROTHY and SAM walk through the main part of the bunker.]


DOROTHY

I can't believe I've lived here for 75 years. How long have you called this place home?


SAM

My brother calls it home. Me, I, uh -- I haven't had that much luck with homes.


DOROTHY

Me neither. Overrated, you ask me. Yellow bricks or not, give me the open road any day.

[She turns to see the WICKED WITCH behind SAM]

Sam!


[DOROTHY shoots a poppy bullet at the WICKED WITCH but misses and she disappears into a vent]


DOROTHY

She can get anywhere from there. Split up, cover more ground?


[CHARLIE and DEAN are searching through DEAN's room. CHARLIE opens a box full of antique porn.]


CHARLIE

You keep your porn meticulously organized, but not --


DEAN

Don't judge me.

Ah! [pulls the key out of a box]

Yahtzee.


[CHARLIE turns around to see and sees the WICKED WITCH behind DEAN.]


CHARLIE

Dean!


[The WICKED WITCH grabs the key from DEAN's hand and slaps him into the wall; stunning him. She then prepares to throw green lightning at him.]


CHARLIE [throwing herself between DEAN and the green lightning bolt. She catches it all square in the chest.]

No!


[CHARLIE falls the ground unconscious. DEAN stands up and shoot the WICKED WITCH with a poppy bullet and she disappears in a vent again.]


DEAN

Charlie? Charlie?

[He bends down and shakes her. No response]

Charlie?!

[He starts to tear up as he cradles he head in his hand]

Charlie.


ACT THREE
[DEAN carries CHARLIE to his bed and lays he down.]

Charlie?

[He wipes the hair out of her face]

Charlie?

[He starts to panic]

No!


SAM [from the hallway]

Dean!


[DEAN whips around]

Zeke!

[SAM enters the doorway but immediately his eyes flash blue and EZEKIEL is there.]

You have to help her.


EZEKIEL

She's gone.


DEAN

No. You can bring her back like you did with Cas.


EZEKIEL

I cannot keep doing that.


DEAN

Why the hell not?!


EZEKIEL

I am barely back to half-strength, Dean. Every time I use my power, it weakens me, which means I will have to stay in your brother longer than you want -- longer than we both want. The witch running around your bunker is very powerful. I can help with the witch or save your friend.


DEAN

Save her.


EZEKIEL

As you wish.


[He approaches CHARLIE and lays two fingers on her forehead. She gasps and sits up as EZEKIEL falls to the ground unconscious]


CHARLIE

Merry Christmas.


DEAN

Charlie?


CHARLIE

Uh. Hey, I know you.


DEAN

I told you to stay in the dungeon.


CHARLIE

Bet you say that to all the girls.


SAM jolts awake

Dean?


DEAN

Sammy?


SAM

What the hell just happened?


DEAN

The witch -- the witch was about to put a whammy on me, and, uh, Charlie jumped in front. She got zapped, then the witch got the drop on you.


SAM

Then why aren't we dead?


DEAN

That's a good question. I, uh -- I clipped her with a -- with a poppy bullet. She got the key. I think she's gone.


DOROTHY enters

No. She's wounded. We should still have some time. She could still be in the air vents.


CHARLIE tries to get up from the bed but is still woozy.

No. No, no. She's right. We -- we have to -- we --


DEAN steadies her

Whoa, whoa, whoa.


DOROTHY

Just go. We'll catch up.


CHARLIE gestures to SAM

M-my gun's over there. There's one bullet in it.


[SAM grabs the gun and the brothers leave.]


CHARLIE to DOROTHY

Can we be best friends now?


[The boys are in the hallway looking for the WICKED WITCH]


SAM

Who's Zeke?


DEAN

What?


SAM

When I came into your room, before I got zapped, I thought you said the name Zeke. Who's that?


DEAN

Um... I think you're still a little punchy, man.

Just keep moving.


[Back in DEAN's room with CHARLIE and DOROTHY]


CHARLIE

I had the weirdest dream when I was out. It was Christmas, and my parents were still alive, and --


DOROTHY

Dream? Charlie, you died. Don't worry about it, though. You're not a real hunter until you've died and come back again.


CHARLIE

Slow down. Why would you think I died?


DOROTHY

Heaven -- it's your dream life. And if you were zapped by the Wicked Witch Instant death. I would know.

She killed me, too.


CHARLIE

Okay. Let's rewind here a bit. When did you die?


DOROTHY

In Oz. My father was obsessed with his work as a Man of Letters, and then I was born... and nothing changed. He would keep his work a secret, but I was such a curious kid. I was always looking for trouble,

looking for the next big adventure.


CHARLIE

I know the feeling.


DOROTHY

I stowed away on one of his cases, wound up in the emerald city, accidentally got left behind. It was terrifying.


CHARLIE

Well, what happened?


DOROTHY

I met up with these three freedom fighters, and they thought I was this child of destiny chosen to kill

the Wicked Witch. They protected me, and then the witch turned them into --


CHARLIE

A scarecrow, a tin man, and a lion?


DOROTHY

And then she hunted me down and killed me.


CHARLIE

Yeah, that never made it to the books.


DOROTHY

Sometimes real life is darker than fiction.


[Back to the boys combing the main room]


DEAN

Why haven't you moved in?


SAM

Is now really the time for this, Dean?


DEAN

Well, just asking.


SAM

Look, I never had what you had with mom and dad, okay?


DEAN

What are you talking about?


SAM

I don't have any memories of home. And whenever I've tried to make a home of my own, it really hasn't ended well.


DEAN

Yeah, but a lifetime of abandoned buildings and crappy motel rooms. I mean, this is about as close

to home as we're gonna get, and it's ours.


[Back to DOROTHY and CHARLIE leaving DEAN's room]


CHARLIE

And what about the books?


DOROTHY

Revisionist history. That's my father's way of trying to undo what had happened to me. But I knew the truth. When the witch came to our world, I became a hunter, and my father wrote those silly books.


CHARLIE

Don't you get it? The books aren't silly. They're guidebooks filled with clues he left for you. Haggerty

pored through each one, and his research led him to uncover the poppies, so maybe there's something else from the books we can use, preferably something with a pointy end.


DOROTHY lights up as something dawns on her

You are a genius. Come on. We've got to get to the garage.


CHARLIE

There's a garage in this place?! Oh, boy.


[Back to the boys in the main room]


SAM

Clear.


DEAN

I got nothing.


SAM

What do you think? Is she gone?


DEAN turns around to see the WICKED WITCH grab SAM and almost shoot green lightning at him

Sam!


[DEAN rushes them and knocks all three of them over the table. Before they can recover the WICKED WITCH places her hands on their foreheads and their eyes flash green.]


WICKED WITCH/SAM

Find the girls...


WICKED WITCH/DEAN

And kill them both.


[The scene changes to a huge beautiful garage with the girls entering.]


DOROTHY looks around and spots a motorcyle

Yes. I knew those boy scouts would keep it for me.


[The girls rush over to the bike and DOROTHY starts to take items out of the saddle bag. She holds up a mask]


CHARLIE

Is that...?


DOROTHY

Yeah.

He didn't make it.


CHARLIE

Ooh.


DOROTHY keeps digging

Please be here. Please be here.

Yes!

[She pulls out a pair of ruby high heels]


CHARLIE

I don't believe it.

Did you really walk down a brick road in these?


DOROTHY

No. I never actually wore them. Seemed kind of tacky wearing a dead woman's shoes.

Plus, I'm no good in heels, you know?


CHARLIE

I don't suppose we could just wish her away?


DOROTHY

Sorry. Another thing the books got wrong. But, like the poppies, these have magic from Oz -- sharp magic.


CHARLIE

Oh. Death by shoe?


WICKED WITCH/DEAN

There you are.


CHARLIE turns around to see the brothers and asks with a grin

Was that your Batman voice?


[The boys eyes flash green]


CHARLIE

That's definitely not your Batman voice.


DOROTHY

It's her. She possessed the both of them.


WICKED WITCH/SAM

I missed you, my pretty.


WICKED WITCH/DEAN

Killing you a second time will be just as sweet as the first.


CHARLIE

Guys, I know you're in there. Dean, you can't let the witch do this. If she opens the door, she's going to destroy Oz.

[WICKED WITCH/DEAN grabs CHARLIE by the shoulders and smashes her into a glass window.]


[Scene changes to the WICKED WITCH climbing the stairs in the main room carrying a handful of ingredients for a spell. She sets it down in front of a door.


WICKED WITCH/DEAN

I have no intention of escaping to Oz. I'm going to bring my armies here.


[The WICKED WITCH mixes the spell and then inserts the key into the door's lock and pushes it open. She looks into Oz and we see a black castle with rolling red clouds in the sky. The WICKED WITCH lets out a cackling scream.]


ACT FOUR
WICKED WITCH/DEAN

Don't worry. You'll join Dorothy

right after you watch her die.


CHARLIE

Sorry about the nards, Dean.


[She kicks him between the legs and he doubles over in pain]


DOROTHY throws the ruby high heels at CHARLIE

Go. I'll buy you some time.

[CHARLIE leaves and DOROTHY turns to face the possessed brothers.]

All right.

Let's see what you pencil necks are made of.


[The WICKED WITCH is calling her flying monkeys through the door. They spill out of the black castle.]


DOROTHY [all beat up and bloody]

All right, let's do this the old-fashioned way.


WICKED WITCH/SAM

My body cannot hurt you, Dorothy.


WICKED WITCH/DEAN

But theirs can.


[WICKED WITCH/SAM grabs DOROTHY and WICKED WITCH/DEAN holds the demon knife to her throat.]


[The WICKED WITCH suddenly goes stiff and she turns as her eyes flash green. We see CHARLIE behind her and a ruby high heel is stuck in the back of the WICKED WITCH's head.]


CHARLIE

Now heel!

[CHARLIE stabs the other slipper into the WITCH's head]


[Back in the garage, the Winchester's eyes flash green and the spell is broken.]


SAM

What the hell just happened?


DOROTHY

Charlie.


[CHARLIE is struggling to close the door before the flying monkeys get there. She barely makes it in time and then opens the door to make sure. It is just a empty bunker hallway now. Searching the WITCH's cloak, she finds and takes the key to Oz. CHARLIE hears the others making their way back into the room. CHARLIE smiles down at them and waves the key She hears the other making their way back into the room. CHARLIE smiles down at them.]

CHARLIE

Ding-dong, bitches.

ACT FIVE
[SAM puts CROWLEY back in neck cuffs. He also sets a new piece of paper and the crayon back on the table and turns to leave the room.]


CROWLEY

Aah!

Really, after all I did with Ms. defying gravity?

[the lights go out as the door closes behind SAM]

Bollocks.


[SAM, DEAN, CHARLIE and DOROTHY are all in the bunker's garage. The Impala is also there.]


DEAN

Baby looks good in here, huh?


SAM grins

Not bad.


CHARLIE [motions him to the side]

Dean...


SAM

Dorothy, I, uh -- I found something in the archives. Pretty sure it belongs to you.

[SAM hands DOROTHY a copy of "The Wonderful World of Oz"]


DOROTHY smiles

You have no idea how odd it is having a series of books written about you.


SAM

Actually, I-I do know, uh, and it is definitely weird. But you know what? End of the day, it's our story, so we get to write it.


[to DEAN and CHARLIE]

CHARLIE

So, thanks for the slumber party...


DEAN

Mm.


CHARLIE lowers her voice

...and bringing me back from the dead.


DEAN

Uh, I didn't.


CHARLIE

Don't B.S. a B.S.er.

Am I a zombie now? Do I need to eat brains?


DEAN

No, no, no. You're you. You're gonna be fine, all right? Just, um -- just keep this between us, okay?


CHARLIE

All right, but only 'cause you raised me from the dead, which you're going to have to explain to me later.


DEAN

All right.

[They rejoin SAM and DOROTHY]


DOROTHY

Not bad for a bunch of librarians. You mind keeping an eye on my bike for me?


DEAN

Yeah, yeah, as long as you don't mind me taking it for a spin once in a while.


DOROTHY

Deal.

Thank you for everything. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a rebellion to finish.

[she turns to CHARLIE]

So, you coming or what?


CHARLIE

What? With you? To Oz?


DOROTHY

Yeah. You said you were looking for adventure. Well, here it is, Red. Come help me find my damn dog.


DEAN looking concerned

You have no idea what's in Oz. I mean, t-there's flying monkeys, armies of witches. There's all kinds of danger.


CHARLIE lights up

Promise?


[She jumps to hug DEAN and then hugs SAM]


SAM

If you need anything, just, uh, tap your heels together three times, okay?


CHARLIE

Me? What about you crazy kids? You gonna be all right without me? Take care of yourselves, boys.


[DOROTHY and CHARLIE turn and insert the key into the double doors at the end of the garage. They push it open to reveal a beautiful landscape with a yellow-brick road running through it. In the distance you can see the Emerald City. They walk into Oz and turn to wave goodbye. The doors close behind them. DEAN and SAM push the doors back open but now it is just the underground tunnel leading out of the garage.]


DEAN wistfully

Think she'll be back?


SAM

Of course. There's no place like home.
