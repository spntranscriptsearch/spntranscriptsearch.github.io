NOW
(Menomonie, Wisconsin)
MADDIE
Here you go. One spoonful of sugar or two?
MS. BERMAN
Maddie, daddy and I are ready to go to dinner now. So whenever you’re ready, you just let us know.
MADDIE
Sparkle and me aren’t done with tea, mommy.
MS. BERMAN
Well... When you’re ready.
MADDIE’S DAD
We have reservations.
MS. BERMAN
The RIE Manual says be patient.
MADDIE’S DAD
So now we wait for her to have fake tea with her fake imaginary friend? Perfect.
MADDIE
We can party forever, while mommy and daddy eat Cheerios for dinner!
SPARKLE
It’s cool, Maddie. Go with your mom and dad. I’ll clean up.
MADDIE
I love you, Sparkle.
(Later, Sparkle is alone in Maddie’s room, reading The Velveteen Rabbit. The door opens.)
SPARKLE
Hiya, Maddie! – You’re not Madd... (Sparkle is stabbed.)
(In the hallway.)
MS. BERMAN
Don’t forget to brush your teeth, sweetie.
(Maddie opens the door to her room.)
MADDIE
Sparkle!
(Maddie screams.)
TITLE CARD: SUPERNATURAL
(Sam’s phone buzzes. The screen shows an alarm set for 6:30 AM. Sam gets out of bed and goes to the kitchen, followed by an unnoticed shadowy figure. Sam also doesn’t notice the buffet of childish treats set out on the kitchen table – until he does.)
SULLY
Surprise!
(Sam, surprised, punches Sully.)
SAM (holding Sully by the collar)
Who are you??
SULLY
It’s me, Sam! It’s Sully!
SAM
What?
SULLY
You remember me, right? I made all your favorite snacks. We’re friends. Like best friends. You remember?
SAM
Sully.
SULLY
Yeah.
SAM
No. You’re not real.
SULLY
Well, how’d you punch me, then?
(Dean walks into the kitchen and sees Sam holding onto empty air with a threatening stance.)
SAM
This can’t be happening.
DEAN
Dude. Who you talking to?
SAM
Him?
DEAN
Are you having a stroke? Do you smell toast?
SULLY
He can’t see me unless I want him to.
DEAN
What is all of this crap? When did you start eating this stuff? Is that marshmallows on nachos?
SAM
Yeah, this wasn’t me.
SULLY (appearing to Dean)
It was me. And those are delicious.
SAM
Wait a second. Can you see him?
DEAN
Uh-huh.
SAM
Dean, this is, um... I think this is... Sully, my friend from when I was a kid.
DEAN
You mean Mork from Ork here is your dumbass imaginary friend Sully?
SAM
Yeah.
SULLY
Um, I’m not dumb or ass.
DEAN
I’m gonna get my gun.
SULLY
No, please... Someone killed my friend.
DEAN
You mean your imaginary imaginary friend?
SULLY
First off, “imaginary friend” is more of a descriptive term. How you just said it? That was a little... offensive, just to be honest. Secondly, we’re Zanna. Me and... me and the victim, we’re Zanna. We help kids. We’re the good guys. Sam, tell him.
SAM
Yeah, okay. Um... You know what, I’m still trying to wrap my head around this whole you being real thing.
SULLY
Aww! Yeah, no no, of course. No, that’s okay, that’s okay. This is all really unexpected.
DEAN
Yeah, that’s one word for it.
SULLY
Just... I need your help. You’re hunters, that’s what you do, right? I mean, you help people too.
DEAN
Yeah, yeah. People. You are not that.
SAM
Dean, come on.
DEAN
Come on?? Are you kiddi... Look... This... mother... You and me, library, right now. Come on!
(Sam and Dean leave the kitchen. Sully makes to follow.)
DEAN (turning to stop Sully)
AH!
SULLY (startled)
Aah! Yeah, no, I’ll just stay here. Coolio.
(Sam and Dean walk into the library.)
DEAN
You’re not actually buying this crap, are you?
SAM
Dean, when I was nine years old, you know what I wanted more than anything? Marshmallow nachos.
DEAN
Yeah, you were a weird-ass kid.
SAM
Yeah, well, the only person I ever told about it...
DEAN
Sully.
SAM
Yes.
DEAN
I don’t know, man. I... Hey, you know, maybe this is just one of your visions. 

SAM
Yeah, except we’re both seeing it. And it doesn’t involve the Cage or Lucifer, or me having to talk to Lucifer in the Cage. Look at this. Here.
(Sam shows Dean a page in a book.)
SAM
In Romanian lore, Zanna are creatures who guide and protect lost children. Zanna intentionally appear as figments of a child’s imagination, allowing the child to move on with confidence once guidance is no longer necessary. Maybe Sully’s telling the truth.
DEAN
Okay. Say Bozo is legit. Right? Which, you know – hello crazytown, but okay. How is this our problem?
SAM
Because someone’s dead.
DEAN
No, someTHING is dead. A fairy godmother getting capped? That ain’t our beat.
SAM
Yes, I know that, Dean, but...
DEAN
But what?
SAM
But as messed up and insane as this sounds, Sully helped me.
(Exterior, day. The Impala stops in front of the Berman house.)
SULLY (in the back seat)
That’s the place. It’s a horror show in there.
SAM
You mean you’ve been inside?
SULLY
Last night. I’m in management now, so I don’t get out in the field much. I just came to see Sparkle.
DEAN
Sp... Sparkle?
SULLY
Yeah. I show up and, I mean the place was bananas. Kid had called the cops, mom’s freaking out, and... Sparkle... Sam, it was horrible.
DEAN
Okay, so according to Zanna rules, the kid is the only witness, right?
SULLY
Yeah. Poor thing. I’ll meet you inside.
(Sully vanishes.)
DEAN
All right, what are you thinking?
(Later, still day, in front of the Berman house. Dean and Sam get out the Impala, wearing button-ups, ties and knit sweaters.)
DEAN
Good. The Bert and Ernie pretext. Awesome.
SAM
Dude, you didn’t have to come.
DEAN
You know, this whole imaginary friend thing was dumb then and it’s dumb now.
SAM
Yeah, you’ve made that pretty clear.
DEAN
You didn’t think to tell me he was real?
SAM
Well, Dean, I didn’t think he WAS. You saw the lore book too, I mean, maybe when I was nine years old I thought he was real, but I grew up. Or grew out of it. Whatever. I left it.
DEAN
And what did you need Drop Dead Fred for in the first place?
SAM
I was kind of a lonely kid, Dean.
DEAN
You weren’t lonely. You had me!
(Sam remembers...)
(Motel room interior, day. A wall-mounted phone rings. Nine year old Sam looks at it.)
SULLY
Go on, bud. Whatever happens, it’s cool beans.
YOUNG SAM (picks up the phone)
Dean?
YOUNG DEAN (on the phone)
Hey.
YOUNG SAM
Did you ask?
YOUNG DEAN
Yeah, it’s not gonna happen.
YOUNG SAM
Come on. You said.
YOUNG DEAN
Look, I said I would ask. Dad said no, what do you want me to do about it?
YOUNG SAM
But I’ve been shooting. I can run two miles. I know silver kills werewolves, and...
YOUNG DEAN
Sammy.
YOUNG SAM
No fair. You started hunting when you were younger than me.
YOUNG DEAN
Yeah, well, I never had an imaginary friend.
SULLY
I heard that.
YOUNG DEAN
Look, I’ll keep working on dad, all right?
SULLY
Don’t listen to him, Sammy. He’s a germ.
YOUNG DEAN
Now, maybe you can come next time.
YOUNG SAM
Sure.
YOUNG DEAN
All right, I gotta go. Call you in a couple of days.
YOUNG SAM
Yeah. I’ll just be...
(Young Dean hangs up.)
YOUNG SAM
... here.
SULLY
Hey, come on. We can finally make those bottle rockets. Right?
(Back in the present, Sam and Dean ring the doorbell. Ms. Berman opens the door.)
MS. BERMAN
Can I help you?
SAM
Ms. Berman, I’m Dr. Strummer. This is my associate.
DEAN
Dr. MacGowan.
SAM
We are trauma counselors with child services. We’re here to follow up on a police report filed yesterday?
MS. BERMAN
Oh, that was... Come in. My daughter Maddie, she’s the one who called. Uh, she has an active imagination. She made up this unicorn man, Sparkle. But, um, she thinks he’s dead. In her room.
DEAN
So, Sparkle is a unicorn and also a man?
MS. BERMAN
Yeah.
DEAN
So, a manicorn.
MS. BERMAN
I... I guess?
SAM
May we...?
MS. BERMAN
Yes, please. Thank you.
(Sam, Dean and Ms. Berman enter a room where Maddie is sitting.)
SAM
Hey, Maddie. My partner and I would like to ask you about last night. About Sparkle? Your mom says you don’t want to go back into your room? How come?
MADDIE
All the blood.
(New scene. Ms. Berman shows Sam and Dean into Maddie’s room.)
MS. BERMAN
This has been her room since she was a baby. She’s loved this room. And then, last night...
SAM
Do you mind if we take a look around?
MS. BERMAN
I’ll be right back.
(Ms. Berman leaves.)
DEAN
Allright, what’s the problem?
SULLY (suddenly appearing)
I told you it was horrible.
DEAN
You mind enlightening us?
SULLY
Oh.
(Sully carefully steps over to the brothers and raises his hands towards their foreheads.)
SULLY
If I show you all we can see, you can’t tell a soul.
DEAN
Yeah, cause chicks dig the whole imaginary friend thing. Fine.
(Sully touches their foreheads. When they look at the room this time, they see a severed manicorn horn and glittering blood everywhere.)
DEAN
Oh.
(Sparkle’s dead body is lying on a bean bag.)
DEAN
Oh yeah. That kid is gonna need all the shrinks.
SAM
Wait a second. So his... blood is glittery?
SULLY
Even when he’s dead, Sparkle can’t stop shining. Who would do this?
DEAN
It was a blade.
SAM
Sully, can Zanna see other Zanna?
SULLY
Of course. But it’s not what you’re thinking. A Zanna could never do this.
MS. BERMAN
Nothing to see, right? I was always under the impression that it was a parent’s job to let a child be a child as long as possible.
SULLY
Oh, this is bad.
MS. BERMAN
Maybe we let her get too carried away. I don’t know. I mean...
(Ms. Berman picks up a teddy bear soaked in blood.)
MS. BERMAN
An imaginary friend named Sparkle. What’s cuter than that?
(Ms. Berman puts her blood-soaked hand to her face and sighs.)
SULLY
Ugh!
MS. BERMAN
I’m sorry. I’m being as dramatic as my daughter now.
SULLY
Um, it’s on her face. Sam, it’s on her face!
MS. BERMAN
Just tell me...
SULLY
She’s got Sparkle on her face!
MS. BERMAN
... how do we get our girl back?
SULLY
Somebody’s gotta say something. Somone’s gotta say something.
SAM
You know what, is there a spare bedroom? Great. Maybe Maddie can sleep there, that should help.
SULLY
Not her face.
DEAN
And a hot shower. That does wonders.
SAM
Real deep scrub. Purify.
MS. BERMAN
For Maddie?
DEAN
The whole family. Yeah, just get the whole gang in there... You know, the family that showers together... Kay.
SULLY
Pull up. Pull up!
SAM
You know what, why don’t you start there? You can contact our office for more guidance if you like.
MS. BERMAN
Okay?
(New scene – exterior, day. Zoe is playing in a backyard pool.)
NICKY
Oh my gosh, Zoe, I think I saw the treasure too!
ZOE
Let’s go for it!
NICKY
But wait, don’t you have gymnastics?
ZOE
Oh yeah. Let’s look at it when I get back!
NICKY
Right on!
(Zoe leaves the pool, Nicky stays in the water. She’s a mermaid. Someone comes up behind Nicky and stabs her.)
(New scene: exterior, day. Dean, Sam and Sully get out of the Impala.)
SULLY
Nicky didn’t check in with the home office last night. This can’t be happening.
DEAN
You gazoos can talk to each other?
SULLY
Us Zanna share a telepathic link.
(Sam and Dean head for the front door of the house.)
SULLY
She wouldn’t be in there.
(Sully runs for the backyard. Sam and Dean follow. They discover Nicky dead in the pool.)
DEAN
A frickin’ mermaid?
SULLY
It’s a bloodbath.
DEAN
All right, just let it out.
SULLY
No, no. I gotta stay strong for Sam.
SAM
Looks like more stabbing.
DEAN
Okay, Sully, is there anybody that would want to hurt, uh, Nicky?
SULLY
No. Uh...
DEAN
What?
SULLY
Oh well, I mean, her boyfriend’s a little clingy. But he’s one of my best friends. Guys, Weems would never hurt Nicky. I mean, he loved her too much.
DEAN
Well, too much ain’t good. So let’s go talk to the mermaid’s boyfriend. Because apparently, imaginary friends have boyfriends now.
SULLY
Wait! Wait! We can’t just leave her here. It’s disturbing for the kid.
DEAN
All right, what do you wanna do? Find a giant toilet and flush it?
(Sully and Sam both look at Dean.)
DEAN
You’re right. I was... What would you like us to do?
SULLY
I think I saw some shovels back there.
DEAN
Kay.
(Sully leaves.)
DEAN
Well, Totoro really cares for you, huh?
(Sam remembers...)
(Motel room interior. Young Sam and Sully are lying on their backs on separate beds, heads hanging over the edges so they’re facing each other upside down.)
YOUNG SAM
Okay, I got one.
SULLY
Hit me.
YOUNG SAM
Ever think... you can fly?
SULLY
Sometimes. Like, on really windy days. You?
YOUNG SAM
I used to, but I broke my arm.
(Sully laughs, young Sam giggles.)
YOUNG SAM
Your turn.
SULLY
Okay. Ever think... you could eat ten waffles in one sitting?
YOUNG SAM
I hope so, when I’m big. Can you?
SULLY
I tried, once.
(Sully makes a dramatic vomiting sound. They both laugh and sit up on their beds.)
SULLY
Whoa, head rush.
YOUNG SAM
Ever think... about running away?
SULLY
From you? No way.
YOUNG SAM
No, I mean – from here. All this. The hunting life.
SULLY
Do you?
(Young Sam nods.)
SULLY
Hm. Ever think, that maybe you wanna go to school? Make some friends?
YOUNG SAM
But I have you.
SULLY
Yeah, you do. But one day you won’t. Sam, I want you to listen to me. You can be whatever you wanna be. You’re not Dean, you’re not your dad. You’re Sam. And Sam is so awesome.
YOUNG SAM
Can you imagine, running away? My dad would KILL me.
SULLY
Well... It’s your choice, Sam. It’s your life, I mean, it’s all up to you.
YOUNG SAM
Okay.
SULLY
Okay?
YOUNG SAM
Let’s go!
(Back in the present, Dean is shoveling dirt on top of Nicky’s body in a hole in the ground.)
DEAN
Hey, slacker. Am I burying Ariel by myself here or what?
SAM
No, yeah, of course.
DEAN
Let’s go.
SAM
How you holding up, Sully?
SULLY
I’m fine. How are you, Sam?
SAM
Aces.
(New scene – exterior, night.)
WEEMS
Don’t worry, kid. Everybody’s got a pee-pee problem. Weems will take care of these sheets, and mommy’ll be none the wiser.
FLETCHER
What if mommy hears us?
WEEMS
Fletcher, not even a parade can wake mommy up tonight.
FLETCHER
Because she drank her grown-up juice and went sleepy-bye?
WEEMS
Yep. Mommy drank a LOT of juice tonight. Hey, you wanna try and hit the sack?
(Fletcher nods.)
WEEMS
All right. I’ll catch you on the flip side, kay bud?
FLETCHER
Thanks, Weems.
WEEMS
You got it.
(Fletcher leaves. Weems hangs star-patterned sheets on a clothesline. A figure holding a dagger stalks Weems and stabs him. Falling to the ground, Weems sees the figure run off and start a car.)
WEEMS
Sully. Sully, Sully. Oh... Sull... Sully...
(Weems is wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a skeleton in a top hat holding a guitar, and the words “YOUR TIME IS GONNA COME”.)
(New scene – exterior, night. Sam, Dean and Sully are searching among the sheets on the clotheslines. They follow the blood stains into the garage where they find the wounded Weems.)
SULLY
Weems! Weems, are you okay?
WEEMS
Argh, yeah, ugh. It went right through my love handle. My fat saved me. Can you believe that?
SULLY
Fat is the best.
WEEMS
Yeah.
DEAN
Yeah, well, the mermaid wasn’t so lucky.
WEEMS
Is he talking to me? Who are these guys?
SULLY
They’re friends.
DEAN
Hey Weems, when was the last time you saw Nicky the mermaid? God, I can’t believe I just said that.
WEEMS
Yesterday. Why? What happened to Nicky?
SAM
She was murdered.
WEEMS
What??
SULLY
Weems, I am so sorry.
WEEMS
No! She... she was my girl!
SULLY
Sparkle’s gone, too.
WEEMS
Not Sparkle! Dude, that’s like our whole posse!
SULLY
I know, right? But hey, you’re okay. You’re okay.
DEAN
Okay, all right. So you’re all pals. Is there anybody who would have beef with the bunch of you?
WEEMS
I’ve never seen her before in my life.
SAM
Wait a second – you saw somebody?
WEEMS
Some chick. After she... shivved me, she took off in an old VW Bug.
SAM (to Dean)
So this is a good thing, right?
DEAN
Uh, no, this is a GREAT thing. I mean...
SULLY (to Weems)
It’s gross!
DEAN
... a manicorn, a freaking mermaid? What am I supposed to do with that? But a chick in a car? That’s terra firma. I’m home.
SAM
All right, you go. I’ll cover these two.
SULLY
It goes, it’s – yeah, it goes all the way through.
DEAN
I gotta ask. Hey, uh, acid wash. What’s so special about you?
WEEMS
Mermaids dig me?
DEAN
No, I mean, why do KIDS like you?
WEEMS
Oh. I play air guitar.
DEAN
You play air guitar? Sam plays air guitar. I can play air guitar.
(Weems sits up and plays air guitar. A fantastic guitar riff is heard corresponding to his hand movements. After the big finish he grabs his wounded side, groaning.)
SULLY
It’s okay, it’s okay. Good solo, good solo.
WEEMS
Thanks. Ugh.
DEAN
Well, he’s no Clapton.
SULLY
I’m gonna go get some bandages. Okay? Oh – I’ll be right back, Sam.
(Dean and Sully leave the garage.)
WEEMS
Wait. You’re not – THAT Sam? Sully’s Sam?
SAM
I guess I would be. Yeah.
WEEMS
So, now, you and Sully are, like, back together?
SAM
What?
WEEMS
How old are you?
SAM
Wrong.
WEEMS
Look, I get it, we all need a tune-up from time to time. It’s okay.
SAM
No. He, uh, came to ME. I’m helping HIM out.
WEEMS
Sam Winchester. I mean... Wow. Hey, just so you know – Sully? You broke his heart, man.
(Sam remembers...)
(Motel room interior, day. Young Sam hangs up the phone.)
SULLY (holding a bundle tied to a stick over his shoulder)
Ready to hit the road?
YOUNG SAM
No. My dad just called.
SULLY
Yeah?
YOUNG SAM
He changed his mind. Wants me to come with him.
SULLY
On a... on a hunt?
YOUNG SAM
Finally! He thinks I’m ready. I have to catch the next bus to Milwaukee.
SULLY
Are you sure this is what you want?
YOUNG SAM
I’m a Winchester. I hunt monsters. Why would I want anything else?
SULLY
Well, I – I’m not sure it’s you.
YOUNG SAM
Why can’t you be happy for me, Sully?
SULLY
Listen, buddy – I’m just afraid you’re going down a path you might be better off not going down.
YOUNG SAM
Yeah, but I’m not afraid.
SULLY
I know you’re not. You’re one of the bravest kids I know! It’s just... this whole hunting thing, you know, it’s not the only way. There are so many other ways. And you can find one, Sam. You can leave, right now.
YOUNG SAM
I don’t want another way. I wanna be with my dad and... and Dean.
SULLY
Look, Sam, I’m just saying this ’cause I’m your friend.
YOUNG SAM
Pretend friend! You’re not even real.
SULLY
Well, I’m – I’m here, as long as you need me.
YOUNG SAM
I don’t need you anymore, Sully. I don’t even know why I made you up in the first place. I wish I could UNMAKE you up.
SULLY
If – if that’s what you want.
YOUNG SAM
It is, okay? Just go.
SULLY
You have a good, long life, Sam.
(Sully disappears. Young Sam grabs his stuff and leaves the motel room.)
(Back in the present – same garage interior, night.)
WEEMS
No, you did a good job.
SULLY
Is it too tight?
WEEMS
No.
SULLY
All right, that’s good. Okay. There you go, pal.
WEEMS
All right. I’m gonna go check on Fletcher. Kid has a bladder like a sieve.
(Weems leaves.)
SAM
You know, it’s... pretty awesome. How you help everyone around you.
SULLY
Doesn’t always work out, but... I try.
SAM
Sully... I feel awful. About how we left off. I’m sorry. I was a kid. I was a – a jerk kid. And – and you were trying to help, and...
SULLY
That’s all on me. I mean, goodbyes are part of the job, and ours was...
SAM
Pretty bad.
SULLY (laughing)
Yeah, it was really bad. You know, I’m not gonna lie to ya – when you went off to hunt, I considered that one of my biggest failures. It just seemed so clear to me that you wanted something else. But – I was wrong. And it all worked out, didn’t it?
SAM
I don’t know about that.
SULLY
Come on. You’re a hero. Sam, you saved the world. I keep track of my kids. And you did really good, Sam.
SAM
Well... Not all good. There was some bad. And some really bad. Sully – I screwed up. I let something out into the world that was...
SULLY
You mean the Darkness? That’s what the others are calling it, I’ve just heard rumors.
SAM
I’m gonna fix it. I am. Dean and I, we’re – we’re gonna fix it. It’s just...
SULLY
What is it?
SAM
I think God wants to help us fix it. But I don’t think I can do what he’s asking.
SULLY
How bad is it?
SAM
There’s this Cage in hell, and it’s where they keep Lucifer. And I’ve been in it, and it’s... And I think God wants me to go back.
SULLY
Ever think... about running away anymore?
SAM
I did. Um, I mean, I have. But not in a while. Not anymore.
(Sam’s phone buzzes. It’s a text from Dean: “Found her. Meet me at 1534 George St. Bring Sully.”)
SAM
Ever think... about hot-wiring a minivan?
SULLY
In my dreams.
SAM
Let’s do it.
(New scene – interior, night. Dean’s phone gets an incoming text from Sam: “On our way”. Someone else is holding the phone. Dean is just waking up to find himself tied to a post.)
REESE
Good. You’re awake. Your brother’s on the way.
(Dean remembers finding the VW Bug and getting knocked out.)
DEAN
Who the hell are you?
REESE
I think we have a mutual imaginary friend. You know Sully?
(Sam and Sully come in through the door. Reese holds a dagger against Dean’s throat. Sam aims a gun at her.)
SAM
Hold it.
SULLY
Reese?
REESE
Hey, stranger.
REESE (to Sam)
You give me Sully, I give you your brother.
SAM
What do you want with Sully?
REESE
Ask him. He’s the one who killed my sister.
SULLY
It was an accident!
SAM
What?
SULLY
Reese and her twin sister, they were my first kids after I thought I screwed things up with you.
REESE
So this is his fault?
SULLY
No! No, Reese, I’m the one that bungled it. It was me. I should never have let her chase me into the street. We were just playing tag. I don’t know why I didn’t see the car coming. That’s why I never went back in the field, that’s why I never found another kid. I was too scared I’d hurt’em.
REESE
Do you know how bad you messed me up? “Audrey’s dead because of the invisible man.” Try telling that to about ten different kiddie shrinks! I always wondered if Sully was real, so I got obsessed with folklore. I studied abroad in Romania, and then I found out he’s a Zanna.
SAM
Yes, and Zanna are good.
REESE
That’s what the witch tried to tell me, too.
SAM
The witch?
REESE
She sold me a spell, so that I’d be able to see these freaks. She gave me this, too.
(Reese looks down at the dagger she’s holding.)
REESE
Finally, I can save other kids from these monsters.
SULLY
So you killed my friends just to get to me?
REESE
And I would have done it sooner if these two hadn’t shown up.
SULLY
Why didn’t you call? I would’e come.
REESE
Honestly, I kinda liked watching you suffer. You weren’t just Audrey’s best friend – you were mine, too. And after she died, Sully, I... I never needed you more.
SULLY
I panicked when Audrey died. And I left you to deal with the pain, ’cause I couldn’t handle being the one that caused it.
REESE
So maybe I’ll take something YOU love, Sully – a REAL person.
SAM
That’s not gonna happen.
SULLY
Will killing me make you feel better?
SAM
No, Sully, that’s not the answer.
SULLY
This is what I do. Whatever’s best for the kid. Reesy – if this is what you need, I’m okay with it.
REESE
I’m still mad. I can’t stop it. I’m just still so MAD!
DEAN
Reese.
(Dean, having wiggled out of the ropes, stands up.)
DEAN
Trust me. Revenge? Ain’t gonna make you feel better. Listen, I’ve seen more than my share of monsters. And I mean REAL monsters, bad. These guys? These are Sesame Street mother Teresas. But when I wasn’t there for my little brother, Sully was. Now, look, I’m not saying that he didn’t make a mistake, but you know that there is not a monstrous bone in his body.
SULLY
I’m so, SO sorry.
(Reese, crying, drops the dagger and hugs Sully.)
SULLY
Oh Reesy, I’m so sorry.
(New scene – exterior, night. The VW Bug drives away, Sully waving it off. Then he turns to Sam.)
SULLY
Well, now that you know about Audrey, you probably never wanna see me again.
SAM
Ever think... maybe you’re a hero to me?
SULLY (scoffs mildly)
Yeah.
SAM
Sully. One thing I’ve learned – heroes aren’t perfect.
SULLY
Mm. Sometimes they’re scared. But that just means the thing that they’re facing, it’s super important. And nobody else is gonna go for it, because nobody else has got the balls.
(Dean walks up to them.)
SULLY
Well, it is that time again.
DEAN
You, um, you’ll look in on Reese?
SULLY
Don’t worry, I will be checking in. And Dean, thank you for looking out for Sam. You are not a germ at all.
DEAN
Thanks? You know, you’re not gonna get me to admit that you’re not the weirdest thing out there, but... you’re a good weird.
SULLY (to Sam)
Good luck, buddy.
(Sully disappears.)
DEAN
Let’s do it.
(New scene – Impala interior, night.)
SAM
Dean, we need to seriously discuss me going to the Cage.
DEAN
Okay. Not happening. Good talk. – Sam, even if these visions are real...
SAM
Yeah. It’s Lucifer? And me? In the Cage? I know. But this – this lump in my throat... It’s not an excuse. Not anymore.
DEAN
We’ll find another way. Okay? There’s always another way.
SAM
Okay. Then tell me – what is the other way?
