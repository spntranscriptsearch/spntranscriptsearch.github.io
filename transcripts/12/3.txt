TEASER:


Man: "Played out." You're kidding. That place was great.


Woman: Another avocado toast? Please.


Man: Yeah, but avocado toast with quail egg? Genius.


Man: How many stars you giving 'em?


Woman: Two.


Man: Four.


Man: You realize our ratings are just gonna cancel each other out.


LOOKING AT A COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT SIGN


Woman: Should've bought here when we had the chance. I mean, new restos, new stores–


Man: New prices. Neighborhood's been picked clean by flippers – and condo developers.


MAN LOOKS DOWN AT HIS PHONE WHILE CONTINUING WALKING


SOUND OF BABY CRYING


Woman: Did you hear that?


MAN LOOKS UP FROM PHONE AND LISTENS


Man: Yeah, it came from that house over there.


CAMERA PANS OVER ABANDONED LOOKING HOUSE


Woman: Yeah, but who'd want to live in there?


Man: Squatters or crackheads?


MAN DISMISSIVELY LOOKS BACK DOWN AT HIS PHONE


Woman: With a baby?


CRYING BABY SOUNDS CONTINUE, WOMAN LOOKS INCREASINGLY CONCERNED.


Woman: Call 9-1-1.


LOOKS UP FROM HIS PHONE


Man: What?


WOMAN MOVES TOWARDS HOUSE


Woman: Do it!


Man: Okay, okay.


DIALS 9-1-1


Operator through phone: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?


Man: Hi, there's a baby in distress in an abandoned house at...


MAN LOOKS AT HOUSE FOR ADDRESS AND NOTICES WOMAN IS WALKING UP STEPS TO HOUSE


Man: Nat!


NAT OPENS FRONT DOOR AND WALKS IN.


Nat: Hello?


NAT WALKS AROUND THE MAIN FLOOR FOLLOWING CRYING BABY SOUNDS. SHE WALKS INTO A BEDROOM AND DISCOVERS A CRIB WITH A FLICKERING LIGHT ABOVE IT. SHE LEANS OVER AND FOLDS BLANKET DOWN AND FINDS A CREEPY DOLL IN THE CRIB. SHE JUMPS BACK INTO THE MAN WHO HAS NOW CAUGHT UP AND ENTERED THE ROOM BEHIND HER.


Man: What?


NAT IS TERRIFIED AND JUST SHAKES HER HEAD. SUDDENLY SHE JUMPS AGAIN AND GRABS HER ARM.


Nat: Something touched my arm. I mean, it's something–


BOTH ARE NOW PANICKING AND DECIDE TO LEAVE.


Man: We have to get out of here now.


Nat: Okay.


THEY TURN TO LEAVE THE ROOM AND THE DOOR SLAMS CLOSED ON THEM. THROUGH THE CLOSED DOOR THEY BOTH START SCREAMING.


SUPERNATURAL TITLE CARD.




MARY SITS ALONE AT A TABLE IN THE MEN OF LETTERS BUNKER, LOOKING THROUGH JOHN'S JOURNAL. IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. CASTIEL LOOKS CONCERNED AND WALKS UP TO MARY. SHE SEES HIM AND SMILES TIREDLY AT HIM.


Mary: Castiel. What are you doing up?


Castiel: Oh, I’m always up. Angels don't need sleep.


MARY LOOKS SURPRISED AT THAT INFORMATION, AND LOOKS DOWN TOWARDS THE JOURNAL AGAIN.


Mary: Wish I had the problem.


CASTIEL ENTERS THE ROOM FURTHER AND WALKS UP TO THE TABLE MARY IS SITTING AT. SHE SIGHS AND CLOSES THE JOURNAL.


Mary: Anyway...I think I'll go try again.


SHE STANDS UP AND STARTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE TABLE.


Mary: Wish me luck.


Castiel: Luck.


MARY STOPS AND TURNS AROUND TO LOOK AT CASTIEL


Mary: Castiel?


CASTIEL TURNS AROUND TO FACE MARY.


Mary: After you left heaven, when did it start to feel like...like you fit, like you...belonged here?


Castiel: Well, I'm still not sure I do.


MARY GIVES A SMALL SIGH AND SMILES, THEN TURNS BACK AROUND TO LEAVE. CASTIEL SPEAKS TO HER AGAIN.


Castiel: Mary...you DO belong here.


MARY SMILES


Mary: Goodnight, Castiel.


CUTS TO MARY WASHING HER FACE AND GETTING READY FOR BED. SHE STARES AT HERSELF IN THE MIRROR FOR A MOMENT BEFORE PICKING UP SOME SCISSORS AND CUTTING HER HAIR.



THE BOYS ARE SITTING IN THE KITCHEN EATING BREAKFAST.


Dean: All right, so what have you found on her Majesty's Secret Suckbags?


Sam: Well, I may have turned the bunker upside down looking for any reference whatsoever to the British Men of Letters, and all I found was this letter tucked into an old ledger, uh, from the "London Chapterhouse."


Dean: Okay, well that's something.


Sam: Yeah uh...not so much.


SAM TURNS LETTER AROUND AND MOST OF THE LETTER IS BLACKED OUT. DEAN TAKES THE LETTER TO LOOK AT IT.


Dean: Awesome.


CASTIEL WALKS INTO THE DOORWAY OF THE KITCHEN


Dean: Morning, sunshine. Some coffee?


Castiel: No, thank you. I have to go.


CASTIEL WALKS AWAY. SAM AND DEAN GET UP TO FOLLOW WHERE CASTIEL WENT.


Sam: Cass?


Dean: Cass, wait up.


Sam: Hey. Wait a second. Where you off to?


CASTIEL PAUSES AND TURNS AROUND TO ANSWER


Castiel: Cleveland, Ohio.


Sam: For what?


Castiel: I think I may have a lead on Lucifer. I found a police report in Cleveland about a man whose eyes flared a glowing red. It could be Lucifer in a new body.


Dean: All right. Yeah, that sounds like something. We should go check it out.


Castiel: No. The Devil is free because of me. Finding him is my responsibility.


Sam: Cass, you're gonna want some backup on this.


Castiel: If it is him, I will call you. In the meantime, I think you're needed here.


CASTIEL NODS HIS HEAD AT THE BOYS AND TURNS AND WALKS AWAY.


Dean: The hell was that about?


Sam: Mom?


THE BOYS TURN AND HEAD BACK TO THE KITCHEN


Dean: What are you talking about? Mom's fine.


Sam: Sure. I heard her walking around all night last night. I mean don't you think she seems a bit...withdrawn? You know...shaky?


THEY MAKE IT BACK TO THE KITCHEN AND SIT BACK DOWN AT THE TABLE


Dean: Of course she's shaky. She hasn't been on this planet since Jane Fonda was wearing leg warmers. Look, all she needs is a little R&R. You know, some good family time...she'll be aces.


Sam: Yeah.


MARY WALKS INTO THE KITCHEN


Sam and Dean: Hey.


Mary: Hey. Hi.


Sam: Hey. Morning.


MARY SEES THE BACON SITTING ON A PLATE ON THE TABLE


Mary: Ooh.


Sam: Oh, we can fry up some more. That's – that's probably cold by now mom.


Mary: It's bacon.


Dean: Wow. We are SO related.


MARY AND DEAN SMILE AND LAUGH


Sam: Did you cut your hair?


Mary: I'm gonna keep it short if I'm gonna go out on a hunt, you know? Why give the bad guys the advantage of long pullable hair right?


Dean: Wow. I've been trying to tell Sam that for years.


Sam: Did you say, uh, "going out on a hunt"?


Mary: I found a case.


Sam: I thought you were still struggling with even the IDEA of the Internet.


Mary: I had Dean pick up some newspapers when he went into town.


Dean: Whoa, whoa. I...You didn't tell me you were looking for a case.


Mary: I wasn't. I just...found one. Minnesota. Two dead, locked room. Victims had put in a call about a crying baby. But the place was empty. The only thing at the scene as their bodies. Been five days, and the coroner still hasn't put out a cause of death. Seemed fishy.


THE BOYS DON'T LOOK VERY HAPPY ABOUT THEIR MOM WANTING TO WORK A CASE


Mary: It's probably nothing. I just thought I might...get out there, stretch my legs.


Sam: I-I thought you-you weren't down to hunt in the first place.


Dean: Well things change, right? Family hunting trip.


MARY LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE DOESN'T REALLY WANT THE BOYS TO COME, BUT RELENTS.


Mary: Sure.


Dean: All right. Meet at the car in 10.


DEAN GETS UP FROM THE TABLE LOOKING HAPPY TO BE HUNTING WITH HIS MOM. SAM STILL SITS AT THE TABLE LOOKING UPSET AT THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING.


Sam: What about the R&R?


Dean: W–


DEAN GESTURES TO WHERE MARY HAS ALREADY LEFT


Dean: Look, man, Cass healed your s'mores foot, all right? I got Baby back to mint. We're road ready. And if mom wants to hunt, I say we hunt. You're gonna...


DEAN WAVES HIS ARM AND POINTS AT THE BREAKFAST DISHES ON THE TABLE. CUT TO THE BOYS AND MARY AT A GAS STATION WHERE SAM IS FILLING UP THE IMPALA AND MARY WAITS IN THE CAR. DEAN WALKS BACK TO THE CAR FROM THE CONVENIENCE STORE.


Dean: Nice bike. There's a lot of things that have gone to seed since you were here, but the variety in snack food flavors is not one of them.


DEAN GETS INTO THE CAR WHILE SAME FINISHES FILLING THE CAR


Dean: We got your teriyaki jerky, we got your sriracha, and we got your chili lime, which...is my personal favorite.


DEAN OPENS UP A BAG OF CHILI LIME JERKY


Mary: Let's give chili lime a whirl.


SAM GETS INTO THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR


Dean: Eh?


Mary: It's...good. Artificial, kinda tingly.


Dean: That's how you know it's working.


Born To Be Wild PLAYS ON THE RADIO. SAM MOTIONS FOR DEAN TO TURN THE MUSIC DOWN.


Sam: Hey.


MARY REACHED OVER AND TURNS IT UP INSTEAD. SAM JUST HALF SMILES AND DEAN GRINS AND PEELS OUT OF THE GAS STATION.



TOMMY SITS ON CHAIR LOST IN THOUGHT AND CONFUSED WITH A DRINK IN HAND. THE CAMERA PANS OUT AND WE SEE THAT CASTIEL IS OPPOSITE TOMMY ASKING HIM QUESTIONS.


Tommy: Look...I been around all stripes of Vince, all right? Drunk Vince, depressed Vince, megalomaniacal "I'm a Golden God" Vince. The Vince who threw me through that door...that wasn't him. And it wasn't just his eyes, man. I-I mean, the strength. He was like – He was like and MMA fighter. Hell, he was like 20.


Castiel: If you hear from him, don't hesitate to call.


Tommy: Okay, Agent...Beyonce?


CASTIEL GIVES TOMMY HIS CARD AND THEN GETS UP TO LEAVE, WALKING PAST THE BAR, WHERE CROWLEY SITS, ON HIS WAY OUT.


Crowley: I guess that makes me Agent Jay Z.


CASTIEL STOPS IN HIS TRACKS AND TURNS AROUND WITH AN ANGRY LOOK ON HIS FACE



MARY AND THE BOYS ARE AT THE CORONER'S OFFICE SHOWING THEIR FBI BADGES.


Mary: Agent Shirley Partridge, out of the Minneapolis field office. These are my partners, Agent Cassidy and Agent Bonaduce.


Coroner: This is a local case. Why would the FBI be interest–


Mary: They're new. Wanted their first case to have training wheels.


Coroner: Mm.


Mary: We wanted to have a look at the bodies.


Sam: Now you haven't filed a report. Has there been any problem determining the cause of death?


Coroner: Problem? No. No, no, no. I figured out the cause. Just doesn't make any damn sense.


DEAN WANDERS AROUND TO THE SIDE OF THE WOMAN'S BODY WHILE THE CORONER SPEAKS. HE NOTICES A MARK ON HER ARM.


Dean: Is this a burn?


Coroner: Frostbite. Yeah. Both victims died of acute hypothermia...in a 65 degree room.


MARY AND THE BOYS LOOK SURPRISED AT THE CORONER'S STATEMENTS


Coroner: When I opened them up, their hearts were literally – and I mean literally – frozen. Wanna tell me how to present that to the public? Or to their families? So much for training wheels huh?



CASTIEL WALKS OUT OF THE BUILDING TO HIS TRUCK WITH CROWLEY FOLLOWING HIM TALKING ABOUT TEAMING UP TO DEFEAT LUCIFER.


Crowley: Bumping into each other, working the same leads. What are the odds, Cassie? Fate brought us together.


Castiel: I'm not interested.


Crowley: Why not? We made a somewhat effective team against Amara. It's been months, I mean MONTHS since we last tried to kill each other. We both got very, very good reasons to want Lucifer dead.


THEY REACH CASTIEL'S TRUCK AND PROCEED TO TRY AND SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER ALTERNATELY OVER THE HOOD OF THE TRUCK AND THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOWS.


Crowley: Besides...while you were gabbing with Vince's second fiddle, I was ransacking his room. Found these. Postcards from his beloved sister Wendy. Oh, lookie here. An address and everything. Worth a look.


CROWLEY TOSSES SOME POSTCARDS ONTO THE FRONT SEAT OF THE TRUCK. CASTIEL TAKES THE POSTCARDS AND LOOKS AT THEM.



MARY AND THE BOYS WALK INTO THE ABANDONED HOUSE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND WITH SOME EQUIPMENT.


Dean: You sure you go the swing of that thing?


Mary: For the third time, yes. Dean, it's analog. I'm good.


Dean: Right.


MARY WANDERS INTO THE BEDROOM WITH THE CRIB AND DOLL INSIDE. SAM AND DEAN GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. MARY'S EQUIPMENT IS GOING OFF AND THE LIGHT ABOVE THE CRIB STARTS FLICKERING. SHE TURNS HER EQUIPMENT OFF AND PULLS BACK THE BLANKET ON THE DOLL.


Dean: Mom, we got something over here.


MARY POCKETS HER EQUIPMENT AND TURNS TO HEAD OUT OF THE ROOM. THE DOOR SLAMS IN HER FACE.


Mary: Sam?


Dean: Mom?


Mary: Dean?


MARY TRIES TO GET THE DOOR OPEN, BUT IT WON'T BUDGE.


Dean: Mom? Mom.


Mary: Sam! Dean!


Dean: Mom! Hold on, mom! We're coming!


MARY IS STILL TRYING TO GET THE DOOR OPEN


Dean: Mom, get away from the door.


MARY BACKS AWAY FROM THE DOOR, WHILE HOLDING HER FLASHLIGHT UP. A SMALL HAND GRABS HER ARM. SHE TURNS TO LOOK AND SEES A SMALL BLONDE BOY. DEAN FINALLY BREAKS THE DOOR OPEN. SAM GRABS MARY AND DEAN SWINGS HIS CROWBAR THROUGH THE GHOST OF THE BOY, CAUSING HIM TO DISSIPATE. DEAN LOOKS AROUND AT MARY. SHE HOLDS HER ARM UP TO THE LIGHT OF SAM'S FLASHLIGHT AND SEES THAT THERE IS A RED HANDPRINT ON HER ARM.


Sam: Mom, you're hurt.


DEAN COMES OVER AND LOOKS AT MARY'S ARM


Dean: Let's go. Come on. Come on.


Mary: Okay.


CAMERA PANS OUT ON THE DOLL'S FACE, THEN THE CRIB.



NEXT DAY, BOYS ARE WORKING ON THEIR COMPUTERS, MARY COMES INTO THE ROOM.


Mary: Okay, ready to head out? Go knock on some doors?


Dean: Doors?


Mary: Yeah. Talk to the neighbors, hit up the Hall of Records, work the...case? We still do that right?


Dean: Sometimes. But the, uh, the internet has made a lot of that legwork...obsolete.


Sam: I mean, I'm already in the St. Paul Police Department database.


Dean: Anything?


Sam: Yeah, a lot. I got police reports filed form 2004...uh, '91, '89. '85, '78. All deaths. All kids. Looks like it started with this girl here. Elizabeth Moriarty.


Mary: You got all that from THAT...


Sam: Yeah.


MARY BACKS UP TO SIT DOWN ON ONE OF THE BEDS LOOKING OVERWHELMED BY THE NEW TECHNOLOGY


Sam: Mom...don't worry about it. We'll teach you how to do this.



CASTIEL AND CROWLEY GET OUT OF THE TRUCK IN FRONT OF WENDY'S HOUSE. CASTIEL USES THE SIDE MIRROR TO CHECK AND FIX HIS HAIR, WHILE CROWLEY STANDS AND WAITS IMPATIENTLY FOR HIM. THEY KNOCK ON WENDY'S DOOR.


Castiel: Hello. I'm Agent Beyonce, and this is my, um...my partner, Agent Zee. Um, we wanted to ask you a few questions about your bro...


WENDY CLOSES THE DOOR IN CASTIEL'S FACE


Castiel: ...ther. Do you think that happens to Sam and Dean?


Crowley: Oh, all the time.


CUT TO INTERIOR OF HOUSE WHERE WENDY IS ON THE PHONE LEAVING A MESSAGE FOR VINCE


Wendy: Vinny, please call me. I got two federal agents asking for you. Don't know what was with you yesterday, but you're in trouble.


CROWLEY MATERIALIZES INSIDE THE HOUSE


Crowley: How right you are, Wendy.


CROWLEY WALKS TO THE FRONT DOOR AND OPENS IT FOR CASTIEL


Crowley: Ah. So...Vince was here. Yesterday.


Castiel: Odd. She's been recently healed.


Crowley: Is that so? Let me guess – your brother got you up and walking again. And how are you enjoying the use of those legs? You know, the gift he gave you, I can take away like –


CROWLEY LIFTS HIS HAND TO SNAP HIS FINGERS, BUT CASTIEL GRABS HIS HAND BEFORE HE CAN.


Castiel: The thing that healed you, that wasn't your brother. Something...something else, something old and evil. I...I think a part of you knows that. We don't want to hurt Vince. We wanna help him.


Wendy: He showed up out of the blue and he fixed me like a miracle. But he did it cold, like...it was nothing to him. Like he was running an errand. Barely said a word. And then he just took off with his groupie friend.


Castiel: His groupie friend?


Wendy: Red-headed broad. Didn't say much.


CASTIEL TURNS AROUND TO LOOK ANGRILY AT CROWLEY. CROWLEY LOOKS SHEEPISHLY DOWN.


CUT TO CASTIEL AND CROWLEY WALKING OUT OF WENDY'S FRONT DOOR.


Crowley: So Vince's cabin in Sagamore Hills...apparently, all of his greatest records were written there – "Serpentine," "Theatre of Mercy" …


Castiel: I should've known there was something you weren't telling me. Rowena?


Crowley: So mother and I had an unfortunate, if not rather embarrassing, run-in with Lucifer. You're just mad because you're only my second choice for a Lucifer-hunt team-up.


Castiel: (said sarcastically) No, actually I think it's sweet. I thought your motivation was ambition and revenge, but now I know you just wanna save your mother.


Crowley: It's not about saving her. Lucifer has made off with a colossally powerful witch who, by the way, is the only person alive who can slam him back in the cage. He will either kill her, control her, or she will offer her services to the biggest bad in town in order to save her neck, like she always does. Do any of those sound like particularly good outcomes to you?


CASTIEL DOESN'T LOOK VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE OPTIONS PRESENTED BY CROWLEY, BUT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE KNOWS CROWLEY IS RIGHT.



VIEW OF OLD TRUCK PARKED IN FRONT OF VINCE'S CABIN.


Lucifer: You got any beauty spells locked up in that witchy brain of your?


CUT TO INTERIOR OF CABIN. LUCIFER IS LOOKING AT HIS DEGRADING VESSEL IN THE MIRROR, ROWENA IS STANDING BEHIND HIM IN CHAINS


Lucifer: Huh? Thought this one would last a bit longer before going all Keith Richards on me. This vessel hopping's getting old. Just as I get used to the limitations of one meatsack, I gotta cut bait and jump to the next flawed lump.


Rowena: Then you want me to make this vessel permanent? Strong enough to hold you?


Lucifer: Does look good on me. Show me what you got, Red. Huh?


Rowena: I-I-I'd help, I would, but I don't have the Book of the Damned. I lost it.


Lucifer: You know damned well where you put it. Did you see what I did there? "Damned." Besides, you don't NEED the book. Clever girl like you must have it all UP HERE by now.


Rowena: And if I refuse?


Lucifer: I snap your neck again. Only this time, I'll rip your head clean off afterwards. Hmm?


LUCIFER LOOKS QUITE PLEASED WITH HIMSELF, ROWENA LOOKS VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT HER CURRENT SITUATION



THE BOYS AND MARY ARE BACK AT THE HOTEL ROOM DOING MORE RESEARCH ON THE CASE


Dean: Mylings?


Sam: Yeah, from Scandinavian lore. Uh, children's spirits, vengeful ones. "Their cries to help lure adults to their death."


Mary: Anything about frozen hearts?


Sam: Uh, no, not yet. But this is just from old, incomplete folk accounts. We all know the lore isn't always 100%.


Mary: Hmm. Mm, maybe, but...all I know is, that little boy who grabbed me, I...he didn't wanna hurt me. He was scared.


Sam: Yeah, um...it must've felt that way, but, mom, the victims were all lured to their death by a baby's cry. Uh, the spirit marked Natalia right before she was killed, the same way the spirit marked you. I mean, if we hadn't gotten there in time...


Dean: Well, look, we know all the kids' names, right? We know that they're all buried locally, so I say we salt and burn 'em. That’s the safe bet.


Sam: Agreed.


Dean: All right. Well, let's do that.


MARY DOESN'T SEEM CONVINCED BY THE CONCLUSION THE BOYS HAVE COME TO.


INTERNAL SCENE: MARY.


FLASH OF HANDPRINT ON HER ARM. CUT TO MARY KISSING LITTLE DEAN GOODNIGHT.


Dean: Sammy!


FLASH OF OUTSIDE OF WINCHESTER HOUSE, CUT TO CRIB INSIDE OF ABANDONED HOUSE WITH SOUNDS OF BABY CRYING. GHOST OF LITTLE BOY LUCAS APPEARS


Lucas: Help me.


BACK TO EXTERNAL SCENE. MARY SITS DOWN HEAVILY ON THE BED HOLDING HER HEAD


Dean: Mom?


THE BOYS GET UP FROM THE TABLE AND GO OVER TO MARY


Dean: Hey, you okay?


Sam: Mom?


Mary: Yeah, fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.


MARY STANDS UP WITH THE BOYS


Mary: I'm fine.


Sam: May – Maybe, uh, you should stay here.


MARY LOOKS RATHER DISPLEASED AT THE SUGGESTION. DEAN PULLS OUT HIS PHONE AND HANDS IT TO HER.


Dean: Here. Call if you need us.


MARY TAKES THE PHONE


Mary: Okay.


Dean: All right?


Sam: Back soon.


SAM AND DEAN GRAB THEIR STUFF AND HEAD OUT THE DOOR. MARY LOOKS AROUND THE ROOM AND THE LOOKS CONFUSEDLY AT THE CELL PHONE BEFORE PUTTING IT ON THE DESK AND PICKING UP THE CORDLESS PHONE TO USE.


Phone: Ramsey County. Register of Deeds.


Mary: Hello, I'm looking for contact information for the last owner of 1781 Chamberlin Street, please.


Phone: Uh...Okay, can't you just use the website like everyone else?


Mary: I'm not everyone else. Please? And...thank you.


CUT TO MARY ON THE PHONE WITH PREVIOUS OWNER OF HOUSE, CHERYL


Cheryl: Lucas...was so cold. I still don’t understand what happened. I checked on him just a minute before I found him. How'd he get so cold so fast? Gosh, sorry for going on like this.


Mary: Oh, don't apologize. What did Lucas look like?


Cheryl: Well, he was so handsome. Blonde hair and these crystal blue eyes.


Mary: Anything else?


Cheryl: He had a scar on his cheek. From the neighbor's dog.


Mary: Thank you, Cheryl. I'm sorry for dredging all this up again.


Cheryl: Oh, it's okay. Actually, it's kinda nice. No one talks on the phone anymore, you know?


Mary: I've noticed. Thank you again.


MARY HANGS UP THE PHONE



THE BOYS ARE AT THE GRAVEYARD DIGGING UP THE GRAVES OF ALL THE CHILDREN AND SALTING AND BURNING THEIR BONES.


Sam: Grim work.


Dean: Yeah.


Sam: You know, I'm worried about mom.


Dean: Why?


Sam: You're not?


Dean: She's back. I mean, yeah, she's still working out the kinks. We're all still working out the kinks. But, I mean, can't we, for once, just not turn everything into a problem? You know, can we, for once, just have ONE good thing?


Sam: Mom's not a thing.


Dean: Okay.


Sam: Look, I'm happy, too, Dean. I am. I'm overjoyed. But...there's something about her. I mean, something's going on with her.


Dean: Yeah, she's adjusting.


Sam: No, she's struggling. I mean, she's trying to bury herself in hunting to avoid dealing.


Dean: And how do you know that?


Sam: Years of personal experience. I don’t know man. Uh...like mother, like sons.


DEAN LOOKS PISSED AT THE CONVERSATION, BUT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE.




THE BOYS COME BACK TO THE HOTEL ROOM WHERE THEY LEFT MARY AND FIND THAT SHE'S GONE


Dean: Mom?


THE BOYS LOOK ALARMED THAT MARY ISN'T THERE


Sam: Weapons bag is missing.


THEY BOTH REALIZE THAT MARY HAS GONE BACK TO THE HOUSE



MARY ENTERS THE CHAMBERLIN HOUSE, WALKING TOWARDS THE BACK BEDROOM. LUCAS APPEARS IN FRONT OF HER.


Mary: Lucas. That's your name, isn't it? I talked to your mommy. She misses you so much.


LUCAS TURNS AND TALKS OVER TO POINT AT THE BASEMENT DOOR, THEN DISAPPEARS. MARY PRIES OPENS THE DOOR AND HEADS DOWN WITH A FLASHLIGHT. LUCAS APPEARS BEFORE HER AGAIN.


Mary: Lucas, why did you bring me here?


Lucas: Help...us.


MARY'S PHONE RINGS, SHE ANSWERS AND IT'S THE BOYS.


Mary: Hello?


Sam: Mom, where are you?


Mary: I'm at the Chamberlin house, on a hunch.


Dean: Yeah, we salted and burned all the remains.


Mary: Yeah. Didn't work.


Dean: Okay, get out of the house and wait for us.


THE PHONE CALL STARTS BREAKING UP


Mary: What? Hello?


Dean: Mom?


Mary: Hello?


Sam: Mom?


Dean: Let's go.


THE BOYS LEAVE TO GO FIND MARY AT THE CHAMERLIN HOUSE



LUCIFER IS STANDING WITH HIS SHIRT OFF, ROWENA IS PUTTING MARKING ON HIS CHEST.


Rowena: Ash of the Hawthorn Tree.


Lucifer: The pattern?


Rowena: A Druidic glyph. I'm using a hybrid spell of my own device – Book of the Damned and Celtic magic. Should give your vessel the resiliency and strength of the mightiest tree.


Lucifer: Oh. There's a woody joke in there somewhere. Let's get back to that nagging little word – "should."


LUCIFER GRABS ROWENA THREATENINGLY


Rowena: I-I can't promise the spell will last forever. There's no known magic for that. But it will last.


LUCIFER RELEASES ROWENA AND SHE TURNS AROUND TO GATHER THE REST OF THE SPELL LOOKING ANGRY.


Rowena: The final step.


ROWENA LIGHTS SOME INCENSE AND WALKS BACK TOWARDS LUCIFER AND STARTS WALKING A CIRCLE AROUND HIM.


Rowena: Permission to speak, Dark Lord? If – WHEN the spell succeeds and you are restored to your full glory...


Lucifer: Will I just kill you?


Rowena: I can be of value beyond this spell.


Lucifer: We'll see.


Rowena: Thank you, my Liege.


SHE FINISHED HER CIRCLE OF LUCIFER AND PLACES HER HAND ON HIS CHEST OVER THE GLYPH SHE'S DRAWN. SHE LOOKS UP AT LUCIFER AND SPEAKS THE ACTIVATION WORD.


Rowena: FES..TI..NA!


THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT, ROWENA BACKS AWAY AND LUCIFER SEEMS TO REALIZE THE SPELL IS NOT WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS.


Lucifer: Red, what did you do?


Rowena: Sped up the decaying process, my Lord. You thought Keith Richards was bad? Try Iggy Pop.


Lucifer: Oh, decapitation is far too merciful for you, Ginger Bitch!


ROWENA THROWS SOMETHING INTO HER CAULDRON. THERE A FLASH OF FIRE AND LUCIFER YELLS AND BACKS AWAY SLIGHTLY.


Lucifer: Aah! No! You can't destroy me!


Rowena: Not yet, but I can send you far, far away. Try finding a new vessel at the bottom of the bloody ocean. ABI!


Lucifer: Aah!


LUCIFER DISAPPEARS IN A FLASH OF PURPLE LIGHT.



CUT TO MARY BACK AT THE CHAMBERLIN HOUSE


Mary: What's keeping you here?


LUCAS POINTS TO THE CORNER OF THE BASEMENT


Lucas: Him.


THE HOUSE STARTS SHAKING AND MARY RUNS BACK UPSTAIRS. SHE TURNS AROUND AND THE GHOST OF A MAN IS BEHIND HER.


Mary: You're the father of that little girl. You killed them ALL, all those ch–


THE GHOST USES HIS POWERS TO PULL MARY TOWARDS HIM AND PLACES HIS HAND ON HER CHEST AND STARTS TO FREEZE HER. THE BOYS HAVE JUST ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE.


Dean: Mom!


MARY COLLAPSES TO HER KNEES AND DEAN RUSHES FORWARDS


Dean: Mom. Hey. Come on.


MARY THROW HER ELBOW AT DEAN, SENDING HIM INTO THE WALL.


Dean: Uhh!


Sam: Dean? She's possessed.


CLOSE UP OF MARY'S FACE




SAM AND DEAN LOOK UNSURE OF WHAT TO DO. SAM REACHES FOR SOME CHAIN, BUT MARY SENDS HIM FLYING INTO A SHELF IN THE WALL. SHE RUSHES DEAN AND PUSHES HIM AGAINST THE WALL, CHOKING HIM AND FREEZING HIM.


Mary/Ghost: MY house. MY children. Forever.


Dean: Mom? You can fight this.


Sam: Mom?


Mary: Aah!


MARY DROPS DEAN AND COLLAPSES TO HER KNEES.


Sam: Mom.


Mary: The basement. Go!


SAM RUNS OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN TO THE BASEMENT. THE GHOST REGAINS CONTROL OF MARY AND THROWS DEAN AGAINST THE WALL.


Dean: Mom?


Mary/Ghost: Mommy's gone.


SAM LOOKS AROUND THE BASEMENT. LUCAS APPEARS IN FRONT OF HIM AND POINTS TO WHERE SAM NEEDS TO GO.


DEAN IS STILL FIGHTING THE GHOST POSSESSING MARY. HE ROLLS AWAY AND GRABS THE SHOTGUN AND POINTS IT AT HER.


SAM IN THE BASEMENT, FOUND SOME TOOLS HE CAN USE TO BREAK DOWN THE WALL.


DEAN STILL HOLDING THE SHOTGUN AT MARY.


Dean: Don't. Don't make me.


MARY/GHOST LOOKS AMUSED AND USES ITS POWER TO TOSS THE SHOTGUN OUT OF DEAN'S HANDS


SAM IS KNOCKING DOWN THE BRICKED UP SECTION OF THE BASEMENT


MARY LOOKS AROUND AT THE NOISE SAM IS MAKING IN THE BASEMENT


SAM TEARING MORE OF THE WALL DOWN.


MARY LOOKING PISSED AND STARTING TO TURN TO GO TO THE BASEMENT.


SAM DISCOVERING THE SKELETAL REMAINS OF MORIARTY IN THE WALL


DEAN QUICKLY GRABBING THE CHAIN OFF THE FLOOR AND HOLDING MARY IN THE ROOM


SAM SALTING AND SQUIRTING THE BONES WITH LIGHTER FLUID


MARY STRUGGLING WITH DEAN


Dean: I got you, mom.


SAM LIGHTS THE BONES IN THE WALL ON FIRE


THE GHOST IS THROWN OUT OF MARY WITH A SHOUT AND STARTS SCREAMING AS HE BURNS UP. AS HE BURNS, HE IS SURROUNDED BY THE CHILDREN THAT HE KILLED, WHO WATCH HIM DISAPPEAR. DEAN AND MARY LOOKED SHOCKED. THE GHOST DISAPPEARS JUST AS SAM COMES RUSHING BACK INTO THE ROOM. ALL THREE WATCH IN AWE AS THE CHILDREN LEAVE IN BURSTS OF WHITE LIGHT. LUCAS TURNS FOR ONE LAST LOOK AT MARY BEFORE DISAPPEARING.




OUTSIDE SHOT OF VINCE'S CABIN. CAMERA GOES INSIDE AND PANS AROUND LANDING ON CROWLEY AND CASTIEL COMING IN LOOKING AROUND FOR LUCIFER WHEN THEY HEAR ROWENA'S VOICE. SHE IS SITTING IN A CHAIR ON THE BACK PORCH HAVING A DRINK.


Rowena: If your looking for Lucifer, you JUST missed him.


CASTIEL AND CROWLEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER


Rowena: Cup of tea?


ROWENA, CASTIEL AND CROWLEY ARE WALKING AROUND AND OUT OF THE CABIN.


Rowena: Until you forced me to get back in the game, I'd tried to forget about Lucifer. I loathe him, and I loathe that I had any part in letting him out of the pit he belongs in.


Castiel: So you'll help us, then?


Rowena: Good God, no. That whole FBI pantsuit look? Not my hex bag. But if you get Lucifer cornered and find yourself in need, I'm there.



BACK AT THE BUNKER. CLOSE UP OF JOHN'S JOURNAL, CAMERA PANS UP TO SEE MARY AND DEAN WALKING UP.


Dean: Well, you gonna take a shower? Take a nap? You really went through it today.


Mary: No, I'm okay.


Dean: And, um..listen, apologies if, uh, me and Sam hijacked or sidelined you in any way. I mean, this was your case, you know? And...well, you kicked ass. Again.


Mary: I kicked ass? YOU saved ME. I –


Dean: Yeah, but you were right. You know, those kids WERE innocent. I mean, hell, we didn't even know what Moriarty's deal was.


Mary: I do.


DEAN LOOKS SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS


Mary: When he possessed me, I saw..I felt it. All of it. When Hugo lost his child, he went mad. Buried himself alive in his basement and walled himself in and starved to death.


Dean: Damn.


Mary: But when new families moved in, families with children, he coveted those children. So he took them. Killed them. And somehow that bound their spirits to his. That’s where he got his power. He was so...greedy. Twisted.


Dean: Mom, it's okay. All right? You're home now.


MARY PAUSES AND LOOKS SADDENED.


Mary: No.


DEAN LOOKS CONFUSED AND HURT BY HER WORDS


Mary: I'm not. I miss John. I miss my boys.


SAM WALKS IN AND JOINS DEAN AND MARY


Sam: We're right here, mom.


Mary: I know. In my head. But I'm still mourning them as I knew them. My baby Sam. My little boy Dean. Just feels like yesterday, we were together in heaven, and now...I'm her, and John is gone, and they're gone. And every moment I spend with you reminds me every moment I lost with them.


MARY LOOKS AROUND AT THE BOYS TRYING TO GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND.


Mary: And I thought hunting, working, would clear my head.


Sam: Mom...w-what are you trying to say?


Mary: I have to go.


THE BOYS LOOK HEART-BROKEN BY THIS NEWS.


Mary: I'm sorry. I'm so...so sorry. I just need a little time.


MARY STEPS TOWARDS DEAN, BUT HE BACKS AWAY FROM HER AND CONTINUES LOOKING DOWN. MARY STOPS AND LOOKS AT HIM FOR A MOMENT BEFORE TURNING AND PICKING UP JOHN'S JOURNAL. SHE STEPS UP TO SAM.


Mary: I love you.


SHE HUGS SAM TIGHTLY. THEN TURNS TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT DEAN.


Mary: I love you both.


MARY TURNS AND PUTS JOHN'S JOURNAL IN HER BAG AND THEN STARTS UP THE STAIRS TO THE EXIT. SAM WATCHES HER LEAVE, BUT DEAN REFUSES TO LOOK UP. SAM JUMPS AS THE SOUND OF THE DOOR OPENING ECHOES THROUGH THE BUNKER. EPISODE ENDS WITH CLOSE UP OF DEAN'S FACE.
