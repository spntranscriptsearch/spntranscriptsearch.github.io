NOW
EXT. PARK – NIGHT


Minneapolis, Minnesota


A young male JOGGER is jogging along a path. A HEAVYSET MAN running faster catches up to him, jogs near him for a few moments as they look at each other, then sprints off. The JOGGER stops to catch his breath before jogging on.


Further down the path, the JOGGER comes to a stop in front of the HEAVYSET MAN, who seems to be waiting for him.


JOGGER
[holding out his hand] Congratulations. You're fast.


The HEAVYSET MAN grabs the JOGGER’s outstretched right arm with his left hand.


HEAVYSET MAN
I do a lot of cardio.


The HEAVYSET MAN plunges his right hand into the JOGGER’s chest and withdraws his heart. The JOGGER falls to the ground.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
EXT. FARMERS’ MARKET – DAY


SAM picks up a red apple from a basket and takes a bite. DEAN is looking at his phone.


DEAN
Wow. Guy goes to Purgatory for a year, all hell breaks loose. Check this out. A jogger in Minneapolis gets his heart ripped out.


SAM
I'm guessing literally?


DEAN
Only way that interests me. And then, there's another article from six months ago. [SAM puts tomatoes into a canvas bag.] Same thing happens, also in Minneapolis. What does that tell us?


SAM
Stay out of Minneapolis.


DEAN
Two hearts ganked, same city, six months apart. [SAM hands over money for his purchases.] I mean, that's got to be a ritual, man. Or at least some sort of a heart-sucking, possessed, satanic, crack-whore bat.


SAM
A what?


DEAN
It's a case. Look, I say we hang out the shingle again and ride.


SAM
We're on a case, Dean. Kevin and the demon tablet need to be found, so heart guy takes a number.


DEAN
Uh, we just spent a week chasing our asses trying to lock Kevin down, okay? And look at us. We're – [He looks around at their surroundings.] Where the hell are we?


SAM
[slowly] Farmers' market. [He holds up the apple.] Organic. What? I had a year off. I took the time to enjoy the good things.


DEAN
While avoiding doing what we actually do.


SAM
Wow, Dean, does it make you feel that much better every time you say it?


DEAN
All right, man, look, I get it. You took a year off to do yoga and play the lute, whatever, but I'm back. Okay, we're back, which means that we walk and kill monsters at the same time. We'll find Kevin. But in the meantime, do we ignore stuff like this? Or are innocent people supposed to die so that you can shop for produce?


INT. POLICE STATION – DAY


Someone drops a folder with photos of the dead JOGGER onto a desk. As the camera pans out, we see that DEAN and SAM in suits are talking to a DETECTIVE.


DETECTIVE
Here's what's odd about this thing – the guy wasn't chopped or cut into, no incision. But his heart was ripped out of him like a peach pit.


SAM
Was he robbed?


DETECTIVE
Phone, watch, money all still on him.


DEAN
What about enemies?


DETECTIVE
He was in town for a conference. No local connections.


DEAN
You guys had another one of these about, uh, six months ago?


DETECTIVE
Yeah, and we hit a brick wall. We had nothing to go on, really. Thought maybe we got lucky here. [He walks over to a TV.] A park surveillance camera picked up something.


They watch the HEAVYSET MAN overtake the JOGGER on the security camera footage.


DEAN
Huh. That chubby guy the last person to see the vic alive?


DETECTIVE
Other than the killer. Name's Paul Hayes. We, uh, pulled him in for questioning.


SAM
So what makes you think he's clean?


DETECTIVE
Well, so far, no reason not to. I mean, he said he briefly saw the victim, he ran out ahead, that was it.


DEAN
What, you mean he didn't fall to his knees and confess to gutting the guy?


DETECTIVE
No. I mean we did a thorough check on the guy, not so much as a parking ticket came up. I mean, look at him. I mean, sure, he can run a little bit, but Thor he ain't. You think he's gonna grab Freddy fitness here and throw him down and rip out his heart? I don't think so. Forgive me if I didn't take him out back and shoot him.


SAM
Okay, uh, so... any idea where we can find this guy?


INT. PAUL HAYES’ HOUSE – DAY


PAUL HAYES is mixing a smoothie in a blender as SAM waits.


PAUL HAYES
Sorry. I kind of try to stick to a nutrition and workout schedule. Do you want a hit?


SAM
I'm good. Thanks.


PAUL HAYES
Oh.


SAM
So, Paul, you passed a runner who was later killed. Did you speak with him at all?


PAUL HAYES
Yeah, I went over this with the cops. I-I–I didn't know him. I had never spoken to him. I ran past him. I never saw him again. The end.


A toilet flushes offscreen and DEAN walks into the room


PAUL HAYES
Mm, oh. It's disgusting. It tastes like crap, but it keeps you young.


DEAN
Thanks, uh – uh... too much fiber.


PAUL HAYES
No such thing.


SAM
Thank you. [to DEAN] See? Now, Paul, we couldn't help but notice that the jogger you outraced was a good deal younger than you.


DEAN
Yeah, and less, uh...


PAUL HAYES
Uh, full-figured? You should've seen me before. Yeah, hugging a desk all day and watching TV all night, eating fried everything was killing me. I had a health scare about a year ago.


SAM
I'm sorry to hear that.


PAUL HAYES
No, it changed my life. I mean, I started taking care of myself.


DEAN
Now your body's a temple, huh?


PAUL HAYES
Where I worship every day. [He drinks some of his smoothie.] Ah.


INT. CAFE – DAY


SAM walks through the café and joins DEAN.


SAM
All right, so... what's the word? What did you find poking around at Paul's?


DEAN
Ah, just the usual – condoms, hair gel. No hex bags, nothing satanic, nothing spooky.


DEAN is using a laptop. SAM flips through papers.


SAM
So, he didn't seem like a guy who would be voted most likely to disembowel?


DEAN
No, they never do. [SAM sighs.] Wait a minute. Here's another one.


SAM
What, murder?


DEAN
And a do-it-yourself heart bypass. Two days after this one.


SAM
What part of Minneapolis?


DEAN
The Iowa part. Ames.


SAM
Well, Paul was here being questioned. There's no way that could have been him.


DEAN
This guy was a cop. [DEAN is looking at the Des Moines Herald online. The headline reads “Ames Police Officer Arrested in Murder”.] This is exactly what happened six months ago. Minneapolis, then Ames. Guess you missed that one. I'm just saying.


We see a close-up of the photo in the online article. The description reads “Officer Arthur Swensen, resident of Ames, now in Police Custody.”


INT. AMES POLICE STATION – DAY


OFFICER LEVITT
Arthur Swenson. Real top-shelf officer. 20 years on the force. He'd ordered a pizza, which the vic delivered.


SAM
And then?


OFFICER LEVITT
The vic didn't make his next drop-off. His body was found on the walk in front of Swenson's.


DEAN
And he wasn't wearing a heart?


OFFICER LEVITT
No. Heartless.


SAM
And, uh, what about Swenson?


OFFICER LEVITT
Crumpled on the front stoop. Covered in blood, crying like a baby. Ironically, he had been in court all week, testifying.


A phone rings.


OFFICER
Hey, Levitt, line two.


OFFICER LEVITT
Excuse me. (on phone) Go ahead.


SAM
So that couldn't have been him in Minneapolis.


DEAN
I hate when this happens.


OFFICER LEVITT hangs up the phone.


DEAN
So, this Arthur guy, what does – what does he have to say?


OFFICER LEVITT
Uh... it's not real helpful.


CUT TO: POLICE STATION / JAIL INTERVIEW ROOM


ARTHUR SWENSEN is sitting at a table clasping and unclasping his hands and repeating the same words over and over.


ARTHUR SWENSEN
[repeating] K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy. K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.


DEAN
So, you getting his statement?


SAM
Uh, yeah, k-kind of. Probably not.


DEAN
It's too bad I dropped out of Lunatic 101.


SAM
Whatever it is, it sounds like he's repeating it.


DEAN
Look at his eyes. Hey, Arthur... did you do this alone?


SAM
Arthur, did some invisible voice tell you you had to kill?


ARTHUR SWENSEN bangs his hands on the table.


ARTHUR SWENSEN
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy! [more softly, repeating] K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.


DEAN
Oh, now you've pissed him off. Hey, Art. Can I call you Art? Listen, I'm gonna sprinkle your arm with holy water [He takes out a flask] and it's gonna steam and burn if you're possessed by a demon. [to SAM] He's a mushroom.


DEAN pours holy water on ARTHUR SWENSEN’s arm. Nothing happens.


SAM
Okay, not possessed.


DEAN
Arthur, you want to tell us why you did this?


ARTHUR SWENSEN
[repeating] K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.


DEAN
Okay.


DEAN walks towards the door.


EXT. STORY COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT – NIGHT


INT. STORY COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT – NIGHT


ARTHUR SWENSEN is sitting on the edge of his bed, rocking back and forth and repeating the same words over and over.


ARTHUR SWENSEN
[repeating] K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.


He pulls a metal bar from the bed frame and points it at his eye. The scene shifts to the hallway outside his cell. We hear a stabbing noise and screaming.


ACT TWO
INT. MOTEL – DAY


SAM is playing a recording of ARTHUR SWENSEN repeating “K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.” He and DEAN are still wearing their dress shirts and pants.


SAM
So, what do you think?


DEAN
Personally, I prefer the Keith Richards version.


SAM
Can you actually understand any of the words?


DEAN
If they are words. Sounds like babble to me. Wait a second.


SAM
What?


DEAN
I bought a translation app.


SAM
You bought an app.


DEAN
Yeah. Here, play it.


DEAN holds out his phone and SAM plays the recording again.


DEAN
And babble wins. "Language unknown." [He holds up his phone for SAM to read.]


SAM’s phone rings.


SAM
Mm. (on phone) Agent Sambora. What?


INT. HOSPITAL – DAY


ARTHUR SWENSEN is lying in a hospital bed with a bandage around his head. DEAN is talking to DR KASHI outside the room.


DEAN
So, Dr Kashi, what are we looking at here, some kind of psychotic break?


DR KASHI
Oh, definitely. He was very thorough. Severed the optic nerve. He was determined to remove the eye.


DEAN
And he used, uh, what to cut with?


DR KASHI
He doesn't look strong enough, but he broke off part of the bed frame and used it as a knife. [to a NURSE who handed her a file] Thank you.


DEAN
Wow. They should put warning labels on those beds.


DR KASHI
Like I said – determined.


DEAN
I noticed that he had two different-colored eyes.


DR KASHI
Yes. Apparently, he was in an accident where much of one eye was shattered. His vision was saved with a transplant.


DEAN
When was this?


DR KASHI looks at the file.


DR KASHI
A year ago, almost to the date. And, interestingly, it's the transplanted eye he chose to cut out.


DEAN
Really? Hey, let me ask you something, doc. Is it possible to trace the donor of a transplanted organ?


DR KASHI
Difficult.


DEAN
But possible? [DR KASHI smiles at him.] Hmm.


INT. MOTEL – DAY


SAM is using his laptop on the bed. DEAN enters carrying a drink and take-out food. They are both now in casual clothes.


DEAN
Hey.


SAM
Hey. Arthur Swenson had an eye transplant a year ago, right?


DEAN
Yeah.


SAM
Well, I remembered that Paul Hayes was talking about a health scare he had a year ago that changed his life, so I pulled up his medical records from Minneapolis.


There is a long pause as DEAN looks at SAM.


SAM
You want me on board, I'm on board. Anyways, you want to guess who else, other than Arthur Swenson, had a transplant in the last year?


DEAN
Paul Hayes?


SAM
I gave it away, didn't I?


DEAN
Okay, so we've got two suspects in two identical murders in two different cities that both had organ transplants a year ago.


SAM
Yeah. Also...


DEAN
I love when there's an "also."


SAM
I got to thinking about all that stuff Arthur Swenson was talking about. Maybe your translation app called it "language unknown" because it's a dead language, like ancient Greek or Manx.


DEAN
Manx?


SAM
So I e-mailed an audio file of Arthur's mumbling to Dr Morrison.


DEAN
Who?


SAM
Dr Morrison, the anthropology Professor who helped us out with the Amazons.


DEAN
Yes, okay. Okay. Well, let's get our asses on the road.


SAM
Headed to...?


DEAN
Well, if we are in a repeat of a cycle from six months ago, then, after the murders in Minneapolis and in Ames, the next heart attack was in Boulder, Colorado.


EXT. STRIP CLUB – NIGHT


A MAN is leaning against a wall in an alley outside a strip club. A WOMAN in high platform heels and a tight black dress comes outside.


MAN
Randa?


RANDA
Chick, right?


CHICK
Loved your performance tonight. Must take, uh, must take years of training.


RANDA
[laughs briefly] Actually, uh... I'm kind of a natural.


RANDA takes CHICK’s arm and they walk.


CHICK
Um... You know, I don't normally do this kind of thing.


RANDA
Mm-hmm.


CHICK
Um, there's just… [RANDA pushes CHICK around a corner] …just something about you.


RANDA pushes CHICK against the wall. She pulls his shirt back, bends her knees and presses herself against his body as she straightens up, then plunges a hand into his chest. With her other hand, she puts a finger to his lips.


RANDA
Shh.


RANDA pulls out CHICK’s heart. He drops to the ground.


IMPALA – NIGHT


DEAN is driving and SAM is in the passenger seat.


DEAN
All right, case is coming together. Things are coming together, man. You and me. It is all good. [SAM doesn’t respond.] Hey.


SAM
What?


DEAN
What are you thinking about, organic tomatoes?


SAM
Uh, I'm not thinking about anything.


DEAN
I don't know about you, but this last year has given me a new perspective.


SAM
I hear you. Believe me.


DEAN
I know where I'm at my best, and that is right here, driving down crazy street next to you.


SAM
Makes sense.


DEAN
Yes, it does.


SAM
Or... maybe you don't need me. I mean, maybe you're at your best hacking and slicing your way through all the world's crap alone, not having to explain yourself to anybody.


DEAN
Yeah, that makes sense, seeing as I have so many other brothers I can talk to about this stuff.


SAM
Look, I'm not saying I'm bailing on you. I'm just saying make room for the possibility that we want different things. I mean, I want my time to count for something.


DEAN
So, what we do doesn't count?


DEAN’s phone rings.


DEAN (on phone)
Yeah? Hey, Dr. Kashi. Okay. Thank you. Uh, could you run one more name for me? Yeah – Hayes, Paul. Uh-huh. And the donor? Seriously? How many others? Did anybody from Boulder, Colorado, receive any of those organs? Okay, thank you.


DEAN hangs up.


DEAN
Well, this is gonna singe your axons. She says that both Paul Hayes' kidney and Arthur Swenson's new eye came from – you ready for this? – Brick Holmes.


SAM
You don't mean the Brick Holmes.


DEAN
I do.


SAM
The all-pro quarterback?


DEAN
Indeed. Yeah, the guy played at the top of his game for like a million years, didn't he?


SAM
Yeah, he – he bought it in a car crash last year.


DEAN
Yeah.


SAM
Nose-dived off a bridge or something. He must've signed a donor card. Did the doc say how many organs he donated?


DEAN
Including our two suspects? Eight.


SAM
Eight?


DEAN
Eight.


SAM
Okay, um, and one of them's in Boulder, am I right?


DEAN
You would be wrong. That's the bad news. Good news is, Brick lived just outside of Boulder.


SAM
Well, Brick's dead.


DEAN
Yeah, but he's all we got, so we are going to Boulder.


INT. CANDLELIT ROOM – NIGHT


RANDA dips her fingers into a bowl of blood and paints streaks on her face.


RANDA
K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy. K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy. K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy. K'uhul ajaw, Cacao, shi-jiiy.


RANDA takes a bite of CHICK’s heart. She breathes deeply and closes her eyes as energy seems to shimmer in the room and then enter her body. Her chest glows with red light for few moments. When she opens her eyes, they also glow with red light.


ACT THREE
INT. HOLMES RESIDENCE – DAY


MRS HOLMES is sitting on a sofa. SAM and DEAN are in chairs opposite her.


DEAN
I just want to say how sorry we are for your loss, Mrs. Holmes.


MRS HOLMES
Thank you.


SAM
You know, Brick Holmes was my idol back in high school. Amazing career. Uh, 18 pro seasons, 7 division championships, 4 Super Bowls – never slowed down a day.


MRS HOLMES
Brick lived for competition and athletic perfection. I don't think it occurred to his fans that he was human, like the rest of us.


SAM
Do you know your son was an organ donor?


MRS HOLMES
Does that make this a matter for the FBI?


DEAN
Like we explained earlier, we're mostly here, uh, to dot some I's on a different matter.


MRS HOLMES
There was a public-awareness thing a few years ago. A lot of star athletes signed on. I'm sure Brick didn't think twice about it, since he never thought he was going to die.


DEAN
A lot of jocks are like that, I guess. You know, I-I can't help wonder what happened that night on that bridge. There was light traffic, no alcohol involved, no skid marks. Big-time athlete, reflexes like a cat, how is it that he just drives off the side of a bridge?


MRS HOLMES
When things happen that aren't supposed to happen, they're called accidents, I believe.


SAM
So, everybody knows about Brick's football career, obviously, but no one knows much about his personal life. Was he ever married?


MRS HOLMES
Just to the game. He gave it everything he had. It's a difficult life.


DEAN
Did you notice any changes in Brick before he died – you know, anyone, anything new in his life?


MRS HOLMES
No, no. I don't think so.


DEAN
So, no new interests? Fly fishing, stamp collecting, the occult?


MRS HOLMES
The occult?


DEAN
As a "for instance."


MRS HOLMES
No. Everything was just as it had been. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid my time is up. [She stands up.] The university is naming a new athletic building after Brick. I can't be late.


SAM
Of course. Just one more question.


MRS HOLMES
There is always one more question in life, isn't there? That's what I find. [She heads for the door.]


EXT. HOLMES RESIDENCE – DAY


SAM
Oh, she didn't want to say much, did she?


DEAN
[Checking his phone] Son of a bitch.


SAM
What?


DEAN
There it is. It happened.


SAM
Come on, don't tell me someone had their heart ripped out here in Boulder.


DEAN
All right, then I won't tell you. [He heads for the driver’s door of the IMPALA.]


INT. HOLMES RESIDENCE – DAY


MRS HOLMES watches the IMPALA drive away. She walks to the staircase and looks up to find RANDA standing at the top of the stairs.


MRS HOLMES
What are you doing here, Randa?


RANDA
You know I like to stay close to the mother ship. I saw a car out front, so I came in the back. Cops?


MRS HOLMES
I suppose Brick's death continues to fascinate.


RANDA
So we're clear... You're still being very careful about what you say?


MRS HOLMES
I'm old, Randa, not an idiot.


RANDA
I'm just trying to protect Brick.


MRS HOLMES
And so am I.


RANDA
Brick's heart beats inside here now. Brick gave me new life. I can feel him. It's why I moved to Boulder... to be near here. And I'll watch out for you like Brick did.


MRS HOLMES
I don't need your concern.


RANDA
We need each other, and Brick needs us. You keep our little secret safe, and the three of us will be just fine.


INT. MOTEL – DAY


SAM is sitting on a bed talking on the phone and taking notes. DEAN is using the laptop at the table.


SAM (on phone)
All right, Professor Morrison, that does it. The FBI thanks you. Yes, I am totally looking into adding you as a technical advisor. Yeah, it – it comes with a medical plan. All right, goodbye. [He hangs up.]


DEAN
He come through?


SAM
Yeah, he did. All right, so, here's what crazy Arthur Swenson was babbling over and over. [He takes a seat opposite DEAN at the table.] Um, first, it is a dead language – ancient Mayan.


DEAN
Doesn't get much deader than that.


SAM
So, what Arthur was saying was "The divine god Cacao is born."


DEAN
Cacao?


SAM
Cacao. Yeah, the Mayan God of maize – corn, the big crop. See, Cacao was the most powerful god because maize was the most important thing to the Mayans. Well, that and torturing and killing everyone in sight.


DEAN
So, this is what we're looking for, is a thousand-year-old culture's god of corn?


SAM
Uh, I guess.


DEAN
Well, whatever it is, we better cap it quick, or somebody in Phoenix is next up to get their heart yanked.


SAM
Someone in Phoenix got a piece of Brick?


DEAN
Yeah, I got a name. Just e-mailed the cops.


We see a close-up of The Phoenix Press on the laptop screen. The relevant headline is “Phoenix Police Asking For Public’s Assistance to Find Missing Man.” DEAN zooms in on the article. There is a photo of the missing man with the caption “Missing – Jimmy Tong.”


DEAN
Just heard back from them. They haven't seen the guy in days. Uh, oh, got another e-mail here, too. This one is for you. From a university. Answering questions about admissions.


SAM
Just something I'm looking into. An option.


DEAN
You're seriously talking about hanging it up?


SAM
I'm not talking about anything, Dean. I'm just looking at options. [DEAN stares at him.] So, what, should we just go to Phoenix and chase our tails until this guy shows his face?


DEAN
No. Uh, Brick Holmes is the way into this. [He stands up and walks across the room.] Eleanor Holmes was doing her damndest not to tell us a thing. Nice job on changing the subject, though.


EXT. HOLMES RESIDENCE – NIGHT


INT. HOLMES RESIDENCE – NIGHT


DEAN and SAM walk up the stairs, using flashlights.


DEAN
All right, naming ceremony's over at 10. We got to get in and out.


SAM
Master bedroom.


DEAN
Yeah.


They enter a large bedroom.


DEAN
Closets.


DEAN enters one walk-in closet and SAM another. They turn on the closet lights.


DEAN
Brick's closet. Looks like the stuff hasn't been touched in a year. Man, what this stuff would go for on eBay. [He finds a bottle of peroxide in a drawer.] Hey, Sammy, would it totally crush you to know that your boy Brick wasn't a natural blond?


SAM
Dean, this is really weird.


DEAN
What do you got?


SAM
I don't know. Is this Eleanor's closet?


DEAN
Why would his mother's closet be in here? Are you sure?


SAM takes a jacket and scarf off the hanging rack.


SAM
Check this out. [He steps outside the closet and holds the clothes up for DEAN to see.] This is what she was wearing today when we talked to her.


DEAN
Maybe she moved into Brick's room after he died. Or...


DEAN looks at the bed.


SAM
Oh. Thanks, Dean. Now that image is permanently etched into my retinas.


They go back into their respective closets. DEAN finds another door hidden behind hanging clothes.


DEAN
That's what I'm talking about.


SAM follows DEAN into the hidden room. It is filled with sports trophies and memorabilia.


SAM
Wow. [He pushes past DEAN.] I knew he'd have something like this in his house.


DEAN
This is a lot of hardware. Okay, the football trophies I get, but there's a lot of other stuff here – I mean, baseball, boxing, race-car driving.


SAM
He was a fan. Any kind of athlete – he respected them. I mean, look at all the old stuff he's got – a cricket mallet, golf clubs, a Kendo sword, archery equipment.


DEAN takes a box from a cupboard and opens it.


DEAN
Hey, look at this.


He puts the box down on a table and takes out one of many letters.


CUT TO:


DEAN and SAM are sitting at the table reading the letters.


SAM
They're all the same. "Dearest Betsy..." Blah blah blah. Who's Betsy?


DEAN
I don't know. Girlfriend? Eleanor didn't mention a Betsy.


SAM
This one looks old. Uh, "Dearest Betsy, third day of training camp. Roadwork improving. Working on my left jab. They say this kid Sugar Ray is gonna be tough."


DEAN
Sugar Ray? As in Robinson? Didn't he box in, like, the '40s? Is it signed the same?


SAM
Yeah. "Love, me."


DEAN
Here. "Dearest Betsy, on the road again. So hard to be away from you, honey. Will give the Red Sox hell and get back to you."


SAM
"Dearest Betsy..."


DEAN
"Dearest Betsy, Le Mans will be a bitch this year with all the rain..."


SAM
"...the Phillies are tough, but we're looking to be tougher..."


DEAN
"...them Dodgers will wish they never left Brooklyn..."


SAM
"...looking for my best gal Friday night at the Garden..."


DEAN
"...our o-line hung tough. I had all day back there..."


SAM
"...Alain Prost is a monster in the straightaway..."


DEAN
"Dearest Betsy..."


SAM
"Dearest Betsy..."


DEAN
"Love, me."


SAM
Wait, this one looks recent. "Dearest Betsy... So tired of it all."


INT. MOTEL – NIGHT


SAM is using the laptop at the table. DEAN is reading from a clipboard while sitting on a chair pulled up to one of the beds, which is covered with papers and files.


SAM
Hey. I pulled up the names on those trophies. Check it out.


DEAN moves his chair over to sit next to SAM.


SAM
All right, Brick Holmes – football player. [He brings up photos on the laptop.] Charlie Karnes – race-car driver. Davey Samuelson – baseball player. Kelly Duran – boxer. Four different guys, right?


DEAN
Okay.


SAM
Check this out. [He arranges the photos so that head shots of the four athletes appear on the page.] Same dark eyes, same cheekbones, nose, mouth.


DEAN
Wait, are you saying that these four guys who all look to be in their mid-20s and go back 70 years could be the same guy? Wow. For a 95-year-old, Brick Holmes could take a hit.


ACT FOUR
INT. MOTEL – NIGHT


SAM is typing on the laptop. DEAN is looking at some of the papers that are spread out on the bed.


SAM
So, if all those athletes were the same guy, how'd he pull it off? Appear, then go away and come back with a new look?


DEAN
Cacao, the, uh, the – the maize God – was Mayan, right?


SAM
Yeah.


DEAN
The Maya were all about war and torture and conquest... and sports. It says, "Their athletes were treated like kings.” The Mayan jocks made sacrifices to Cacao by – ready for this? – killing a victim, pulling out his heart, and eating it. They believed the rituals gave them super-charged power over their opponents.


SAM
Yeah, but they didn't stay young forever. So, what? Maybe Brick just made some kind of deal with this Cacao?


DEAN
Well, we've seen it before – people making deals with demons, gods. I mean, maybe he stayed young and strong so long as the sacrifices kept coming. Remember all that antique sports equipment he had? This guy could go back to the Mayan days.


SAM
Wow. So, one of the greatest QBs to ever play the game was over 900 years old.


DEAN
Well, that explains Brick, but what about the mooks carrying his spare parts?


SAM
Maybe the spell went along for the ride and infected the people who got his organs. Remember how Paul Hayes said he had a health scare that changed his life? I mean, maybe the spell could compel him to keep carrying out the ritual.


DEAN
Sort of like getting bit by a werewolf. I mean, once you're infected, you do what you got to do, especially if you like the results.


SAM
Right, except old Arthur, the dedicated cop, couldn't handle it and went nuts. [He sighs.] Brick Holmes, a heart eater. Who knew?


DEAN
Yeah, sorry, buddy. The mighty – they fall hard, huh?


SAM reads something on the laptop.


SAM
Well, at least he wasn't sleeping with his mother.


DEAN
Yeah, good, Sam. Find the silver lining.


SAM
No, seriously. Look.


DEAN moves over to look at the laptop, which shows a photo of a woman with a boxer.


DEAN
"Fighter Kelly Duran is congratulated on a second-round knockout by wife Betsy." "Dearest Betsy."


EXT. HOLMES RESIDENCE – DAY


MRS HOLMES opens the door. SAM and DEAN are on the doorstep in casual clothes.


SAM
Hello, Eleanor.


DEAN
Or would you rather us call you Betsy?


SAM (V-O)
Look, Eleanor, innocent people are dying.


INT. HOLMES RESIDENCE – DAY


SAM and DEAN are in the chairs opposite the sofa as before.


SAM
And they're gonna continue to die until we stop it.


MRS HOLMES sits down on the sofa.


DEAN
Did you know about the murders over the past year?


MRS HOLMES
No. I didn't. I swear. I thought when – when Brick died, it would be over.


DEAN
Help us. Betsy, this is not what you want Brick's legacy to be.


MRS HOLMES
His Mayan name was Inyo. He was a proud young athlete nearly 1,000 years ago. He lived for sport and never wanted his days in the sun to end. So he arranged a bargain with the god Cacao through a high priest.


DEAN
Stay young forever.


MRS HOLMES
As long as the sacrifices continued, twice a year – once for the planting, once for harvest.


SAM
When did you find out about this?


MRS HOLMES
Not until I began to age and – and Brick – Kelly, as he was when I met him – did not. But by that time, Brick himself had changed... inside. He wasn't just the warrior whose only reason for living was combat. He – we were deeply, deeply in love. So in love, I'm ashamed to say, that when I found out that – how my husband stayed young and strong, I chose to ignore it.


SAM
You and Brick had to go underground from time to time to hide your secret, right?


MRS HOLMES
Every ten years or so, he would, uh, re-emerge with a new look, a new name. And me, I was the wife, and I was the woman in hiding, and then, when I got into my forties, I became Brick's mother. Eleanor. I am so tired. You can't imagine the burden of it all. I think even Brick was through. He could see the end of my days were at hand, and... He had lived centuries all alone, but I don't think he could bear the thought of life without me. That's why he drove off that bridge. You must think I'm a monster.


DEAN
No. No, just that you married one. Well, see, here's the deal. Now there are eight killers out there that we have to deal with, not just one.


MRS HOLMES
I don't think so.


SAM
What? Why not?


MRS HOLMES
Brick used to say the heart was key. That was the focus of the sacrifice.


DEAN
Are you saying that if we stop Brick's beating heart, then we could stop the whole thing?


MRS HOLMES nods.


SAM
Do you know where the person is who has the heart? Do you know?


EXT. THE BUNNY HOLE STRIP CLUB – DAY


The IMPALA pulls up. DEAN parks across the street from the strip club.


DEAN
Really? Our king daddy monster is a stripper?


SAM
We're pretty sure this is gonna work, right?


DEAN
Well, as long as Eleanor knows what she's talking about.


DEAN takes a large knife from a bag and hands it to SAM.


SAM
You think Brick thought maybe he'd burn to nothing when he crashed that car?


DEAN
Yeah, but he didn't, which brings us here.


They get out of the IMPALA and walk towards the club.


CUT TO:


SAM and DEAN walk around a corner to the rear door of the club. Neon signs advertise nude dancers, exotic dancers and, pointing to the door, “Rear Entry”. DEAN picks the lock.


INT. THE BUNNY HOLE STRIP CLUB – DAY


Using flashlights, DEAN and SAM walk upstairs and look around the club’s locker room. DEAN inhales.


DEAN
[smiling] Smell that?


SAM
You're gross.


SAM and DEAN walk up more stairs to the main room of the club. The lights come on and RANDA walks out onto the stage.


RANDA
Eleanor sent you, right? I figured she'd probably break and give me up. This won't end well for her, of course. Not that it's gonna end well for you.


SAM takes out the knife.


RANDA
Oh, now, you don't think we're gonna let you do that, do you?


DEAN
"We"?


RANDA raises her eyebrows as two men attack SAM and DEAN from either side. PAUL HAYES punches DEAN into JIMMY TONG.


JIMMY TONG
I'm the guy from Phoenix you were looking for.


JIMMY TONG throws DEAN onto the stage at RANDA’s feet. JIMMY TONG and PAUL HAYES hold down DEAN’s arms.


DEAN
Oh, you guys are stronger than you look.


PAUL HAYES
Comes with the package. Plus, I work out a lot.


RANDA
You can't imagine who I was before. This shy, awkward little thing from Georgia with a heart condition. Then I had the surgery. [She puts a high-heeled foot on DEAN’s chest.] I became freaking Xena, Warrior Princess. [She sits astride DEAN.] I couldn't dissect a frog in high school. But sacrificing to Cacao? [She strokes DEAN’s face.] Better than sex. [She pulls aside DEAN’s overshirt.] So, if I go real slow [she runs a finger over DEAN’s chest] and take my time and enjoy this, I can actually show you your own beating heart before you die.


RANDA presses the fingers of one hand hard into DEAN’s chest, breaking the skin.


DEAN
Aah! Aah! Aah!


SAM smashes a bottle over PAUL HAYES’ head. As SAM and PAUL HAYES grapple, DEAN plunges a knife into RANDA’s stomach. Her eyes and her body around the knife wound burn with red light. JIMMY TONG lets go of DEAN and steps back, and PAUL HAYES and SAM turn to watch RANDA. DEAN gasps in pain. RANDA stands up, her midsection burning with red flames. Milder red light emanates from the chests of JIMMY TONG and PAUL HAYES and they fall to the ground dead. RANDA moans as she continues to burn, then bright white light flares from her midsection, the red light goes out, and she drops to the ground dead. DEAN, still gasping, looks around at SAM, then drops his head back onto the stage.


ACT FIVE
INT. HOLMES RESIDENCE – DAY


DEAN and SAM are standing in MRS HOLMES’ kitchen.


DEAN
Well, we better get going, uh... [He puts down a coffee cup.] We just wanted you to know that it really is over now. [SAM puts down his coffee cup.]


MRS HOLMES
Well, it had to be, one way or the other. I half thought you might fail and Randa would come after me. Either way, I'd finally be at peace.


DEAN
You take care of yourself, Eleanor.


DEAN and SAM leave.


IMPALA – NIGHT


DEAN
Wow. Back in business. Got the win. Admit it – feels good, huh? You know, I was thinking about what Randa said about, uh, you know, what it feels like to be a warrior. I get it, man, I do.


SAM
I know. I know you do. I don't. Not anymore. Hell, maybe I never did.


DEAN
Come on, Sam, don't ruin my buzz, would you?


SAM
Dean, listen, when this is over – when we close up shop on Kevin and the tablet – I'm done. I mean that.


DEAN
No, you don't.


SAM
Dean, the year that I took off, I had something I've never had. A normal life. I mean, I got to see what that felt like. I want that. I had that.


DEAN
I think that's just how you feel right now.


FLASHBACK


EXT. PARK – DAY


SAM is walking across a bridge with the dog from 8.01 We Need to Talk About Kevin.


SAM
Amelia! Amelia, this isn't funny. [He stops in the middle of the bridge and looks around.] Amelia! [The dog runs off.] Riot? Riot!


SAM runs after RIOT and finds him sitting on a picnic blanket with AMELIA.


AMELIA
[raising her arms] Happy birthday!


SAM
What is this?


AMELIA
You've never seen a birthday cake before? Sit. Eat.


IMPALA – NIGHT


The flashback ends. SAM smiles a little at the memory, then glances at DEAN and looks sad.
