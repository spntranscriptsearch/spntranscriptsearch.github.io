TEASER
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

BELA approaches her car, parked by a deserted rural bridge. As she reaches the car, she's startled by a reflection of a figure in the window — it's GORDON WALKER.

BELA
It's rude to sneak up on people.

GORDON
Bela Talbot.

BELA
You have me at a disadvantage. I don't know who you are.

GORDON
Gordon Walker.

BELA
(pause) I've heard of you. Heard you were in prison.

GORDON
Got out.

BELA
Released early on good behavior?

She has opened the car door and casually reaches inside; GORDON holds up a small gun.
GORDON
Looking for this?
(He removes the clip)
I know you were just in Massachusetts, and I know you were with the Winchester boys. Tell me where they are.

BELA
I don't think I know.

GORDON
You don't.
(pulling another, larger handgun on her)
Why don't you think a little harder?

BELA
Put that down. (He doesn't.) What's so pressing about finding the boys, anyway?

GORDON
Sam Winchester's the Antichrist.

BELA
Mmm. I'd heard something about that...

GORDON
It's true.

BELA
... from my good friend, the Easter Bunny, who'd heard it from the Tooth Fairy. Are you off your meds?

GORDON
The world hangs in the balance. So you go ahead and be a smart-ass, but tell me where they are, or I shoot.

BELA
Gordon, you and I don't know each other very well, so let me tell you a little something about me. I don't respond well to threats, but you make me an offer? And I think you'll find me highly cooperative.

GORDON
Okay.
(lowers the gun)
How about...
you tell me where they are,
(raises the gun)
or I kill you right now?

BELA
Kill me. Good luck finding Sam and Dean.

GORDON
(grimacing in frustrating, conceding)
I can wrangle up three grand.

BELA
I don't get out of bed for three grand.

GORDON
You...

As he lowers his arm, BELA sees a small cloth bag hanging at his belt. Her eyes light up.

BELA
Scratch that. Give me the mojo bag, and we'll call it even.

GORDON
Oh, hell no. This thing's a century old. It's...

BELA
Priceless. Believe me, I know. Now, how badly do you want the Winchesters?

GORDON tosses her the bag. BELA pulls out her cell phone and dials.

BELA
Hello, Dean? Hey, where are you?


END TEASER

ACT ONE
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
SAM and DEAN walking quickly through an alley, shining flashlights around. They spot a pool of blood and walk over to it, to find a man lying bleeding but conscious on the ground. He has been bitten in the neck. They crouch over him.

SAM
Hey, hey. Don't worry. We're gonna call you some help, okay?

DEAN
Where is she? Where'd she go?!

The man gestures vaguely down the alley. SAM stays with the man as DEAN runs off in that direction. He stops in the middle of another alley, sees no one. He raises his machete, pulls his sleeve, and slowly draws the machete across his left forearm, drawing blood. He holds the bleeding arm up.

DEAN (yelling)
Smell that?! Come and get it!
(A young woman emerges from a side alley and stares at him; her chin is covered in blood.)
That's right. Come on. I smell good, don't I? I taste even better.
(the vampire approaches cautiously. He holds up the machete, then drops it, luring her in.)
Come on! Free lunch!

The vampire charges; as she grabs him and sinks her teeth into his neck, DEAN whips out a syringe and plunges it into her neck. She convulses and falls to the ground, unconscious.

DEAN (panting)
Whoo!

SAM comes running. He looks at the girl on the ground, and back at DEAN, frowning.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?

DEAN
Ah ... that's just chum in the water. Worked, didn't it?

SAM looks concerned.

DEAN looks down at his arm.

DEAN
Ow.



INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
It is a dingier room than the Winchesters usually occupy; old mattresses line the walls, blocking out all external light. The vampire, whose face is still covered with blood, is tied to a chair in the middle of the room. SAM and DEAN stand over her chair.

She comes to consciousness, and looks around.

DEAN (leaning over her)
You with us?
(she wakes up fully, struggles against her bonds)
Oh, yeah, sorry. You're not going anywhere.

SAM
Where's your nest?
VAMPIRE (looking at SAM in confusion)
What?

DEAN
Your nest... where you and your bloodsucking pals hang out.

VAMPIRE
I don't know what you're talking about. (SAM and DEAN look at each other and roll their eyes.) Please! I don't feel good.

DEAN
Yeah, well, you're gonna feel a hell of a lot worse if we give you another shot of dead man's blood.

VAMPIRE
Just let me go.

SAM
(laughs) Yeah, you know we can't do that.

VAMPIRE
I'm telling you the truth. I'm just... I took something. I'm freaking out! I don't know what's going on!

SAM
You took something?

VAMPIRE
(freaking out)
Yes! I can't... come down. I just want to come down.

SAM
What's your name?

VAMPIRE
Lucy. Please. Just let me go.

SAM
All right, Lucy, how about this? If you tell us what happened, we'll let you go.

LUCY
You will?
(she looks at DEAN, who nods and smiles in a completely insincere way, then shoots SAM a confused look over her head)
Uh, I don't really... um, it's, it's not that clear. I was at Spider.

SAM
Spider?

LUCY
The club, on Jefferson. And there was this guy... he was buying me drinks.

SAM
This guy... what's he look like?

LUCY
He was old, like thirty. He had brown hair, a leather jacket... uh, Deacon or Dixon or something. Said he was a dealer... he had something for me.

DEAN
Something?

LUCY
Something new. "Better than anything you've ever tried." He put a few drops in my drink.

DEAN
Was the drug red and thick?
(she nods. DEAN shoots SAM a look; SAM is shaking his head in disbelief)
Well, genius move there. That was vampire blood he dosed you with.

LUCY
What?

DEAN
Yeah, you just took a big steamin' shot of the nastiest virus out there.

LUCY
You're crazy! He gave me roofies or something! No... The next thing I know, we're at his place, and he says he's gonna get me something to eat, just wait. But I get so hungry.

DEAN
So you busted out?

LUCY
(nods)
But it won't wear off... whatever he gave me?

DEAN
Lights are too bright? Sunshine hurt your skin?

LUCY
Yeah... And smells. And I can... hear blood pumping!

DEAN
Well, I hate to tell you this, sweetheart, but your blood's never pumping again.

LUCY (shakes her head)
Not mine... yours. I can hear a heart beating from half a block away. I just want it to stop.

SAM is looking sympathetic.

DEAN
All right, listen, Wavy Gravy. It's not going to stop. You've already killed two people, almost three.

LUCY
(sobbing) No, I couldn't. No-! I was hallucinating!

DEAN
You killed them, all right? We've been following a sloppy trail of corpses, and it leads straight to you.

LUCY
No. No, it wasn't real! It was the drug! Please! Please, you have to help me!

SAM jerks his head at DEAN, they both step out of the room.
LUCY
No, no.

SAM
(in the next room)
Poor girl.

DEAN
We don't have a choice.

SAM sighs, and shakes his head. DEAN takes his machete back in the room
LUCY
No... please!

She screams and there is a thump. We stay in closeup on SAM'S face as he watches DEAN decapitate LUCY. He flinches.



INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
The man that SAM and DEAN rescued is in a hospital bed, a bandage on his neck and an I.V. in his arm. Two hunters impersonating FBI agents enter: GORDON and KUBRICK.

GORDON
Sir. A few questions about the attack.

MAN
I already talked to the cops.

GORDON
(flashing a badge)
Well, we're not cops. We're FBI.

MAN
FBI?

KUBRICK
Can you describe your attacker?

MAN
Uh .... She was crazy. She had that, uh, super-PCP strength, you know? She GNAWED on my neck.

GORDON
And did she bleed on you?

MAN
On me? No.

GORDON
In your mouth, open wound, anything? You sure about that?
MAN
Yeah, I'm sure. Why do you ask?

GORDON
This woman has a very dangerous virus.

MAN
What? She bit me in the neck!

KUBRICK
The bite doesn't matter. You have to actually ingest the blood to be infected.

MAN
(sighs in relief)

GORDON
Good thing, too. We'd have had to kill you.

(The man laughs nervously but GORDON just stares at him, dead serious.)

GORDON
The attack?

MAN
She jumped me, then bit me. Then those two guys found me and chased her down the alley.

GORDON
What did they look like?

MAN
Ah, I didn't get a good look.

GORDON
Think.

MAN
One of them was real tall.

GORDON turns and gives KUBRICK a darkly significant look.


EXT. BAR (SPIDER) - NIGHT
SAM and DEAN exit Spider, a club with red lights and beautiful young people drinking things. They look frustrated.

DEAN
That was a big, fat waste of time.

SAM
Look, three blondes have gone missing, including Lucy, all last sighted here. I'm telling you, Dean, this is the hunting ground.

Across the way, DEAN sees a 30-something man duck into an alley with his arm around a young blonde.
DEAN
(pointing them out to SAM)
Hey.


EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
In the alley across from the club, the man holds up a dropper full of red liquid, and the girl giggles.
GIRL
You're sick. (laughing)

MAN
You ready, sweetie? One taste of this, you'll never be the same.

He raises the dropper; she opens her mouth and sticks her tongue out to catch the drops. Before any can fall in, DEAN grabs the man's arm, pulls it down, and clocks him in the face. SAM pulls the girl away and shoves her towards the mouth of the alley.

SAM
Get out of here. go! go!

The vampire hurls DEAN into a brick wall, then takes off at a run. SAM goes over and helps DEAN up.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN
(groans)
I'm good. Come on.

They take off after the vampire; as they hurtle around the corner, the vampire is nowhere in sight. But facing them, guns at their sides, are GORDON and KUBRICK. GORDON raises his gun.

END ACT ONE
ACT TWO
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
GORDON and KUBRICK advance, firing freely. SAM and DEAN dive behind parked cars and manage to entirely avoid getting shot. They duck behind a wall and crouch, panting. GORDON and KUBRICK reload.

DEAN
All right. Run. I'll draw them off.

SAM
What?! No, you're crazy!

Ignoring him, DEAN darts out into the line of fire, leaps on top of a car and uses it to get over a second-story parking lot entrance. KUBRICK follows him; GORDON stays behind and heads for where SAM had been hiding. As he rounds a corner, a figure leaps down on him from above, sending him sprawling: it is the VAMPIRE. He kicks GORDON in the face several times and knocks him out.



INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
SAM is pacing alone, worried. DEAN enters.

SAM
There you are!

DEAN
(unconcerned)
Yeah. Sorry, I stopped for a slice.

SAM
Nice move you pulled back there, Dean running right at the weapons!

DEAN
Well, what can I say? I'm a bad-ass.
(he continues to ignore SAM'S worry-face)
So, I guess Gordon's out of jail.

SAM
Uh, yeah, I guess so. You know, how the hell did he know where to find us?

DEAN
(realizing)
That bitch.
(He pulls out his cell phone and dials)
Hi, Bela.

BELA
(on the phone, while driving)
Hello, Dean.

DEAN
Question for you. When you called me yesterday, it wasn't to thank me for saving your ass, was it?

BELA (unabashed)
No. Gordon Walker paid me to tell him where you were.

DEAN
Excuse me?

BELA (laughing)
Well, he had a gun on me. What else was I supposed to do?

DEAN (raising his voice in anger)
I don't know, maybe pick up the phone and tell us that a raging psychopath was dropping by?!!

BELA
Ah. I did fully intend to call, I just got a bit sidetracked.

DEAN
He tried to kill us!

BELA (rolls her eyes)
I'm sorry. i didn't realize it was such big deal. After all, there are two of you and one of him.

DEAN
There were two of them.
BELA (her face falls)
Oh.

DEAN
Bela, if we make it out of this alive, the first thing I'm gonna do is kill you.

BELA
You're not serious.

DEAN
Listen to my voice and tell me if I'm serious.

He hangs up; in her car, BELA looks at her phone a moment and sighs worriedly.


INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
The VAMPIRE'S lair is a dank abandoned storefront with a neon sign outside reading "TRADE CO". Inside, GORDON is tied spread-eagled to a metal bedframe. He painfully regains consciousness. He looks across the room and can see candles, some armchairs, and two young blonde women in bloodstained white shirts strung up in shackles, dangling from their wrists. They move sluggishly. The VAMPIRE enters with a jar of blood.

VAMPIRE
(approaching the first woman and feeding her the blood, which she gulps desperately)
I know you're uncomfortable... but this is just temporary. The hunger will pass, and then you'll feel much better. (He moves onto the second woman and notices GORDON watching him.)
(to GORDON:) You're awake.

GORDON
Who are they?

VAMPIRE
Family.

GORDON
You always keep your family in shackles?

VAMPIRE
We're still getting to know each other. They have just been reborn.

GORDON
You mean you grabbed some poor girls off the street and made them monsters like you.

VAMPIRE
I do what I have to. We're a dying breed. But then, you know that, don't you Gordon? Gordon. Walker. One of the greatest living vampire hunters.

GORDON
In the flesh.

VAMPIRE
You're a big part of why my people are nearly extinct, Gordon.

GORDON (scoffs)
Your "people" are going extinct because you're a bunch of mindless, bloodthirsty animals.

VAMPIRE
(lifts his hand to his lips, sniffing ... blood?)
(laughs briefly)
Right. We're so much more bloodthirsty than you. Hunters slaughtered my entire nest like they were having a party. Murdered my daughter. I can't tell you how satisfying this is... catching a hunter responsible for so many deaths and making you lunch for my new daughters.

The VAMPIRE shows GORDON a print of a sepia-toned photograph or daguerrotype of a woman in pre-20th century garb, presumably his daughter.

GORDON
(scoffing)
"Daughters?" Try "fang whores."

VAMPIRE
Watch your mouth.

GORDON
Oh, did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry. I forgot you're just a misunderstood victim. Even though you murder and spread your filthy disease on pure base instinct. You got less humanity than a sewer rat.

VAMPIRE
I'm sorry you have such a low opinion of my people.

GORDON
Oh, you have no idea.

The VAMPIRE is trembling with anger.

VAMPIRE
(to the blonde new vampires)
Sorry, change of plans. I'll be going out to get your lunch. I've got a better idea for you.

He takes a knife and slices open GORDON'S arm, then his own, and presses the cuts together. GORDON struggles and stares in horror.

GORDON
No! No! No!!
NOOOOO!!!!



INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
DEAN sharpens his machete on a whetstone while SAM cleans a gun beside him.

SAM
That vampire's still out there, Dean.

DEAN
First things first.

SAM
Gordon.

DEAN
About that. When we find him, or if he finds us... Well I'm just saying he's not leaving us a whole lot of options.

SAM
(calmly)
Yeah, I know. We've got to kill him.

DEAN
Really? Just like that? I thought you would have been like,
(mock-whiny voice)
"No, we can't, he's human, it's wrong."

SAM (shrugs)
No, I'm done. I mean, Gordon's not gonna stop until we're dead... or till he is.

DEAN's cell phone rings; he looks at it, scowls, and picks up angrily.

DEAN
What?!

BELA
(on the other end, still driving)
I don't like it when people hold grudges against me, and more to the point, I'd rather you didn't kill me, so I went ahead and found Gordon's exact location for you.

DEAN
You're a hundred miles away. How the hell did you—

BELA
Hello? Purveyor of powerful occult objects? I used a talking board to contact the other side.

DEAN
And?

BELA
Warehouse. Two stories, riverfront, neon sign outside.

DEAN
Thanks.

BELA
One more thing. The spirit had a message for you. "Leave town, run like hell, and whatever you do, don't go after Gordon." For whatever that's worth.

DEAN looks at the phone thoughtfully.



INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
GORDON awakens again; this time he's hanging by his wrists from the ceiling. The following scene is shown from GORDON'S POV as lights and noises become overwhelming. His eyes are bloodshot. He struggles with his chains, ripping them out of the ceiling after a few tries. As he unwinds them from his wrists, the women (also still chained up, but apparently without superstrong vampirism like GORDON got) beg pitifully.

WOMAN
Please... Help us. Please.



EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Cut to: GORDON walking outside. He flinches at every sudden light and sound, stares up at a loudly buzzing, glaringly bright street lamp. He covers his ears in agony as a car passes him, trailing red light behind.

Across the alley he sees a man crouched in front of his car, changing a tire. GORDON struggles with temptation, then staggers over to a window and leans against it, panting. He looks up at his reflection in the glass and bares his teeth; fangs emerge to fill his mouth.

Cut to: The man finishes changing the tire and gets in his car. Before he can start the ignition, GORDON sits up suddenly in the back seat and grabs the man from behind. From outside, we hear the man scream, and see the car shake violently and a spray of blood stain the windshield.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN creep down the steps into the room where GORDON had been held. The bodies of the girls are still hanging, headless, and the VAMPIRE is kneeling in front of them, tears running down his face. DEAN takes a knife from the table and approaches him slowly; he hears DEAN coming but doesn't move.

VAMPIRE
Go ahead. Do it. KILL me.

SAM
What happened here?

VAMPIRE
Gordon Walker. I never should have brought a hunter here. Never. I just... I just wanted some kind of revenge. Stupid... exposing him to my family.

DEAN
Oh, yeah, you're such a family man.

VAMPIRE
(pause)
You don't understand.

DEAN
I don't want to understand, you son of—

VAMPIRE
I was desperate! You ever felt desperate? (shot of DEAN's face) I've lost everyone I ever loved. I'm staring down eternity alone. (shot of DEAN's face) Can you think of a worse hell?

DEAN
Well, there's Hell.

VAMPIRE
I wasn't thinking. I just ... I didn't care anymore. Do you know it's like when you just don't give a damn? It's like ... it's like being dead already. So just go ahead. (looks down at DEAN's knife) Do it.

SAM
(inspecting the headless bodies)
Dean. Head wasn't cut off, it was ripped off. With someone's bare hands. Dixon, what did you do to Gordon?



INT. KUBRICK'S MOTOR HOME - NIGHT
KUBRICK hears a noise, pulls back the curtains to look outside. When he turns around again, GORDON is there, staring at him.

KUBRICK
(cautiously)
Gordon. You okay?

GORDON
Not even close.

KUBRICK
I thought maybe you were dead. (GORDON scoffs.) What is it?

GORDON
Something ... happened.

KUBRICK
What?

GORDON
They turned me.

KUBRICK
'They' those fangs? (pause) I'm sorry. You know what this means.

GORDON
It means you have to kill me.
(grabbing him by the shoulders)
But not yet.

KUBRICK
What do you mean?

GORDON
You have to let me do one last thing first

KUBRICK
What?

GORDON
Kill Sam Winchester.

KUBRICK
Gordon...

GORDON
It's the only... it is the one good thing to come out of this nightmare. I'm stronger, I'm faster – I can finish him.

KUBRICK
Gordon ... I'm sorry. You know I can't let you walk out of here.

GORDON
Listen to me. There is nothing more important. Please. (pause, GORDON walks and faces the crucifix) I can do one last good thing for the world.

GORDON is facing the crucifix on the wall; behind him, out of sight, KUBRICK carefully reaches for his machete. GORDON hears KUBRICK'S heart rate increase.

KUBRICK
Yeah. I hear you. You know, Gordon, you're right. One last good thing.

KUBRICK approaches with the blade, and at the last moment GORDON turns, driving his hand into KUBRICK'S guts. He pulls his gory hand out and stares at it; KUBRICK slumps forward onto his shoulder.

GORDON
(whispered)
I'm sorry.



INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
DEAN enters the room, frustrated, and removes his jacket. SAM is seated at the table, poring over maps.

DEAN
Man, I must have checked three dozen motels, empty buildings, warehouses ...

SAM
Yeah, me too. Big city.

DEAN
(washing his face in the sink)
It's like a giant haystack, and Gordon's a deadly needle. We're running out of daylight. Won't have the sun slowing him down.

SAM
Yeah, he'll be unstoppable. Hey, uh, give me your phone.

DEAN
What for?

SAM
(pulling out the SIM cards from his and DEAN's phones)
Well, if Gordon knows our cell numbers he can use the cell signal to track us down.

DEAN
Oh, yeah. (hands phone over) Thanks.

SAM stomps on both phones as DEAN looks out the curtains. DEAN walks back with a sense of purpose.

DEAN
Sammy, stay here.

SAM
What? Where you going now?

DEAN
(pulling the COLT out of his bag and checking it)
I'm going after Gordon.

SAM
What?

DEAN
You heard me.

SAM
Not alone, you're not.

DEAN
Sam, I don't need you to sign me a permission slip, okay? He's after you, not me, and he's turbocharged. I want you to stay out of harm's way. I'll take care of it.

SAM
Well, Dean, you're not going by yourself. You're gonna get yourself killed!

DEAN
Just another day at the office. It's a massively dangerous day at the office (smirking)

SAM
So you're the guy with nothing to lose now, huh? Oh wait, let me guess. Because, uh, it's because you're already dead, right?

DEAN
If the shoe fits.

SAM
You know what, man? I'm sick and tired of your kamikaze trip

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, kamikaze? I'm more like a ninja.

SAM
That's not funny.

DEAN
It's a little funny.

SAM
No. It's not.

DEAN
What do you want me to do, Sam, huh? Sit around all day writing sad poems about how I'm gonna die? You know what? I got one. Let's see, what rhymes with "shut up, Sam"?

SAM
Dude, drop the attitude, Dean. Quit turning everything into a punch line. And you know something else? Stop trying to act like you're not afraid

DEAN
I'm not!

SAM
You're lying. And you may as well drop it 'cause I can see right through you.

DEAN
You got no idea what you're talking about.

SAM
Yeah, I do. You're scared, Dean. You're scared because your year is running out, and you're still going to Hell, and you're freaked.

DEAN
And how do you know that?

SAM
Because I know you!

DEAN
Really?

SAM
Yeah, I've been following you around my entire life! I mean, I've been looking up to you since I was four, Dean. Studying you, trying to be just like my big brother. So yeah, I know you. Better than anyone else in the entire world. And this is exactly how you act when you're terrified. And, I mean, I can't blame you. It's just... (pause)

DEAN
What?

SAM
I wish you would drop the show and be my brother again. 'Cause... (can't find words; tears in his eyes) just 'cause.

DEAN
(after a pause)
All right, we'll hole up, cover our scent so he can't track us, and wait the night out here.



LATER, DEAN barricades the doors and windows as SAM lights a bundle of sage.

DEAN's phone rings.

SAM
You've had that phone two hours, Dean. Who'd you give the number to?

DEAN
Nobody.
(picks up)
Hello?

GORDON
Dean.

DEAN
How'd you get this number?

GORDON
Your scent's all over the cellphone store. Of course, I can't smell you now. Where are you?

DEAN
Well, I guess you'll just have to find us, won't you.

GORDON
I'd rather you come to me

DEAN
What's the matter, Gordo? You're not afraid of us, are you? We're just sitting here. Bring it on!

GORDON
I don't think so.

He holds the phone in front of a WOMAN who is his hostage.

WOMAN crying.
Please. Please.

GORDON
(taking the phone back and shushing her)
Factory on riverside off the turnpike. Be here in 20 minutes or the girl dies.

DEAN
Gordon, let the girl go.

GORDON
Bye, Dean.

DEAN
Gordon! Don't do this. You don't kill innocent people. You're still a hunter.

GORDON
No. I'm a monster.

END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

DEAN and SAM find the hostage and untie her.

SAM
Hey, we got you. Don't worry. We're gonna get you out of here.
(SAM helps her up)
Get up. Watch your head. Watch your head.

The woman is sobbing and can barely walk, so DEAN slings her arm over his shoulders and picks her up.

DEAN
Sam, stay close.
SAM follows DEAN and the woman closely, but not closely enough: a mechanized door suddenly slides down in front of SAM, cutting him off from the others.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM and DEAN both pound and kick at the door, to no avail.

SAM
Dean!

DEAN
Damn it, Sam!

SAM pounds the door one last time in frustration, then turns and walks away from it, eyes darting around.

DEAN (from the other side of the door)
Sam, be careful!

The lights go out. SAM freezes, brings his machete up, and starts creeping around with his other arm held out blindly.

SAM
Gordon! You got me where you want me. You might as well come out and fight!

GORDON
(appearing behind him)
I'm right here, Sam. (SAM swings his machete; it swishes through the air and doesn't make contact. GORDON chuckles) What's the matter, Sammy?

SAM
So, this is really the way you want to do it, huh?

GORDON
Damn right I do.

We see SAM through GORDON's infrared vision, as SAM feels his way around the room, in what is total darkness for SAM.

GORDON (continuing)
You have no idea what I faced to get here. I lost everything. My life. But it's worth it, 'cause I'm finally gonna kill the most dangerous thing I ever hunted. You're not human, Sam.

SAM
Look who's talking.

GORDON
You're right. I'm a bloodthirsty killer.

GORDON continues to stalk SAM, SAM whirling about in the dark, GORDON using his infrared vision.

SAM
Don't talk about it like you don't have a choice.

GORDON
I don't.

SAM
Yes you do, Gordon. You didn't kill that girl.

GORDON
No, I didn't. I did something much, much worse.



MEANWHILE, on the other side of the door DEAN is still hacking away. As he tosses the tool away in frustration, the girl vamps out and attacks, knocking him to the ground. DEAN digs in his pocket and pulls out the COLT, and fires a single bullet into her forehead. She convulses, energy crackling, and slumps to the floor.



MEANWHILE, SAM is still feeling around blindly as GORDON taunts him.

GORDON
I got to hand it to you, Sam. You got a lot of people fooled. But see, I know the truth. I know what it's like. We're the same now, you and me. I know how it is walking around with something evil inside you. It's just too bad you won't do the right thing and kill yourself. I'm gonna ... as soon as I'm done with you. Two last good deeds. Killing you, and killing myself.

While GORDON has been talking, SAM has been backing into a corner, facing GORDON.

GORDON attacks, sending them both flying through the wall separating them from DEAN. The impact briefly knocks the machete out of SAM's hand. SAM picks it up again, as GORDON picks SAM and flings him across the room. DEAN comes up from behind and points the COLT at GORDON'S head, but GORDON is too fast for him; he grabs DEAN'S gun-arm, flings him across the room, then pins him against the wall and sinks his teeth into DEAN'S neck. SAM picks himself up in time to see this.

SAM
No!

SAM charges GORDON and clocks him across the back of the neck. GORDON turns away from DEAN and knocks SAM down, then slams him across a worktable. SAM manages to grab a piece of cloth and an end of razor wire in each hand; as GORDON pins him down again SAM wraps the razor wire around GORDON'S neck and pulls. GORDON begins to choke out a death-rattle, and SAM glares, grits his teeth and pulls harder. Blood drips from his hands where the razor wire is cutting in, and yet he pulls harder, until he cuts all the way through GORDON'S neck and sends his head tumbling. He pants from the effort, stares down at GORDON'S head on the ground, and examines his bloody hands.

DEAN staggers to his feet, groaning and coughing and clutching his neck in pain. He's still holding the COLT. He looks down in surprise at the headless GORDON, then back up at SAM, who shrugs. They stumble off together, neither of them moving very well.

DEAN
You just charged a super-vamped-out Gordon with no weapon. That's a little reckless, don't you think?

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT. TWO-LANE BLACKTOP – DAY

DEAN is under the hood of the IMPALA, poking at something. SAM opens a cooler and pulls out two beers, then shuts the lid and sits on it. He opens one bottle and passes it to DEAN. Stereo is playing BAD COMPANY's "Crazy Circles".

SAM
Here you go.

DEAN
Thanks.

SAM
Figure out what's making that rattle?

DEAN
Not yet. Give me a box wrench, would you?

SAM
Yeah. There you go.

DEAN
Thanks.
(he takes the wrench, then looks thoughtful.
Sam.

SAM
Wrong one?

DEAN
No no no, come here for a second.

SAM
(gets up and leans over the hood with DEAN.
Yeah.

DEAN
(gesturing)
This rattle could be a couple of things. I'm thinking it's an out-of-tune carb.

SAM
(confused)
Okay.

DEAN
All right, see this thing? It's a valve cover. Inside are all the parts that are on the head. Hand me that socket wrench.
(SAM does)
All right, you with me so far?

SAM
Yeah, uh, valve cover covers the heads.

DEAN
Very good. Now this is your intake manifold, okay, and on top of it?
(pauses)

SAM
(smiling, trying to remember)
It's, uh, uh, a carburetor.

DEAN
Carburetor.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Very good.

SAM
What's with the auto shop?
(Dean holds out the socket wrench)
What, you don't mean you want—

DEAN
Yeah, I do. You fix it.

SAM
Dean, you barely let me drive this thing.

DEAN
Well, it's time. You should know how to fix it. You're gonna need to know these things for the future. (They look at each other.) And besides, that's my job, right? Show my little brother the ropes?

SAM nods and takes the wrench, swallowing with some emotion, and leans in and starts unscrewing. DEAN sits on the cooler and turns slightly to watch SAM.

DEAN
Put your shoulder into it.
