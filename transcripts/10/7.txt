TEASER
[The scene opens on a dark alley, a drunk lying on the ground drinking out of a bottle in a brown paper bag. A woman - Tiana - runs into the alley. As she turns a corner she stops, looks behind her and sees a shadow on the building across the street She resumes running, breaks a heel on her boot and falls to the ground.]
WOMAN

Ow!

[She grabs her broken heel, resumes running, turns another corner and runs into a man dressed in black.]

TIANA

Raul

MAN

You better think fast, Tiana,'cause this looks bad.

TIANA

I'm sor--I'll do anything. I'll come back. I'll make it up to you. Just please don't hurt me.

[Raul moves in and runs a finger down Tiana’s lips]

RAUL

Now… What kind of message would that send the other girls, huh?

[Tiana places her broken heel between her fingers like a spike and stabs Raul in the eye with it]

RAUL

Aah!!

[Raul covers his eye]

[Tiana pulls out the heel and it is covered in blood and eye ‘goop’. Raul pulls his hand away from his eye and smiles]

Oh, Tiana, Tiana. I'd say I'm sorry to lose you, but...

[Raul places his hands on Tiana’s face…]

There's plenty more where you came from.

[and snaps her neck]

ACT ONE
[The scene opens in a restaurant. The camera is looking over Sam’s shoulder and we see Dean looking at his phone and eating French fries with a fork. The camera pulls back to show Sam reading a paper]

SAM

What? This? Um, cattle deaths a few towns over? A demon possibility or something?

DEAN

No, it says right there. It's probably just 'cause of the drought.

SAM

So, what are we doing here?

[Dean looks at Sam’s plate and points to it with his fork]

DEAN

Uh, reason's right on your plate. Lizardo's porterhouse --U.S.D.A. prime.

[Cell phone chiming]

It's the only place between Connecticut and the bunker you can get a decent steak under 10 bucks.

[Cell phone chiming]

SAM

[Sam leans over to look towards Dean’s cell phone.]

Dude, you are blowing up. Who is that?

DEAN

[Dean is scrolling on his phone]

Ah, it's just, uh, you know, these alert thingies.

SAM

For what?

DEAN

You know, monster...stuff.

[Sam nods his head, smirks and grabs Dean’s cell phone]

Hey, hey. Unh-unh. No. Give it back.

SAM

[Sam hold Deans’ cell phone against his chest]

What? Wh-why?

DEAN

Because privacy...And stuff.

SAM

Oh, priv—

[Sam looks down at cell phone. We see Sam’s view of Dean’s phone-A picture of Dean with the caption ‘Impala67’ and Dean’s status information:

Dean Winchester

Age: 35 Years old

Location: Lebanon, Kansas Unites States

Seeking: Woman

Status: Never Married

About: Rolling through (can’t see if this says anything more)

No strings attached]

SAM

You're on a dating app?

DEAN

Yeah, and you know what? Don't knock it until you try it.

SAM

Nice screen name, Dean --

{Deep Voice] Impala67.

DEAN

[Dean reaches for the phone]

All right, give it back. Come on.

SAM

Shaylene, huh?

Dean, there are like a million messages here.

DEAN

Yeah, uh, check out her pic.

SAM

Uh...Oh. Wow. Okay.

[Camera view of phone shows a beautiful woman with dark hair in a blue dress]

Um, okay. She's hot. But...

DEAN

"But," what?

SAM

But she seems, um... Kind of...available. Like too available. "Oh, baby, whatever you want. I'm burning up just thinking about you."

DEAN

They get raunchier.

SAM

Yeah. Yeah, I -- I see that. It's like a, uh --like a Penthouse letter.

DEAN

Yeah. Is that bad?

SAM

No, it's not bad, Dean. It's too good to be true.

DEAN

I'm sorry, is it --is it so hard to believe that an attractive, red-blooded, American female could be interested in someone like me?

SAM

You realize there's no guarantee "Shaylene" is even Shaylene. I mean, for all you know, it could be some...

Canadian trucker n-named Bruce.

[Sam gets distracted by something behind Dean. Camera pans around to show “Shaylene” in a purple dress smiling at Dean]

DEAN

[Dean looks over his shoulder and smiles. He waves at Shaylene and she waves back. Dean turns to Sam]

That look like a Bruce to you?

[Dean starts to get up from his chair]

SAM

We -- we detoured eight hours so you could get laid?

DEAN

Yeah. Yeah. Oh, and, uh, you know what? Lunch is on me.

[Dean takes some bills out of his wallet and puts them on the table]

And, uh...don't wait up.

[Dean walks over to Shaylene who appears to be talking with another woman and puts his arm around her waist.]

DEAN

Excuse me. Hi.

SHAYLENE

Hey.

{Dean and Shaylene turn to walk out of the restaurant. Dean looks over his shoulder and smiles at Sam. Sam ‘checks her out’ as they leave]

ACT TWO
[Scene changes to a wall covered with a large map. There are photographs of faces pinned to the map. Some of them have ‘X’s’ through them. We see Hannah pin up another picture of a man and then place a large ‘X’ through his face with a red Sharpie marker.

Camera turns to Castiel sitting on the bed (in what is now revealed to be a hotel room) behind Hannah with a laptop on his lap. The camera turns so we see the web page ‘Websummon’ and the search string ‘Tennessee, miracles’. The mouse hovers over the first entry ‘Why Pastor Chris Miracles May Be Fake’.

HANNAH

It's getting easier.

[Castiel clicks on the link and opens to a the page ‘NEWS WebNET’ with the headline ‘Local Pastor Christopher Sherman Works Miracles in His Parish’]

HANNAH

Isaac came back willingly --didn't even resist. There are still some angels down here, but the higher-profile rogues

are back.

CASTIEL

We find them all --that's the mission.

[Castiel gets up and brings the laptop over to Hannah and shows her the page]

CASTIEL

Here. Christopher Sherman --pastor. Local paper in Tennessee says he's working miracles in his Parish.

HANNAH

Figure of speech?

CASTIEL

Perhaps.

[Hannah walks away as Castiel looks at the pictures on the wall. As she’s walking Hannah removes her suit jacket and hangs it on a hook on the wall]

CASTIEL

The best lead we have. Until we find something stronger, we should...

[Hannah is undressing as Castiel talks. As he turns back to face her she drops her shirt. The camera view is from behind Hannah so we see her naked back and Castiel facing her from across the room with a surprised look on his face

CASTIEL

...uh...check it out.

[Castiel is trying to NOT look at Hannah]

CASTIEL

Hannah?

HANNAH

Yes?

CASTIEL

What are you doing?

HANNAH

I'm taking a shower.

CASTIEL

Um...We don't need to shower.

HANNAH

I know.

[Hannah looks confused by Castiel’s reaction]

Are you --Does this bother you?

CASTIEL

Bothered? I...I'm not.

HANNAH

[Hannah smirks]

Good.

[Hannah turns to enter the bathroom. A door closes and we hear water running].

[Scene changes to the Impala parked outside a motel.]

[Scene changes to Dean being slammed up against the motel room wall. Shaylene moves in and talks off Dean’s button down shirt. Heavy kissing and panting]

SHAYLENE

I forgot something. We still need to discuss my terms.

DEAN

Oh, like, rules? Like, sexy rules?

SHAYLENE

Um, more an issue of payment.

DEAN

Oh.

SHAYLENE

Yeah.

[Shaylene moves away from Dean and turns her back to him]

Sweetie [laughs] thought you figured it out. I mean, shy of coming out and saying it, I thought I made it pretty obvious.

DEAN

Yeah, yeah, no. I-I just, uh... See, I have this code. Uh, "No cash for ass."

SHAYLENE

[Shayene faces Dean]

Oh, well you're in luck, honey, 'cause I don't want your money.

[Shaylene walks back to Dean and leans into his chest]

All I want from you is one little thing --a trifle, really.

DEAN

I'm listening.

SHAYLENE

Your soul.

DEAN

My soul?

SHAYLENE

[Laughs] It's nothing, baby. Who knows what a soul is, really,

[Dean rolls his eyes]

if it even exists? All I know is you say yes, my guy comes up, you sign some papers, and then it's you and me --good to go.

DEAN

Mm.

[Dean moves away from the wall and Shaylene]

So that's it?

[Dean has his back to Shaylene and is looking around the motel room as if looking for something]

Just...sign over my life.

SHAYLENE

It's a signature, baby.

[Dean turns to face Shaylene. Shaylene is now leaning against the motel room wall in a sensual manner]

What's a little paperwork compared to absolute physical bliss?

DEAN

Well, you make a strong case.

SHAYLENE

I love my job.

DEAN

Do you?

SHAYLENE

[Shaylene looks nervous]

Yeah.

DEAN

'Cause it doesn't look like love to me.

[Shaylene clears her throat.]

[Scene changes to Hannah and Castiel walking through the motel restaurant]

HANNAH

Get the car. I'll check us out.

{Hannah opens her wallet. We see her driver’s license as she pulls out a credit card. As she places it down on the hotel desk a hand comes across and grabs her hand. Hannah turns around with surprised look on her face.]

MAN

Caroline.

HANNAH

Uh...

MAN

I -- I put an alert on your credit card. Saw a charge here. I drove all night.

[Camera turns to Hannah who looks upset]

[Scene changes to a man entering Dean and Shaylene’s hotel room.]

MAN

How we doing?

[Dean and Shaylene are sitting on opposite corners of the hotel bed, backs to each other]

MAN

Everybody ready for a good time?

[Man walks further into the room and pulls a blue paper out of his jacket pocket]

MAN

Okay. John Hancock right here. Then we can get this party started.

[Dean stands up and faces the man as Sam walks into the room and stands next to Dean, who has an Angel blade in his hands)

MAN

Winchesters.

[Sam and Dean look up towards the ceiling. The man looks up also and sees a red Devil’s Trap painted on the ceiling directly over him.]

DEAN

She told us everything.

SAM

Abduction, forced prostitution -- it's pretty gnarly, even for a demon.

MAN

She's got her version, I've got mine.

SHAYLENE

Liar.

DEAN

Let me guess --she came to you begging for you to pimp her out.

MAN Yeah, 'cause that Harvard degree was working out so well for her.

DEAN

How many girls are there, hmm? How big is this?

MAN

Just me and Shay.

SHAYLENE

He's lying. There's a brothel. I heard him on the phone. They told me what you are -- a demon from hell.

MAN

Beats trash from the street. Face it, Missy -- without me, you would've been dead of drugs or worse in a year. Frankly, this little ho should be thanking me.

[Shaylene grabs the demon blade from Dean, jumps up from the bed and stabs the man (demon).]

DEAN

Whoa!

[The demon dies in typical manner and falls to the floor]

DEAN

Okay. Well, that just happened.

SAM

Yeah, and he was our best shot at the location of the brothel. Do you have any idea where it is?

SHAYLENE

No, but, um...

[Shaylene goes to the dead demon, reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a business card and hands it to Dean]

I saw him give these out at the bars.

[We see the card-‘Raul’s Girls-1482 Willis Blvd.’]

[Scene changes to the inside of a bar. A man is holding a skimpy outfit on his hand]

MAN

What did you say?

[Camera turns to CAITLIN – Caitlin - sitting in a chair]

CAITLIN

I said, "If you like it so much, why don't you wear it?"

[Raul (wearing an eye patch) enters from door behind ‘man’]

MAN

She won't wear the clothes you picked. What should I do?

RAUL

Gerald, what do you think? Don't leave any marks.

[Gerald turns to girl and smiles creepily. The door to the bar opens and a woman with red hair, in a black dress walks in (she is the woman from the end of 10.03 Soul Survivor - ROWENA)]

GERALD

Hey, lady, I think you're in the wrong place.

ROWENA

[Speaking with a Scottish accent]

This is Raul's girls, isn't it? Clever name, by the way.

RAUL

Sorry, but we're not hiring at the moment. And, no offense, but even if we were, you're a little...old. Unless you're here as a customer.

ROWENA

No disrespect to your girls, but I'd sooner die than do business of any kind with filth like you.

[Rowena throws a hex bag with red markings to Raul, who catches it.]

RAUL

You.

[Raul starts gasping and groaning, black goop comes pouring out of his mouth. As he collapse to the floor we see a blonde woman – Elle - come in from the other side of the bar area, behind Gerald]

GERALD

Boss?

ROWENA

Ladies, you may want to stand back. This will get messy.

[Black smoke pours out of Gerald’s mouth and exits through the air vent while Raul continues to vomit black goop on the floor. He falls to his back, convulses and dies]

ROWENA

Hardly the most appetizing process in the world, but killing demons always makes me hungry.

[Woman turns her back to the women and then looks over her shoulder to them]

You coming? I mean, you're welcome to stay here.

[Caitlin and Elle, looking horrified, look at each other, nod their heads and leave with the woman]

ROWENA

Fabulous!

ACT THREE
[Scene opens on Hannah and the man from the hotel lobby, now in a hotel room]

MAN

Caroline, you've been gone a year. Disappeared.

I don't know what's happened to you, I don't know who's gotten into your head, but something's going on, and I'm not walking away till I know what.

HANNAH

Well, there is a reason, an answer for all of this.

MAN

Th-then tell me.

HANNAH

I can't. You wouldn't understand.

MAN

Then I'm not going anywhere.

[Man sits on the bad as Castiel enters the hotel room]

CASTIEL

I waited at the car, but the desk man said --

HANNAH

Castiel. This is Joe...my husband.

CASTIEL

Oh? [looking puzzled]

Oh.

JOE

Who is this guy?

HANNAH

He...Uh...

JOE

You saying you're...together?

HANNAH

What? Yes. [Hannah takes Castiel’s hand in hers] I left you. For him. He's the reason.

JOE

No. No, I don't believe it. This guy? You? No, there's something... You're not that kind of person, okay? You wouldn't do that. You couldn't do that.

[Hannah turns and kisses Castiel passionately. As the break apart we see Joe, looking devastated. Hannah and Castiel look at each other]

HANNAH

[To Joe] I'm sorry.

[To Castiel] Let's go.

[Hannah and Castiel leave the room]

[Scene changes back to the bar. We see Gerald (dead/unconscious) on the floor and Raul laying in a puddle of black goop]

DEAN

Can't believe somebody got to kill this Raul tool before we could. Check I.D.s.

SAM

All right.

[Sam kneels down by the bodies while Dean goes behind the bar and pours himself a drink]

Uh, Dean, from the look and...smell of it, pure demon. I think this is Raul.

DEAN

What? Did he puke himself to death?

SAM

Yeah, literally.

DEAN

Okay, so... Something went down here. There was a standoff. One demon smokes out and Raul... What can even kill a demon like this?

SAM

Apparently...

[Sam reaches by Raul’s hand and picks up the hex bag]

A witch.

[Scene changes to woman drinking champagne and sitting with WOMANs in an upscale restaurant. French music is playing in the background]

ELLE

Uh, ma'am, why are we here?

ROWENA

I thought you'd be hungry. I doubt that swine Raul fed you properly.

CAITLIN

Yeah, but... We don't belong here.

[Waiter walks up to the table]

WAITER 1

Apologies for the interruption, ma'am.

ROWENA

That word again.

WAITER 1

But I'm afraid that the bistro des moules has a very strict dress code, a sartorial standard certain members of your party fall well short of.

CAITLIN

Now can we go?

WOMAN

Stay in your seats. We're not going anywhere.

[Woman turns to reach into her bag]

WAITER 1

Excuse me?

ROWENA

You heard me

[Woman hands the waiter a small hex bag]

[to Waiter] Famalatus

[Scene changes to plates of food being laid on the table. Camera pulls back and we see a line of waiters coming to the table with plates of food and drinks]

WAITER 1

A Krug '95 -- an excellent vintage. With our compliments, of course.

ELLE

This is awesome.

CAITLIN

How did you do it?

ROWENA

Magic.

[Scene changes to Crowley sitting on his throne.]

Gerald...

[Crowley gets up and walks toward ‘Gerald’ who is now a construction worker]

A bordello? You opened a whorehouse in my name?

GERALD

Well, technically, the place was called Raul's girls, but...Yes. Look, Raul said that --

CROWLEY

Oh, Raul said?

GERALD

Your decree last month -- soul deals way down after the war with Abaddon. Said that you were looking for proactive and out-of-the-box strategies to get numbers back up.

CROWLEY

So, you and your half-wit pal threw me into the sex trade? I'm evil. That's just tacky.

GERALD

We tried running it past you, but we were told you weren't taking meetings, that you were distracted. I mean, busy. Look, this witch took Raul down like that. Whole operation -- kaput. I smoked out.

CROWELY

Ran away.

GERALD

Possessed the nearest meatsuit I could find.

CROWLEY

Apparently so.

GERALD

Because I thought that you should know what happened. Act of aggression like that didn't seem like something you could let stand.

CROWLEY

[Rolling his eyes] Hmm.

[Scene changes Sam and Dean driving in the Impala at night]

SAM

Here we go.

[We see Sam’s laptop open to a page ‘Witchcraft and the Occult…To Bind and Purge]

Um, so it looks like in the 18th century, there were accounts of demons killed by witchcraft. Apparently they were vanquished by a spell called defigere et depurgare which is Latin for "to bind and purge."

DEAN

You think that's the same kind of spell that took out Raul?

SAM

Sounds like it. But from what I can tell, that spell hasn't been used in over 300 years. And it was only ever known by one person, the witch who created it.

DEAN

That is?

SAM

Rowena.

[Scene changes back to Rowena and the women in the restaurant]

ROWENA

According to the grand coven, there are three recognized kinds of witch in the world. Most common are the borrowers -- those who harness the power of a demon in order to practice the art. Owing to recent experience, I doubt you'd have the stomach for that.

Secondly, and rarest of all, are the naturals -- those who are... Born with the gift.

ELLE

You're one of those.

ROWENA

Well you are correct.

CAITLIN

And what's the third?

ROWENA

The students -- those with no natural ability who, with enough practice and training and a grand coven-approved mentor to show them the path, can eke out a modicum of witchly power.

ELLE

Will... You be our mentor?

ROWENA

Well...I'm about as far from grand-coven-approvedas it's possible to be. They threw me out many years ago. Disapproved of my methods. Said my magic was too extreme. I was forbidden from using magic, from taking students, from forming a coven. I've been on the run from those utter fannies ever since.

CAITLIN

So, you can't teach us?

ROWENA

Screw the grand coven and their silly rules. You two stick with me, and you can have anything, do anything you want whenever you want.

ELLE

When do we start?

ROWENA

[Waiter 1 is walking over with two plates and starts to stumble, looking confused]

Soon, but not here.

[Waiter 1 starts to sweat. His eyes and head are turning red and the plates drop to the floor. People in the restaurant turn to look]

Whoops. I believe that's our cue.

[Rowena and the womenm get up to leave. Waiters’ head is now bright red and peeling. He collapses to the floor]

CAITLIN

Did you do that?

ROWENA

Oh, he'll be fine -- worker's comp and all that. Are you coming?

[Voice off scene]

Call 911!

[Rowena walks past dead waiter]

[Scene changes to a Demon tied to a chair over a Devil’s Trap]

DEMON

I'm not afraid... 'Cause you're a noob.

[Person off screen throws Holy Water on Demon. Demon hisses in pain]

DEMON

[Laughing] I'm your first. That's why you're drawing this out. 'Cause you're studying me. You're training.

[More Holy Water is thrown on the demon. Demon grunts in pain, his face is burning]

It's gonna take a lot more than that to make me talk.

COLE

Boy, you will talk. You will talk, and you will tell me everything you know about your buddy Dean Winchester.

ACT FOUR
[Scene opens with Castiel and Hannah at a gas station. Castiel is putting gas in the car. Hannah is standing at the front of the car]

CASTIEL

At some point, we have to talk about what happened. The, uh...

[Camera changes to close up of Hannah]

HANNAH

He wouldn't listen, Castiel. He wouldn't let me go. I didn't want to hurt him. I could've erased his memories, but... It didn't feel right. I thought if he truly believed we were together, he'd give up. And it worked. So, why does it feel so bad?

CASTIEL

You did the right thing. You hurt him, but you gave him a reason, something he could use to move forward and make sense of his loss.

I had to take my vessel from his family -- twice, actually.

Jimmy Novak. He was a good man. He was married, had a daughter...Claire.

HANNAH

And?

CASTIEL

And it was difficult, but necessary.

The mission comes first -- always.

[Gas nozzle clicks and Castiel turns away from Hannah to replace the nozzle on the pump. When he turns back Hannah is gone]

[Scene changes to Dean (in FBI suit) talking to a waiter at the restaurant where the first waiter died]

WAITER 2

Middle of my shift, there's Marty falling down, clutching his head, stroking out right there on the floor, sweating, turning red, like...like...

DEAN

Like his brains were boiling? Was there anything else unusual?

WAITER 2

More unusual than our head waiter dropping dead in front of me?

DEAN

Before that.

WAITER 2

I don't know, I mean I thought getting two hookers in here was pretty damn unusual, but that was before Marty keeled over.

DEAN

Uh, two hookers?

WAITER 2

Based on what they were wearing, yeah.

DEAN

Were they alone?

WAITER 2

No. Came in with a lady.

DEAN

Thank you for your time.

[Scene changes to Sam (in FBI suit) sitting at an outside table talking on the phone]

SAM

No, that is strange. All right, I hear you. Thank you.

[Dean approaches Sam]

DEAN

Hey.

DEAN

So, it looks like our witch was here with two new friends.

SAM

Really? Raul's girls? What does she want with them?

DEAN

I don't know. What'd you get from the Hunter network?

SAM

This guy Darrell's been working a case, a series of grisly hotel murders one at the Kensington, another at the Waldorf in Cleveland -- bodies stabbed, impaled on the ceiling.

DEAN

Sounds a little more homicidal maniac than witchy.

SAM

That's what Darrell thought, too, until the autopsy came back. Actual cause of death --

DEAN

Let me guess -- boiled brains.

SAM

Yeah, same as our waiter.

DEAN

Well, I'll give this to the witch -- she's got deep pockets. The Kensington, the Waldorf, this restaurant -- that can't be cheap.

DEAN

Yeah. Let's get.

[Sam gets up from his seat]

DEAN

Where we going?

SAM

Check out every five-star hotel in the area.

DEAN

Oh.

[Scene changes to Hannah standing on a wood bridge over a stream. Castiel approaches her]

CASTIEL

What's going on?

HANNAH

I'm sorry, Castiel. I'm not going with you. I'm done.

[Scene changes to Hannah and Castiel walking on a path along the stream]

HANNAH

It's hard letting go... of a story, a mission. But what of the humans whose lives we sacrifice in the name of that mission?

CASTIEL

What of them?

HANNAH

We always said the humans were our original mission. Maybe it's time, Castiel -- time to put them first.

CASTIEL

Where is all this coming from?

HANNAH

Being on earth, working with you, I've felt things. Human things -- passions, hungers. To shower, feel water on my skin... to get closer to you. But all of that was nothing compared to what I felt when I saw him.

Her husband -- his anger and his grief. And Caroline was inside of me, screaming out for him, for her life back. These f-feelings, they aren't for me, for us. They belong to her. I know it's time to step aside.

[Hannah smiles, leans forward and kisses Castiel on the cheek. Castiel nods.]

Goodbye, Castiel.

[Hannah leans her head back and a bluish white light comes out of her mouth and rises into the air. Hannah collapses onto Castiel for a moment and then stands up again. She looks at her hands and then Castiel, slightly confused]

CASTIEL

Caroline, I'm --

CAROLINE (HANNNAH)

Castiel.

I know.

[Caroline looks at her hands again, smiling and laughing, and places her hands on her stomach, as if feeling her body]

ACT FIVE
[Scene changes to the exterior of a hotel. There is a knocking sound and the scene changes to Rowena and the WOMANs in a hotel room]

ROWNENA

Okay.

You two ready for some practice?

CAITLIN

Who is it?

ROWENA

Probably the hotel manager, probably here to complain that I haven't paid the bill. You have those spells I gave you?

ELLE

Yeah, about that? I don't read Spanish.

ROWENA

It's Latin. Phonetics are on the back, darling.

ELLE

[Looking puzzled] "Phonetics."

[Rowena walks to the door and looks through the peep hole. She sees the face of a pissed off looking bellman]

ROWENA

Get ready. And on my word...

[Rowena opens the door and sees the bellman with his throat slit. He falls forward to the floor. The WOMANs look scared. A man and woman lean into the doorframe, their eyes turn black.]

[Scene changes to the WOMANs and Rowena being led down the hotel hallway. Rowena’s mouth is covered with duct tape.]

FEMALE DEMON

You're in for a world of hurt when we deliver you to our boss.

CAITLIN

What about us?

I'm not going back to that place.

FEMALE DEMON

[Turning back towards the women]

Operation skank has been terminated. The only place you two are going is the dumpster out back.

[Female demon faces forward and turns right into Sam and Dean. Dean stabs the female demon in the stomach with the angel blade. She dies and falls to the ground. Rowena and the women run to the end of the hallway. The male demon moves forward and throws Dean to the ground. Sam fights with the male demon and is thrown to the ground. Dean comes up behind him and stabs him in the back with the angel blade. Sam and Dean move down the hallway to the women as Rowena removes her gag.]

CAITLIN

Who are those guys?

ROWENA

Hunters.

Let's get out of here.

ROWENA

That's not an exit.

DEAN

Don't worry, ladies. Our beef's not with you.We're here for the witch. Rowena.

ROWENA

Always nice to be recognized.

ELLE

Do something -- a spell!

ROWENA

[Looking towards the blonde WOMAN, placing a hex bag in her hand]]

That's an excellent idea.

Impetus bestiarum.

[Elle bends over with her head down and screams]

DEAN

What did you do to her?

[Rowena laughs as blonde WOMAN lifts up her head. Her eyes are read and blood is dripping from her nose. She snarls and punches Dean in the head and then Sam. They both fall to the floor. Rowena and the CAITLIN run past them down the hallway. Sam and Dean get up and face ELLE.]

SAM

[to Dean] Go! Go!

[ELLE advances toward Sam and the scene changes to Rowena and the CAITLIN running down an alley]

CAITLIN

What'd you do? What did you do to her?

ROWENA

Attack-dog spell. We needed a decoy.

CAITLIN

But... But she'll die, just like the waiter. Probably.Few humans are built to survive magic like that, and Elle was weak. But you're not.I saw it the second we met. You're strong.

CAITLIN

You're right. I am.

[CAITLIN punches Rowena in the face and walks out of the alley. Rowena lifts her head and points towards the CAITLIN]

Occideris ingrat

DEAN

Not another word!

[Dean has a gun pointed to the back of Rowena’s head. She turns and faces Dean]

Lady, your luck has just run out.

ROWENA

[Laughing]

I'm pretty sure that's not true.

[Camera pulls back and we see a gun pointed at the back of Dean’s head. There is a whistle and Dean turns his head to see Cole holding the gun on him]

DEAN

Pal, we got to work on your timing.

COLE

Drop the gun, Dean-o.

DEAN

All right, she may not look like much, but letting this one go -- big mistake.

COLE

Uh-huh.

ROWENA

You heard the boy.

[Dean drops his gun to the ground. Rowena smirks and walks away. Dean turns and faces Cole]

DEAN

Look, man, I am sorry about the last time we met, okay? I'm sorry about a lot of things. I'm not the same person that I was.

COLE

You're not a person at all. See, I know all about your kind now.

DEAN

My kind? Listen –

[Cole throws Holy Water in Dean’s face. He looks confused when Dean does not react.]

I'm not a demon anymore.

COLE

So, were you a demon when you murdered my father?

No.

COLE

Then you're still a monster.

[Cole hits Dean in the face with his gun. As he pulls back Dean grabs Coles’ hands to control the gun. They struggle and Dean grabs the gun, throws it to the side and punches Cole in the face.]

COLE

[Raising his hands to fight]

Let's go.

{Dean and Cole start to fight]

[Scene changes to the blonde WOMAN (Elle) in a linen closet. She’s hitting the door with her hands and body. Sam is on the other side trying to keep her inside]

ELLE

Let...Me...Out!

SAM

Look...Whatever she did to you, you have to fight it.

ELLE

I...Can't.

[Screams]

[Scene changes to Dean and Cole fighting. Cole gets thrown to the ground and makes a move to grab his gun. Dean kicks it away, grabs his gun and points it at COLE]

DEAN

Don't.

[Scene changes to Sam leaning against the closet door as Elle tries to break it down. He draws his gun and aims it at the door. He waits several seconds and the banging stops. He opens the door and sees Elle, bleeding from her eyes and nose. Her skin is white and her eyes are open. She falls dead to the floor]

[Scene changes back to Cole and Dean in the alley]

COLE

What are you waiting for? Do it.

DEAN

No. Now, I'm gonna clean this mess up once and for all. You're gonna give me five minutes, and we're gonna talk.

Get up.

COLE

After that... If you don't like what you hear...[Dean turns his gun and hands it to Cole]…you still want me dead, you take your shot.

[Cole takes the gun and points it towards Dean]

DEAN

What I do... is hunt monsters. Your dad, Cole -- your dad was a monster.

COLE

Yeah, you say that now, but last time we fought, you couldn't even remember his name.

DEAN

2003, Nyack, New York, Ed Trenton. I was working a case. Three dead --livers ripped out and eaten by your father.

COLE

Livers?

DEAN

Yeah, I tracked him down that night to your house.

COLE

Well, you say he was a monster.

What kind of monster was he?

DEAN

I don't know. Never seen that kind before, never seen it again. All I know is that he came home that night looking to kill -- could've been you, could've been your mom.

COLE

No.

DEAN

The only reason that didn't happen is because I was there to stop him.

COLE

I heard his voice. It was a human voice, and he begged you to stop!

DEAN

It's a ploy. It's a monster's trick.

I know what you heard, but know this -- that was not your father, Cole. Your father was already gone.

DEAN

[Looks over Cole’s shoulder and points.

Put it down. Sam, put it down!

[Cole turns and sees Sam aiming a gun at him. Cole aims his gun at Dean]

DEAN

Cole, it's fine.

SAM

Dean?

DEAN

Put it down!

[Sam lowers his gun and Cole turns his gun back towards Dean]

DEAN

Cole, hey, right here. We're talking, okay?

COLE

How can I believe you, huh?

{shouts] How can I believe you?!

My whole life, I've been...

DEAN

I get it. That was your story. Look, man, I got one of those, too. Okay, but those stories that we tell to keep us going? Man, sometimes they blind us. They take us to dark places --the kind of place where I might beat the crap out of a good man just for the fun of it. The people who love me, they pulled me back from that edge.

Cole, once you touch that darkness... It never goes away. Now, the truth is... I'm past saving. I know how my story ends. It's at the edge of a blade or the barrel of a gun. So, the question is, is that gonna be today?That gonna be that gun?

SAM

You've got a family, Cole.

[Dean and Cole face Sam]

I heard you on the phone that night. I'm guessing they need you to come back, and they need you to come back whole.

[Cole, crying, hand Dean back his gun]

[Scene changes to Caroline standing at the door to a house and Joe on the other side of the door. Joe opens the door and the look at each other. Camera pulls back to show Castiel sitting in his car at the curb in front of the house, looking at Caroline and Joe]

CAROLINE

I'm...

JOE

Hi.

CAROLINE

Hi.

[Joe and Caroline hug and walk back into the house. The door closes. In the car, Castiel open his laptop to ‘Websummon’ and types ‘Jimmy Novack’ in the search bar. Four pictures come up, one which shoes him as ‘Missing’]

[Scene changes to Cole driving his Jeep out of the alley. Sam and Dean remain in the alley]

SAM

He say where he's going?

DEAN

Home.

SAM

Rowena?

DEAN

In the wind.

SAM

What you said earlier, back there, about being past saving -- were you really --

DEAN

I was just telling the guy what he needed to hear.

We better go.

[Scene changes to Crowley and Gerald walking down a staircase. As they’re talking the approach a cell door]

GERALD

Winchesters showed up. Alpha team went down. But Beta team's working contingency -- Had a perimeter around the hotel. We got her. Right in there -- tortured. If you'd like, I could finish her off.

CROWLEY

Wipe that ridiculous smile off your face. What do you want, a medal? A "thank you" for cleaning up the mess you made?!

[Gerald walks away]

CROWLEY

Everyone working for me touched?

[Crowley opens the cell door and walks through]

Bunch of needy, squalling, incompetent infants.

[Rowena is chained to a wall in the cell. Her face is cut and bruised]

ROWENA

The king at last. King of what? Lilliput? I mean, I'd heard you were short, but...[laughs] Well?! Get to it. Time for the coup de grace. Wee boy, is something the matter with you? Cat got your tongue, hmm? Meow.

CROWLEY

Mother?
