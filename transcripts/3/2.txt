TEASER
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

A young mother is standing outside her house with a mix of worry and impatience. A car pulls up into the driveway; a girl of about ten years steps out, as does her father. The girl runs to her mother and hugs her.

MOM
Hey, sweetie. Hey.

DAD
Hey.

MOM
Thanks for driving her back here.

DAD
It's not like I had a choice. She pitched a fit.

MOM
(to the girl, who is hugging her tightly)
Hey, sweetie. What's wrong?

GIRL
Nothing. I missed you.

MOM
Okay, but tonight's your dad's night.

GIRL
No. I don't like Dad's night. I don't want Dad to have a night anymore.

MOM
Since when? You used to love going to your dad's house. And, you know, he loves you, and he misses you a lot.

GIRL
But I hate it there!

MOM
You don't hate it.

GIRL
Yes, I do! He's mean, and there are monsters there. I don't w-want to go back. Please don't let the monsters get me.

MOM (hugs kid)
Okay, sweetie. Okay.


INT. MAN'S WORKROOM - NIGHT

The little girl's father is in his workroom; there are wood-carved object sitting about, and one of those circular table saws you really don't want to see show up in a horror movie. He prepares to leave, and as he's shutting off the lights by the door, the table saw turns itself on. Curious, he approaches it, crouching down at table-height to shut it off. As he starts to leave a second time, the saw turns on again. This time, when he leans over the saw, a sudden whooshing seems to rush over him, knocking him on his back ... and onto the table saw. On which he dies a horrible gruesome death.

A wooden rocking horse on the table starts rocking creakily.


END TEASER
ACT ONE
INT. DINER - NIGHT

SAM is sitting at a table in a generic diner, working on his laptop and talking on his phone. DEAN is nowhere to be seen. SAM seems a bit frantic.

SAM
What do you mean you don't think it will work, Bobby? It's a demon-dispelling ritual.
(DEAN, who’s outside, raps on the front window and waves a packet of papers)
Well, maybe we got the translation wrong.
(The door jangles in the background.)
Look, we can't just let Dean fry in hell while we— (pause, to listen to Bobby; his screen shows another translation in process) ... Well, there's got to be something that w—.
(he sees DEAN approaching the table)
Oh, ah, yeah, no, ah, I I gotta go. Uh. Okay. Never mind.
SAM hangs up the phone quickly.

DEAN enters, looking suspiciously at SAM.

DEAN
Hey. Who was that?

SAM
(quickly)
Ah, I was just ordering pizza.

DEAN
(looking around)
Dude, you do realize that you're in a restaurant?

SAM
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I ... just felt like pizza, you know?
SAM smiles, tight-lipped and reeking of insincerity.


DEAN
(sitting)
O-kay, Weirdy Mcweirderton. (clears throat) So, I think I got something.

SAM
Yeah?

DEAN
Cicero, Indiana. Falls on his own power saw.

SAM
And? What, that's it? One power saw?

DEAN
Well... yeah.

SAM
And you think that this is a case?

DEAN
Well, I don't know. Could be.

SAM
I don't know, Dean. I – I –

DEAN
All right, there's something better ... better in Cicero than just a case.

SAM
And that is?

DEAN
Lisa Braeden.

SAM (sighs)
Should I even ask?

DEAN
Remember that road trip I took, uh... gosh, about eight years ago now? You were in Orlando with Dad wrapping up that banshee thing.

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, the five states, five-day –

DEAN
(laughs) Yeah. Well, kind of. Although I spent most of my time in Lisa Braeden's loft.

SAM
So let me get this straight. You want – you want to drive all the way to Cicero just to hook up with some random chick?

DEAN
She was a yoga teacher. It was the bendiest weekend of my life. Come on. Have a heart, huh? It's my dying wish.

SAM
Yeah, well, how many dying wishes are you gonna get?

DEAN
As many as I can squeeze out. Come on. Smile, Sam! God knows I'm gonna be smiling after 24 hours with Gumby girl.
(chuckles to himself; SAM laughs too, a little)
Gumby girl.
(he frowns)
Does that make me Pokey?

EXT. MOTEL - DAY

Pulling up outside a motel (Cicero Pines Motel) in Cicero, Indiana, DEAN stops to let SAM out.

DEAN
Don't wait up for me, Sammy.

DEAN starts to drive off as SAM is still pulling his bag out of the car, teasing SAM.

SAM
Wait, Dean. Dean, you... Dean!

DEAN drives off. SAM is left standing there like the little brother dropped off before the big brother's hot date.



DEAN drives through a suburban development, past houses being newly constructed and a sign for the "Morning Hill" neighborhood that notes "SOLD OUT!".

EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - DAY


Outside a nicely kept suburban house, with festive balloons, DEAN rings the doorbell. The door opens to reveal LISA: late twenties, brunette, very fit; she is gorgeous. DEAN smiles awkwardly; LISA stares at him in confusion for a moment, then recognizes him.

LISA
(with a big smile) Dean!

DEAN
Lisa. How's it going?

LISA
Wow. So, uh, how long has it been?

DEAN
Eight, going on nine years now. Crazy, right?

LISA
Yeah. So, what are you doing here?

DEAN
Oh, I was just – I was passing through, and, uh, I couldn't resist. I remember that you love surprises.

LISA
(chuckles) Yeah.
Dean Winchester. Wow. Just... wow. I'm – I'm sorry. You kind of came at a bad time. We're having a party.

DEAN
A party? Well, I love parties. (he hints, with a smile)


Cut to the party, in the back yard. Children are running around in the back yard, which is decorated for a kid's birthday party.

DEAN
So, uh, who's the party for?

LISA
Ben. My son.

DEAN
Oh. You have a –

LISA
Yep.

She gestures across the yard to a young boy wearing a black jacket and jeans. He is opening presents.

LISA
That's him.

A young kid is opening a gift to reveal a CD.

BEN
Yes! AC/DC rules!

DEAN
How old –

LISA
Eight.
(she sees the MOM from the teaser enter the yard)
Oh, Dean, could you excuse me a minute?

DEAN
(stunned)
Yeah, sure. Don't mind me.
(he turns back to watch BEN, who's eating a sandwich with gusto)
LISA walks over to the other mom and they embrace.


DEAN is looking at the birthday cake, which has a racecar theme. Two women are sitting in lawn chairs, watching DEAN from behind. They're whispering to each in gossiping tones.

WOMAN1 (brunette)
Did you hear Lisa call him "Dean"?

WOMAN2 (redhead)
Yeah. Why?

WOMAN1
You don't know about Dean? The Dean. Best-night-of-my-life Dean?

WOMAN2
No! Tell me.

WOMAN1
Oh, my god, so, they had this crazy, semi-illegal –

She cuts off as she sees DEAN approach; WOMAN2 gasps.

DEAN, seeing them staring at him
Hi.
The women continue to stare at him with a certain lascivious intensity.

WOMAN1
Hi.

WOMAN2
Hello.
(she crunches a piece of celery, loudly and somehow suggestively)

DEAN looks very uncomfortable, smiles nervously, and flees. The women look at each other.

DEAN finds BEN watching a bounce-house and eating a piece of cake.

BEN
What's up?

DEAN
What's up with you?

A woman and her little girl walk by; in unison, DEAN checks out the mom as BEN checks out the girl. Then they each take a bite of cake.

DEAN
So, it's your birthday.

BEN
Guilty.

DEAN
It's a cool party.

BEN
Dude, it's so freakin' sweet. And this moon bounce – it's epic.

DEAN
(slightly weirded out)
Yeah. It's pretty awesome.

BEN
You know who else thinks they're awesome? Chicks. It's like hot-chick city out there.
BEN smacks DEAN on the chest bro-to-bro.

DEAN watches bemusedly as BEN sets his cake down and follows a girl into the moon bounce.
BEN
Look out ladies, here comes trouble!

DEAN watches him, rolls his eyes up in his head as he does mental arithmetic, then darts inside the house, knocking things over as he goes.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

LISA is talking to the MOM, who is looking very frazzled.

LISA
So... how you holding up?

MOM
Fine.

LISA
Really?

MOM (shrugs, sighs)
Well, you know. ... I just... never mind.

LISA
What?

MOM
It's just ... I'm worried, about Katie. I think there might be something ... wrong with her.

LISA
Of course there is. The poor girl just lost her dad. She's devastated.

MOM
No. That – that’s not what I'm talking about. There is something really ... wrong ... with her. (pause, while she looks out at her daughter) I'm not sure that Katie is... Katie.

LISA
What?

MOM
I'm not sure that's my daughter.

LISA
I know you're grieving, but you can't talk like that. Katie needs you right now.

MOM
No, you don't understand –

LISA
Seriously. We're gonna get you help. It'll be okay.

The MOM shakes her head and runs outside to her daughter.

MOM
(outside)
Katie? Come on, we're leaving.

DEAN enters the kitchen.

DEAN
Hey. So, I, uh ... met Ben. (Lisa, distracted, looks at him, nodding absent-mindedly.) Cool kid.

LISA
Yeah.

DEAN
Yeah. ... You know, I couldn't help but notice that, uh, he's turning eight. You and me ... you know.

LISA
(chuckles, as she finally gets what DEAN is getting at)
You're not ... trying to ask me if he's yours?

DEAN
No. Nah, of course not.
(they both chuckle)
(beat)
He's not, is he?

LISA
What? (startled, slamming the oven door in her surprise)
(he raises his eyebrows)
No.

DEAN
Right.
(pause; watches BEN outside, gesticulating in a mini-DEAN fashion)
Yeah... (clears throat)



Outside, KATIE's MOM is talking to her.

MOM
Katie, sweetheart, we got to go. Okay. Come on.

KATIE and her MOM walk past the kitchen on their way out.

MOM
Come on, Katie.

DEAN
Something wrong with your friend?

LISA
She's been through a lot. Her ex just died in this horrible accident.

DEAN
Oh, yeah. Didn't I just read about that? The, uh, the power saw.

LISA
Yeah. Guess there's been a lot of bad luck in the neighborhood lately.

DEAN
What kind of bad luck?


INT. DINER - DAY

SAM is sitting alone in a diner again, with his laptop open, again. A young woman sits down across from him: it is Creepy Stalker Girl from last week (let's call her RUBY for simplicity).

RUBY
Hello, Sam.

ACT TWO
INT. DINER - DAY

SAM
You've been following me since Lincoln.
(she closes his laptop)

RUBY
Not much gets by you, huh?
(she takes one of his fries)
Mmm. These are amazing. It's like deep-fried crack. Try some.

SAM scoffs.

SAM
That knife you had. You can kill demons with that thing?

RUBY
Sure comes in handy when I have to swoop in and save the damsel in distress.

SAM
Where'd you get it?

RUBY
Skymall.
(she takes a plate and squeezes ketchup onto it)

SAM
Why are you following me?

RUBY
I'm interested in you.

SAM
Why?

RUBY
Because you're tall. I love a tall man. And then there's the whole antichrist thing.

SAM
Excuse me?

RUBY
You know, generation of psychic kids, Yellow-Eyed Demon rounds you up, celebrity death match ensues. You're the sole survivor.

SAM
How do you know about that?

RUBY
I'm a good hunter. So, Yellow Eyes had some pretty big plans for you, Sam.

SAM
"Had" being the key word.

RUBY
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. Ding-dong, the demon's dead. Good job with that. It doesn't change the fact that you're special ... in that Anthony Michael Hall E.S.P. visions kind of way.

SAM
(firmly)
No. No, that's stuff's not happening anymore. Not since Yellow-Eyes died.

RUBY
Well, I'm thinking you're still a pretty big deal. I mean, after all that business with your mom.

SAM
What about my mom?

RUBY
You know, what happened to her friends.
(off his attempted poker face)
You ... don't know. (pause) You've got a little bit of catching up to do, my friend. So, why don't you look into your mom's pals…
(she writes a number on his hand)
…and then give me a call and we'll talk again?
(she gets up to leave)
And, by the way, you do know there's a job in this town, right?
(she turns to go again)

Sam’s phone rings.


SAM
Hello.

DEAN is in his car outside LISA’s.

DEAN
Dude, there is a job here.

SAM
Really?

DEAN
Yeah. You know that one freak accident we read about in the paper? Turns out there's four more that never even made the paper, all in this ... Morning Hill gated community. People falling off of ladders and drowning in their Jacuzzis all over the neighborhood.

SAM
That is weird.

DEAN
Yeah, something's up. Something these nice, big gates can't protect them from.


INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

KATIE'S MOM is dozing, with the book The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova (a vampire novel) on the pillow. KATIE is watching her.

MOM (stirring, waking, sitting up)
(gasps)
Katie. What are you doing?

KATIE
Play with me, mommy.

MOM
Okay. Sure. Yeah let's, um, let's play.

KATIE
Oh, good.
(she hugs her mother)
I love you, mommy.

MOM
I love you too, sweetie.

KATIE’S MOM catches sight of KATIE’s reflection in a mirror. Her skin is gray, veined and blotchy. She pushes KATIE back in alarm, only to find that she looks normal. She looks normal in the mirror now, too.

KATIE
I'm hungry, mommy.

MOM (nodding her head, shaken)
Yeah.

KATIE watches her blankly as MOM turns toward the kitchen.


EXT. ANOTHER SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

SAM, dressed in a dark suit and posing as an insurance agent, is speaking to another young mother.

SAM
So, once again, I'm very sorry to disturb you. We just really want to expedite that life-insurance policy.

MOTHER
Of course.

SAM
Okay.
(she takes him around back, where a ladder leans against the wall)

MOTHER
This is, um, where he fell.

SAM
I see. Now, how exactly did he –

MOTHER
He was just inside changing a light bulb. Must have lost his balance.

SAM
Were you here when this happened?

MOTHER
No. I was out. Uh, the only one here was our daughter, Dakota.

Inside, a Creepy Little Girl is looking out at them. Something dark red is smudged on the window and railing.

SAM
Okay. (pause, while he looks around, from the daughter to the red smear) Well, uh, I think that's all I need.

MOTHER
Okay.
SAM

I'll get out of your way now.

MOTHER
Thank you.

She turns and goes up the steps with SAM behind her. He sees a strange injury on the back of her neck: it's an oval, with multiple dots around it, like the mark from a sucker or teeth.


INT. KATIE'S HOUSE - DAY

KATIE’S MOM is making a toasted sandwich. She puts a hand to the back of her neck, as if in pain. She sets the sandwich in front of KATIE.

KATIE
Thank you, mommy.

MOM
You eat. Mommy will be right back.

KATIE stars balefully at the sandwich, while KATIE'S MOM leaves the room. Frazzled almost to the point of breaking, KATIE'S MOM enters the bathroom and locks the door. She looks at her neck in the mirror, noticing a red mark, then startles at a sudden banging on the bathroom door.

KATIE
(pounding on the door)
Mommy?

MOMMY
Just – just give Mommy a second.
(She looks in the mirror at the mark.)

KATIE
Let me in. Mommy! Let me in. (pounding) Mommy! Let me in! (pounding) What are you doing?! (pounding) Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! (pounding)

MOM
Give Mommy a minute!

The pounding and rattling continue to build, until it stops suddenly as the doorbell rings. MOM goes out to the front door, where the REDHEADED WOMAN, aka WOMAN2 from the (leching-at-DEAN scene in ACT ONE, is holding out a gift basket and speaking to KATIE.

REDHEADED WOMAN
Aren't you just the cutest thing?

MOM
(taking the basket)
Oh, thank you. Uh, Katie, could you put these in the kitchen, please?

KATIE takes the basket and goes to the kitchen.

REDHEADED WOMAN
Katie seems okay, considering—.

MOM
She's fine. Yeah. Um, look, I'm –

REDHEADED WOMAN
And you – how are you doing really?

MOM
I'm fine. Look, we're fine. Um, this isn't a good time.

REDHEADED WOMAN
I wasn't sure if you were keeping the house or selling. We at Cicero Realty would like—

MOM
Look, I told you, it's not a good time!

She shuts the door and leans against it, sighing.

KATIE
I want ice cream! Mommy. Ice cream, please.

ACT THREE
EXT. PARK - DAY

DEAN is walking back to his car, when he notices BEN sitting sadly on a park bench.

DEAN sees him, and goes over and sits next to him.

DEAN
Hey, Ben.

BEN
Hey. You were at my party.

DEAN
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Dean.
(he sits down next to BEN)
Everything okay? Something wrong?
(Dean notices that BEN is holding an empty case. He looks out at the field and sees a group of four boys playing with a Gameboy-type thing)
Is that your game they're playing with?

BEN
Ryan Humphrey borrowed it, and now he won't give it back.

DEAN
Well, you want me to go—

BEN
No! Don't go over there! Only bitches send a grown-up.

DEAN
You're not wrong.

BEN
And I am not a bitch.

DEAN
Is that Humphrey? The one that needs to lay off the burgers?

BEN nods, smiling slightly.

DEAN
Hm.

CUT TO:

BEN walks across the park to the group of boys. They are all bigger than he. He clears his throat loudly and looks back at DEAN, who gives him a thumb’s up. He clears his throat again.

BEN
Ryan. (Kids look up.) I'd like my game back, please.

RYAN
(threateningly)
Fine. Take it back.

The other boys laugh. BEN looks nervously at the other kids, sighs, then turns as if to leave.

RYAN
See? Told you guys he was a—

RYAN cuts off as BEN turns back suddenly and kicks RYAN hard between the legs. RYAN crumples to the ground, and BEN takes the game back. DEAN looks around, smirking. He runs back to the bench and a grinning DEAN.

BEN
Thanks. Dude, that was awesome!

LISA
(who has seen the end of the exchange)
Benjamin. Isaac. Braeden! What's gotten into you?

BEN
He stole my game.

LISA
So you kick him? Since when is—
(she breaks off, looking at DEAN, who is still grinning)
Did you tell my son to beat up that kid?

DEAN
What? Somebody had to teach him how to kick the bully in the nads.

LISA
Who asked you to teach him anything?

DEAN
Just relax.

LISA
What are you even still doing here? We had one weekend together a million years ago. You don't know me. And you have no business with my son.
(She stalks over to Ben and grabs him to walk off with him.)


DEAN
Lisa.

LISA
Just leave us alone.

She and BEN begin to leave, but BEN pulls out of her grip and runs back to give DEAN an impulsive hug.

LISA
Ben!


BEN (hugging DEAN)
Thanks.

He runs back to LISA and they leave. DEAN watches them speculatively, until he notices three children with creepy stares watching.


INT. KATIE & MOM'S CAR - NIGHT

MOM is strapping KATIE into her car seat, which is made difficult by the fact that KATIE keeps touching and petting her.

KATIE
I love you most in the whole wide world, Mommy.

MOM
Um, me too, sweetie. Come on, hold still.

She checks the mirror and sees a monster with a large sucking mouth in the backseat. She turns around, but KATIE looks normal.

KATIE
What's wrong, Mommy?

MOM
Nothing, sweetie. Nothing.

KATIE
Are we going for ice cream now?

MOM
Yeah, we're going for ice cream.

MOM finishes strapping KATIE in, and gets in the driver's seat. She drives the car to the edge of a lake, is crying, puts the car in neutral, gets out, and watches the car roll in. KATIE turns and watches MOM as she goes down. MOM watches and cries.

MOM returns home and goes inside, slamming and locking the door behind her. She is crying brokenly. In the kitchen, seated over a puddle of water, is KATIE. She is dripping wet.

KATIE
Hi, Mommy.
Can I have the ice cream now?
(KATIE smiles winsomely. MOM gapes in horror.)



INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

SAM is at his computer, doing research. DEAN enters.

DEAN
Something's wrong with the kids in this town.

SAM
Yeah. Tell me about it.
(he is looking at a website on "CHANGELING LORE")
So, what do you know about changelings?

DEAN
Evil monster babies?

SAM
No, not necessarily babies.

DEAN
(realizing)
They're kids. Creepy, "stare at you like you're lunch" kids?

SAM
Yeah. There's one at every victim's house.


LATER, SAM is seated on the bed, as DEAN prepares a kerosene torch.

SAM
So, changelings can perfectly mimic children. According to lore, they climb in the window, snatch the kid. Y'know, there were marks on the windowsill at one of the kid's houses. Looked to me like blood.

They continue talking in voice-over as the scene shifts to KATIE'S house. MOM is asleep, with a bottle of pills on the bedside table. KATIE stares at MOM, brushes back the hair from her neck to reveal an 'odd bruise'. Her face morphs to look kind of like the Flukeman from X-Files, and she leans in to MOM'S neck.

DEAN (v.o.)
The changeling grabs a kid, assumes its form, joins the happy fam just for kicks?

SAM
Not quite. Changelings feed on the mom: synovial fluid. The moms have these odd bruises on the back of their necks. Changelings can drain them for a few weeks before mom finally croaks.

DEAN
And then there's dad and the babysitter.

SAM
Yeah. Seems like anyone who gets between the changeling and its food source ends up dead.

DEAN
(holding up the torch)
And fire's the only way to waste them?
SAM (nodding)
Yup.

DEAN
Great. We'll just bust in, drag the kids out, torch them on the front lawn. That'ill play great with the neighbors. What about the real ones? What happens to them?

SAM
According to lore, they stash them underground somewhere. I don't know why, but if it's true, the real kids might be out there.

DEAN
We better start looking.
(beat)
So, any kid in the neighborhood is vulnerable?

SAM
Yep.

DEAN
We gotta make a stop. I want to check on someone.

SAM
Well Dean, if the real kids are still alive, we don't have time. We—

DEAN
We have to.


EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

DEAN rings the doorbell, and LISA opens the door looking bewildered.

LISA
Dean? What a—

DEAN (breaking in)
I was thinking... Ben's birthday. I didn't even bring him a present.

LISA
That's okay.

DEAN
No. No, no, I feel terrible, so, uh...
(hands her a credit card)
Here. Take a long weekend – just the two of you – on me.

LISA
What?

DEAN
Yeah, I hear Six Flags is great this time of year. Go now. Avoid the traffic.

LISA
(reading the name on the card)
"Siegfried Houdini." Whose card is this?

DEAN
Mine. (LISA nods skeptically.) Never mind. It'll work. I promise.

LISA
You should leave.

DEAN
Lisa...

BEN
(coming down the stairs)
Mommy, what’s wrong?

DEAN
Nothing, Ben. It's cool.

BEN (tonelessly)
Make him go away, mommy.

LISA
You heard him. Get out.

DEAN
Lisa... I don't think that’s a good idea.

LISA
Get out!

DEAN watches LISA and BEN from outside the house. LISA is reading a book. BEN is sitting with an open book, staring at his mother. DEAN notices a damp red mark on a couple of window frames. He runs back to SAM, who’s in the Impala.

DEAN
They took Ben. He's changed.

SAM
What?! Are you sure?

DEAN
Yeah, I'm sure. I checked his windowsill.

SAM
Blood?

DEAN
I don't think it is blood, and I think I know where the kids are.


EXT. HOUSE-UNDER-CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

There's a large mound of dirt outside the semi-finished home, with a "Cicero Realty For Sale" sign. SAM picks some up and inspects it on his fingers.

SAM
Red dirt. That's what was on the window.

DEAN
Ah, you take the front. I'll go around.


INT. HOUSE-UNDER-CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

Inside, DEAN and SAM wander about with flashlights. DEAN hears a noise in the basement and goes to inspect, finding a series of cages, each containing abducted kids. He sees BEN.


DEAN
Ben... Ben... it's okay. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

Suddenly, the REDHEADED WOMAN (Cicero Real Estate lady) enters and sees SAM.

REDHEADED WOMAN
What do you think you're doing?

SAM sees her monster-like reflection in a pane of glass.

ACT FOUR

INT. HOUSE-UNDER-CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

WOMAN
This is private property. I'm calling the police.


CUT to DEAN, below.

DEAN is moving around the cages. He finds the real version of the REDHEADED Real Estate Woman in a cage.

REDHEADED WOMAN/MONSTER
You heard me! Get out!
(she advances slowly towards SAM)

SAM
(reaching for his bag)
Ah, I could — just let me get my bag. I'm going. I, I don't mean to cause any trouble.

SAM reaches for his bag and pulls out a flame-thrower which he aims at her; there is a whooshing noise and she has apparently disappeared. SAM looks around.

INT. LISA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

BEN starts acting like a Creepy Child, standing stiff-armed in the living room.

LISA is deeply engrossed in her book.

BEN
Mommy?

LISA (startles)
Ben...

BEN
Play with me.

LISA
This isn't funny anymore. I put you to bed three times already.

BEN
(hugging her)
I don't want to go to bed. (I want to be with you, Mommy.)

LISA
That's sweet, hon.



DEAN is opening BEN's cage. He pulls BEN out of the cage and hugs him.

DEAN
Come on. Let's go.

DEAN sets BEN down and ruffles his hair.

DEAN
All right, come on.



LISA'S HOUSE

BEN
I'm hungry.

LISA
Mini pizzas okay? Deluxe is all we've got.

BEN
Okay.

LISA
(turning away)
That's funny – I thought we were anti-olives this month.

She looks down and sees BEN'S reflection in the glass table; it has the icky Flukeman face. She gasps.


INT. HOUSE-UNDER-CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

DEAN breaks open cages and he and BEN help children out.

BEN
It's okay. You’re gonna get out of here, all right?
Hurry!
DEAN
Come on, girls! Come on! Keep moving, keep moving.
Okay, everybody back! Everybody back!
(he clears off a windowsill and prepares to smash the glass)
(BEN helps to usher the other kids away)
Cover your eyes!

He breaks the window with a plank of wood, and begins to brush the glass off.

BEN
(takes off his jacket)
Here. Use this.

DEAN
All right. All right, Ben. Come on. Come on.

BEN
(indicating another kid)
Him first.

SAM
(running in)
Hey! Dean! There's a mother.

DEAN
A mother changeling?

SAM
Yeah. We got to get these kids out quick.

DEAN
Right there, right there. There's one more. You got to break the lock!

SAM
I guess that's why the changelings are keeping the kids alive – so the mom can snack on them.

SAM (freeing the real REDHEADED WOMAN)
There. Come on, I gotcha.
The real KATIE screams as she sees the mother changeling behind her.



INT. LISA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

!BEN
What's wrong, Mommy?

LISA
You're not my son.

!BEN
Yes, I am.

LISA
Where's Ben?

!BEN
I'm Ben. I love you, Mommy.

LISA runs out the front door, grabbing her keys along the way. On the front lawn, a line of three Creepy Kids has formed, blocking her exit. They start to advance towards her. She runs back inside and slams the door, turning around to see !BEN.

!BEN
They don't want you to leave me, Mommy.


INT. KATIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

KATIE'S MOM is in the bathroom again, huddled on the floor, sobbing, as !KATIE screams and pounds at the door.

!KATIE
Mommy? Mommy? Let me in! What are you doing?! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!


INT. HOUSE-UNDER-CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

DEAN goes flying and lands on his back, groaning in pain. The Changeling Mom turns around. SAM has the flamethrower and a lighter. She kicks the lighter out of his hand, then roundhouse kicks him again, then throws a few punches and generally kicks his ass, before throwing him across the room. DEAN has gotten to his feet, and lunges after her with a 2x4. She punches and knocks DEAN down again.

DEAN
Ben, get them out of here!

DEAN, on his knees, grabs a brick and surges to his feet again to clock the Changeling Mom.

BEN helps the other kids up and out the window, and climbs out himself, as DEAN fights with the Changeling Mom. Eventually she faces DEAN and SAM to see SAM with the torch; SAM burns her to a crisp with DEAN'S homemade torch.

As she goes up in flames, !BEN, !KATIE, and all the other changeling kids, also disappear in flames, screaming "Aaaaahhh!" and "Mommy!"


ACT FIVE
EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - DAY

DEAN and SAM drive BEN back home; he runs out to hug his mom.

LISA
Ben?! Ben! Baby, are you okay?

BEN
I'm okay, Mom.

LISA
Oh, my god. (sobbing) What the hell just happened?

DEAN
I'll explain everything if you want me to, but, trust me, you probably don't. The important thing is, is that Ben's safe.

LISA
Thank you. (She hugs DEAN.) Thank you.

SAM
I'm gonna give you guys some time.

LISA (smiling at her son)
Come on.

She leads the way back into the house and DEAN follows.


INT. LISA'S HOUSE - DAY

BEN is sitting at the kitchen table, listening to something on his portable CD player. DEAN and LISA talk in the hallway.

LISA
Changelings?

DEAN
You know how I never mentioned my job? This is my job.

LISA
I so didn't want to know that.
(looking at BEN)
Do you think he'll be okay?

DEAN
Yeah. I think he'll be fine.
(beat) Okay, seriously... I mean, you're a hundred percent sure that he is not mine, right?

LISA
(smiling)
You're off the hook. I did a blood test when he was a baby.

DEAN
Oh.

LISA
There was this guy – some bar back in a biker joint.
(off DEAN'S look)
What? I had a type. Leather jacket, couple of scars, no mailing address? I was there. Guess I was a little wild back then. (pause, looks at BEN) Before I became a mom. (turns back to DEAN) So yeah. You can relax.

DEAN
Good.

He looks at BEN a little wistfully.

LISA
I... I swear you look disappointed.

DEAN
Yeah, I don't know. It's weird, you know your life... I mean, this house and a kid... it's not my life. Never will be. Some stuff happened to me recently, and, uh... Anyway, a guy in my situation – you start to think, you know. I'm gonna be gone one day, and what am I leaving behind besides a car?

LISA
I don't know. Ben may not be your kid, but ... he wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you. That's a lot if you ask me.

DEAN (looks back and heads for the door)
You know, just for the record... you got a great kid. I would've been proud to be his dad.

She kisses him.

LISA (laughs a little)
Look, if, um... if you want to stick around for a while... you're welcome to stay.

DEAN
(wistful pause)
I can't. I got a lot of work to do, and it's not my life.

She smiles at him. He smiles at her and leaves.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

This sequence follows SAM in jump-cuts as he talks to several different people on the phone, while systematically crossing names off a list.

SAM
Hi. I needed to check some facts with your, uh, with your secretary about a fire that occurred on November 24, 2006 in Lawrence, Kansas. Hardecker was his name.
Okay. Great.
I was just trying to find out the date he died.
This is police chief Phil Jones. July 13th.
Can you check the records for a Robert Campbell?
July 19, 2001.
Dead on arrival.
What I'm after is, is, is cause of death.
Heart condition?
Wasn't he a cardiac surgeon? Wouldn't he have known about that?
I'm looking for information on... on Mrs. Wallace's death.
Two deaths. Who was the other? ... Ed Campbell.
Any survivors?
No, that’s all I needed. Thank you very much.

He tosses the phone onto the bed and puts his head in his hands.

SAM
Oh, my god.

LATER, in another room. About halfway through SAM'S first statement it's revealed that he's speaking to RUBY.

SAM
They're dead. All of them. All of my mom's friends. Her doctor, her uncle – everyone who ever knew her, systematically wiped off the map one at a time. (laughs) Someone went through a hell of a lot of trouble trying to cover their tracks.

RUBY
Yep. The Yellow-Eyed Demon.

SAM
So, what's your deal? You show up wherever I am. You know all about me. You know all about my mom.

RUBY
I already told you. I'm –

SAM
Oh, right, right. Yeah, yeah. Just a hunter. Just some hunter who happens to know more about my own family than I do. (pause) Just tell me who you are.

RUBY
Sam, it –

SAM
Just... tell me who you are.

RUBY (laughing)
It doesn't matter.

SAM
(shouting in her face)
Just tell me who you are!

RUBY
Fine.

She blinks her eyes once and they go demon-black; she blinks again and they become normal. SAM backs up, fumbling in his bag.

RUBY
Think twice before going for that holy water.

SAM
(pulling out a flask and holding it out)
Just give me one reason I should.

RUBY
I'm here to help you, Sam.

SAM
Is this some kind of joke?

RUBY
God's honest truth... or whatever.

SAM
You're a demon.

RUBY
Don't be such a racist. I'm here because I want to help you. And I can if ... you trust me.

SAM
Trust you? (he holds out the flask of holy water)

RUBY
Sam, calm down.

SAM
Start talking. All those murders... what was the demon trying to cover up?

RUBY
I don't know.

SAM
What happened to my mother?

RUBY
I honestly don't know. That's what I’m trying to find out. All I know is that it's about you.

SAM
What?

RUBY (laughs)
Don't you get it, Sam?
It's all about you. What happened to your mom, what happened to her friends. They're trying to cover up what he did to you. And I want to help you figure it out.

SAM
Why would you want to help me?

RUBY
I have my reasons. Not all demons are the same, Sam. Not all of us want the same thing. Me? (shrugs) I want to help you from time to time. That's all.
And if you let me, there's something in it for you.

SAM
What could you possibly—

RUBY
I could help you save your brother.
