NOW


EXT. CRASH SITE - NIGHT

"Bad Moon Rising" is still playing on the radio as we zoom in on the wrecked Impala.

The demon-possessing-a-truck-driver steps out of his truck and walks over. Shot of John and Dean, both unconscious, then to Sam, who swallows, barely awake. The demon pulls the driver's side door off its hinges to reveal SAM pointing the COLT at him.

SAM
Back. Or I'll kill you, I swear to god.

DEMON
You won't. You're saving that bullet for someone else.

SAM
(cocking the gun)
You wanna bet?

It smiles; the black demon-ichor pours out of the man, who collapses. Sam uncocks the gun, drops his head back in relief.

MAN
Oh my god!

SAM
Dad?

MAN
Did I do this?

SAM
Dad! Dean? Dean!!

BRIGHT FLASH-CUT TO:


EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

A rescue helicopter descends to the site, and all three are being loaded onto stretchers. JOHN and DEAN are still unconscious, SAM is awake.

PARAMEDIC MAN
Significant passenger side intrusion. Unresponsive. BP is 180 over 60, heartrate 95, 95.

SAM
Tell me if they're okay!

PARAMEDIC WOMAN
You have to stay still!

SAM
Are they even alive?


INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

In a room, DEAN sits up, works his jaw, gets out of bed. He is wearing a white t-shirt, blue hospital pants, and nothing else. He goes into the hallway.

DEAN
Sam? Dad? Anybody?

DEAN goes down the stairs to the front of the hospital and finds a nurse's station.

DEAN
Excuse me. Hi. I, uh, i think I was in a car accident, my dad and my brother, I just need to find them.
(the nurse is unresponsive)
Hello?
(snapping his fingers)

He goes back upstairs, panicked, and finds:


INT. DEAN'S ROOM - DAY

Spirit!DEAN) sees his own body on the bed, intubated and dying. Close on his shocked face.

ACT ONE
INT. DEAN'S ROOM - DAY

Still reeling from the shock of seeing his unconscious body, DEAN turns, relieved, as SAM enters. SAM stops at the door and stares at his brother's body, breathing heavily.

!DEAN
Sammy! You look good. Considering.

SAM
Oh, no.

!DEAN
Man, tell me you can hear me.

SUBTITLE:
"In My Time of Dying"

!DEAN
How's dad? Is he okay? Come on, you're the psychic. Give me some ghost whispering or something!

DOCTOR
(entering)
Your father's awake. You can go see him if you like.

!DEAN
Thank god.

SAM
Doc, what about my brother?

DOCTOR
Well, he sustained serious injury: blood loss, contusions to his liver and kidney. But it's the head trauma I'm worried about. There's early signs of cerebral edema.

SAM
Well, what can we do?

DOCTOR
Well, we won't know his full condition until he wakes up. If he wakes up.

SAM
If?

DOCTOR
I have to be honest —

!DEAN
(overlap)
Oh, screw you, Doc, I'm waking up.

DOCTOR
(overlap)
Most people with this degree of injury wouldn't have survived this long. He's fighting very hard. But you need to have realistic expectations.

!DEAN
Come on, Sam. Go find some hoodoo priest to lay some mojo on me. Sam?


INT. JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

John is lying in a hospital bed, his arm in a sling. Awkwardly one-handed, he pulls something out of his wallet.

JOHN
Here. Give them my insurance.

SAM takes the card JOHN gives him, smiling as he reads it.

SAM
Elroy McGillicutty?

JOHN
And his two loving sons. So, what else did the doctor say about Dean?

SAM
Nothing. Look. The doctors won't do anything, then we'll have to, that's all. I don't know, I'll find some hoodoo priest and lay some mojo on him.

JOHN
We'll look for someone.

SAM
Yeah.

JOHN
But Sam, I don't know if we're gonna find anyone.

SAM
Why not? I found that faith healer before.

JOHN
All right, that was, that was one in a million.

SAM
So what? Do we just sit here with our thumbs up our ass?

JOHN
No, I said we'd look. All right? I'll check under every stone.
(beat)
Where's the Colt?

SAM
Your son is dying, and you're worried about the Colt?

JOHN
We're hunting this demon, and maybe it's hunting us too. That gun may be our only card.

SAM
It's in the trunk. They dragged the car to a yard off of I-83.

JOHN
All right. You've gotta clean out that trunk before some junk man sees what's inside.

SAM
I already called Bobby. He's like an hour out, he's gonna tow the Impala back to his place.

JOHN
All right. You, you go meet up with Bobby. you get that Colt, and you bring it back to me. And you watch out for hospital security.

SAM
I think I've got it covered.

He gets up to leave; John stops him, picking up a sheet of paper.
JOHN
Hey. Here. I made a list of things I need, have Bobby pick them up for me.

SAM
(reading)
Acacia? Oil of Abramelin? What's this stuff for?

JOHN
Protection.

SAM
Hey, Dad? You know, the demon, he said he had plans for me, and children like me. Do you have any idea what he meant by that?

JOHN
No, I don't.

Sam leaves, shutting the door to reveal DEAN, who has been leaning behind it.

!DEAN
Well, you sure know something.


EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

SAM looks down at the mangled car. BOBBY is there as well.

SAM
Oh man, Dean is gonna be pissed.

BOBBY
Look, Sam. This... this just ain't worth a tow. I say we empty the trunk, sell the rest for scrap.

SAM
No. Dean would kill me if we did that. When he gets better he's gonna want to fix this.

BOBBY
There's nothing to fix. The frame's a pretzel, and the engine's ruined. There's barely any parts worth salvaging.

SAM
Listen to me, Bobby. If there's only one working part, that's enough. We're not just going to give up on...

BOBBY
(quietly)
Okay. You got it.

SAM
Here, uh, Dad asked for you to get this stuff for him.

SAM hands over the list. BOBBY looks at it, frowning.

BOBBY
What's John want with this?

SAM
Protection from the demon?
(Bobby gives him a look)
What?

BOBBY
Oh, nothing, it's just, uh --

SAM
Bobby? What's going on?


INT. DEAN'S ROOM - DAY

JOHN is sitting by DEAN'S bed; !DEAN STANDS NEARBY.

!DEAN
Come on, Dad. You've gotta help me. I've gotta get better, I've gotta get back in there. I mean, you haven't called a soul for help. You haven't even tried. Aren't you going to do anything? Aren't you even going to say anything?
(he starts walking around the bed)
I've done everything you have ever asked me. Everything. I have given everything I've ever had. And you're just going to sit there and you're going to watch me die? I mean, what the hell kind of father are you?

He pauses, hearing something.

!DEAN
What is that?

!DEAN goes into the hallway and a spirit whooshes past him. He jumps back.

!DEAN
(to JOHN)
I take it you didn't see that.

!DEAN stalks the spirit down the hallways. He sees it go into a back hallway where a woman is lying on the floor, choking.

WOMAN
Help! Help!

!DEAN
Hey! I need some help in here!

WOMAN
I can't... breathe!

She pants loudly, trying desperately to breathe, then goes silent. !DEAN, leaning over her, looks on helplessly.


END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
INT. JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

SAM stalks into the room with a duffel bag; !DEAN meets him at the door and starts trying to talk to him.

DEAN
Sammy! Tell me you can friggin' hear me, man, there's something in the hospital. Now, you've got to bring me back and we've got to hunt this thing. Sam!

JOHN
You're quiet.

SAM turns, fuming, and hurls the bag onto the bed with a crash.

SAM
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

JOHN
What are you talking about?

SAM
That stuff from Bobby, you don't use it to ward off a demon, you use it to summon one. You're planning on bringing the demon here, aren't you? Having some stupid macho showdown?!

JOHN
I have a plan, Sam

SAM
That's exactly my point! Dean is dying, and you have a plan! You know what, you care more about killing this demon than you do saving your own son!

!DEAN
(overlap)
No, no, no, guys, don't do this!

JOHN
(overlap)
Do not tell me how I feel! I am doing this for Dean.

SAM
How? How is revenge going to help him? You're not thinking about anybody but yourself, it's the same selfish obsession!

!DEAN
(overlap)
Come on guys, don't do this!

JOHN
(overlap)
You know, it's funny, I thought it was your obsession too! This demon killed your mother, killed your girlfriend. You begged me to be part of this hunt. Now if you'd killed that damn thing when you had the chance, none of this would have happened.

SAM
It was possessing you, Dad, I would have killed you too.

JOHN
Yeah, and your brother would be awake right now.

!DEAN
Shut up, both of you!

SAM
Go to hell.

JOHN
I should have never taken you along in the first place. I knew it was a mistake, I knew I was wrong —

!DEAN
(overlap)
I said SHUT UP!

!DEAN smacks a glass of water off the table and it goes flying, crashing to the floor. Beat. SAM and JOHN look at each other, confused, !DEAN looks stunned.

!DEAN
Dude, I full-on Swayze'd that mother.

DEAN crumples in pain, flickering. Nurses and doctors start running by in the hallway.

!DEAN
What is it?

JOHN
Something's going on out there.

He jerks his head indicating "Go find out" to SAM.


INT. DEAN'S ROOM - DAY

Monitors are beeping, a doctor and some nurses are surrounding Dean, resuscitating him.

DOCTOR
All clear.

SAM
(huddling in the doorway, tears in his eyes)
No.

NURSE
Still no pulse.

DOCTOR
Okay, let's go again, 360.

NURSE
Charging.
(continues)

Shot on SAM'S face in the doorway, crying and fidgeting; !DEAN comes slowly behind him. He sees a ghostly figure floating over the body lying in the bed.

!DEAN
You get the hell away from me.

He runs to the bed and faces the thing down, yelling.

!DEAN
I said get back!

SAM blinks, looks confused, as if he's heard something.

!DEAN grabs for the spirit; he latches on momentarily before it hurls him back and then soars out of the room. The monitors slow, quiet.

NURSE
We have a pulse. We're back into sinus rhythm.

Dean runs into the hallway, looking for the spirit; it's vanished. Sam sighs in relief and backs into the hallway, watching from there. Dean comes back, stands by him.

!DEAN
Don't worry, Sammy. I'm not going anywhere. I'm getting that thing before it gets me. It's some kind of spirit, but I could grab it. And if I can grab it, I can kill it.

Sam looks over to where !DEAN was, confused. DEAN wanders the halls, then hears a girl yelling.

GIRL
Can't you see me? Why won't you look at me?

!DEAN
Now what?

GIRL
Somebody talk to me! Say something, please!

!DEAN
Can you see me?

GIRL
Yeah.

!DEAN
All right, just, uh, calm down. What's your name?

GIRL
Tessa.

!DEAN
Okay, good, Tessa, I'm Dean.

TESSA
What's happening to me? Am - am I dead?

!DEAN
That sort of depends.


EXT. TESSA'S ROOM

!DEAN and TESSA stand outside a room, watching what is apparently TESSA'S body, hooked up to tubes and machines. A woman sits by the bed, holding her hand.

TESSA
I don't understand. I just came in for an appendectomy.

!DEAN
Well, I hate to bear bad news, but I think there were some complications.

TESSA
It's just a dream, that's all. It's just a very weird, unbelievably vivid dream.

!DEAN
Tessa. It's not a dream.

TESSA
Then what else could it be?

!DEAN
You ever heard of an out of body experience?

TESSA
What are you, some new agey guy?

!DEAN
You see me messing with crystals or listening to Yanni? It's actually a very old idea. Got a lot of different names: Bilocation, crisis apparition, fetches... I think it's happening to us. And if it is, it means that we're spirits of people close to death.

TESSA
So we're going to die?

!DEAN
No. Not if we hold on. Our bodies can get better, we can snap right back in there and wake up.


INT. JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

JOHN
What do you mean, you felt something?

SAM
I mean it felt like, like Dean. Like he was there, just out of eyeshot or something. I don't know if it's my psychic thing or what, it... But do you think it's even possible? I mean, do you think his spirit could be around?

JOHN
Anything's possible.

SAM
Well, there's one way to find out.

JOHN
Where are you going?

SAM
I gotta pick something up. I'll be back.

JOHN
Wait, Sam. I promise I won't hunt this demon. Not until we know Dean's okay.

Sam nods, leaves.


EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

!DEAN and TESSA are walking down the hallway.

!DEAN
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

TESSA
With what?

!DEAN
With you. Most people in your spot would be jello right now, but uh, you're taking this pretty well. Maybe a little better than me.

TESSA
Don't get me wrong. I was pretty freaked at first. But now, I don't know. Maybe I'm dealing.

!DEAN
So you're okay with dying?

TESSA
No, of course not. I just think, whatever's gonna happen's gonna happen. It's out of my control, it's fate.

!DEAN
Huh. Well, that's crap. You always have a choice. You can either roll over and die or you can keep fighting, no matter what —

PA ANNOUNCEMENT
Room 237, code blue. Dr. Kripke to room 237, code blue.

TESSA
Where are you going?

!DEAN
Just wait here.

Dean runs down the hallway to another room in crisis. The same spirit is hovering over a little girl, who is being resuscitated. It reaches a hand into her face.

!DEAN
Get away from her!

He lunges at the spirit, which vanishes. The nurses stop resuscitation.

MALE DOCTOR
All right, let's call it.

FEMALE DOCTOR
Time of death, five eleven p.m.

NURSE
At least she's not suffering anymore.

Close on !DEAN looking stunned.

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
INT. DEAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Close shot on DEAN'S face; SAM enters the room quietly, clutching a brown paper bag in his arms.

SAM
Hey. I think maybe you're around. And if you are, don't make fun of me for this, but um, well, there's one way we can talk.

He pulls out a box labeled "Mystical Talking Board". !DEAN is now behind him., arms folded.

!DEAN
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

Sam circles around the bed and sits cross legged on the floor. He opens the box and pulls out the board.

SAM
Dean? Dean, are you here?

!DEAN
God, I feel like I'm at a slumber party.
(he sits opposite SAM in front of the board)
All right, Sam. This isn't going to work.

SAM has his hands poised on the pointer. !DEAN places his fingers on it and slowly, concentrating. slides it to "YES" on the board. SAM gasps.

!DEAN
I'll be damned.

SAM
(laughing in relief)
It's good to hear from you, man. It hasn't been the same without you, Dean.

!DEAN
Damn straight.

!DEAN places his fingers on the pointer again and starts sliding it. The camera circles around behind SAM to his POV - he is alone at the board, the pointer sliding under his fingers.

SAM
Dean, what? H? U? Hunt? Hunting? What, are you hunting?

The pointer slides back to "YES"

SAM
It's in the hospital, what you're hunting? Do, do you know what it is?

!DEAN
One question at a time, dude.

SAM
What is it?

The pointer slides again during the following, to R, E, A, P.

!DEAN
I don't think it's killing people. I think it's taking them. You know, when their time's just up.

SAM
A reaper. Dean. Is it after you?
(The pointer slides to YES.)
If it's here naturally, there's no way to stop it.

!DEAN
Yeah, you can't kill death.

SAM
Man, you're, um,

!DEAN
I'm screwed, Sam.

SAM
No. No, no, no, um, there's gotta be a way.
(he stands, pacing)
There's gotta be a way. Dad'll know what to do.
(he leaves)


INT. JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

SAM enters and sees that the bed is empty.

SAM
(whispered)
Dad.


INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

John pushes the door open and enters, carrying the duffel bag. He walks through a dark and dripping hallway to a clear space, places the bag down. He pulls out a box of white chalk and starts drawing a large symbol on the floor.


INT. DEAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sam returns carrying the JOURNAL. He sits on the edge of DEAN'S bed.

SAM
Hey. So Dad wasn't in his room.

!DEAN
Where is he?

SAM
But I got Dad's journal, so who knows? Maybe there's something here.

SAM flips open the journal and leafs through it, glancing up at DEAN's unconscious form occasionally.  !DEAN comes to stand behind him.

!DEAN
Thanks for not giving up on me, Sammy.

Sam turns to a page that says "Reapers", !DEAN leans over and reads something. His eyes go wide.

!DEAN
Son of a bitch.

He leaves, stalking down the hallway until he sees:


INT. EMPTY ROOM - NIGHT

TESSA is sitting on the edge of the bed. She's dressed differently.

TESSA/REAPER
Hi, Dean.

!DEAN
You know, you read the most interesting things. For example, did you know that reapers can alter human perception? I sure didn't. Basically they can make themselves appear however they want. Like, say, uh, a pretty girl. You are much prettier than the last reaper I met.

T!REAPER
I was wondering when you would figure it out.

!DEAN
I should have known. That whole "accepting fate" rap of yours is far too laid back for a dead chick. But the mother, and the body, I'm still trying to figure that one out.

T!REAPER
It's my sandbox, I can make you see whatever I want.

!DEAN
What, is this like a turn-on for you? What, toying with me?

T!REAPER
You didn't give me much choice. You saw my true form and you flipped out. Kinda hurts a girl's feelings. This was the only way I could get you to talk to me.

!DEAN
Okay, fine. We're talking. What the hell do you want to talk about?

T!REAPER
How death is nothing to fear.
(she touches his cheek)
It's your time to go, Dean. And you're living on borrowed time already.


INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

John has finished the chalk symbol, has placed several candles and a black bowl around it. He is incanting in Latin.

JOHN
(LATIN)

He slides a knife across his palm, drawing blood and dripping it on the bowl. He lights a match and drops it in; the sand in the bowl flares and goes out. JOHN stands, looking around. A hand grabs his shoulder.

MAN
What the hell are you doing down here, buddy?

JOHN
I can explain.

MAN
Yeah? You're going to explain to security. Come on. You follow me.

JOHN
(pulling the COLT and cocking it)
Hey. How stupid do you think I am?

DEMON
(eyes glowing)
You really want an honest answer to that?

Two possessed men in lab coats stalk by and take positions behind JOHN.

DEMON
You conjuring me, John. I'm surprised. I took you for a lot of things. But suicidally reckless wasn't one of them.

JOHN
I could always shoot you.

DEMON
You could always miss.
(laughs)
And you've only got one try, don't'cha? Did you really think you could trap me?

JOHN
Oh, I don't want to trap you.
(lowers the gun)
I want to make a deal.

DEMON looks intrigued.


END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
INT. DEAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sam is standing on the window side of Dean's bed, hands in his pockets. !DEAN is not there.

SAM
Dean, are you here?
(looks around)
I couldn't find anything in the book. I don't know how to help you. But I'll keep trying, all right? As long as you keep fighting. I mean, come on you can't, you can't leave me here alone with Dad. We'll kill each other, you know that.
(pause)
Dean, you gotta hold on. You can't go, man, not now. We were just starting to be brothers again. Can you hear me?


INT. EMPTY ROOM - NIGHT

!DEAN is staring out a dark window.

!DEAN
Look, I'm sure you've heard this before, but... you've gotta make an exception, you've gotta cut me a break.

T!REAPER
Stage three: bargaining.

!DEAN
I'm serious. My family's in danger. See, we're kind of in the middle of this, um, war, and they need me.

T!REAPER
The fight's over.

!DEAN
No, it isn't.

T!REAPER
It is for you. Dean. You're not the first soldier I've plucked from the field. They all feel the same. They can't leave. Victory hangs in the balance. But they're wrong. The battle goes on without them.

!DEAN
My brother. He could die without me.

T!REAPER
Maybe he will, maybe he won't. Nothing you can do about it. It's an honorable death. A warrior's death.

!DEAN
I think I'll pass on the seventy-two virgins, thanks. I'm not that into prude chicks anyway.

T!REAPER
That's funny. You're very cute.

!DEAN
There's no such thing as an honorable death. My corpse is going to rot in the ground and my family is going to die! No. I'm not going with you, I don't care what you do.

T!REAPER
Well, like you said. There's always a choice. I can't make you come with me. But you're not getting back in your body. And that's just facts. So yes, you can stay. You'll stay here for years. Disembodied, scared, and over the decades it'll probably drive you mad. Maybe you'll even get violent.

!DEAN
What are you saying?

T!REAPER
Dean. How do you think angry spirits are born? They can't let go and they can't move on. And you're about to become one. The same thing you hunt.


INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

The DEMON, JOHN, and the two minions are still in a circle around the summoning symbol.

DEMON
It's very unseemly, making deals with devils. How do I know this isn't just another trick?

JOHN
It's no trick. I will give you the Colt and the bullet, but you've got to help Dean. You've got to bring him back.

DEMON
Why, John, you're a sentimentalist. If only your boys knew how much their daddy loved them.

JOHN
It's a good trade. You care a hell of a lot more about this gun than you do Dean.

DEMON
Don't be so sure. He killed some people very special to me. But still, you're right, he isn't much of a threat. And neither is your other son.
(JOHN lowers his head, raises his eyes.)
You know the truth, right? About Sammy? And the other children?

JOHN
Yeah. I've known for a while.

DEMON
But Sam doesn't, does he? You've been playing dumb.

JOHN
Can you bring Dean back? Yes or no?

DEMON
No. But I know someone who can. it's not a problem.

JOHN
Good.
Before I give you the gun, I'm going to want to make sure that Dean's okay. With my own eyes.

DEMON
Oh, John, I'm offended. Don't you trust me?
(JOHN shakes his head slowly)
Fine.

JOHN
So we have a deal?

DEMON
No, John, not yet. You still need to sweeten the pot.

JOHN
With what?

DEMON
There's something else I want, as much as that gun. Maybe more.



INT. EMPTY ROOM - NIGHT

!DEAN is sitting on the bed, TESSA/REAPER behind him. She strokes his hair tenderly.

T!REAPER
It's time to put the pain behind you.

!DEAN
And go where?

T!REAPER
Sorry. I can't give away the big punchline. Moment of truth. No changing your mind later. So what's it going to be?

As he turns to look at her, the lights start flickering, a familiar buzzing starts.

!DEAN
What are you doing that for?

T!REAPER
I'm not doing it.

The both turn to a vent in the floor and see black demon ichor pour out of it.

!DEAN
What the hell?

T!REAPER
You can't do this! Get away!

!DEAN
What's happening?!

TESSA/REAPER screams as the demon flows into her mouth. She turns, eyes glowing yellow.

DEMON-IN-TESSA/REAPER
Today's your lucky day, kid.

DEMON places a hand on DEAN'S forehead; he convulses.


INT. DEAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

SAM is still sitting on the bed as DEAN gasps, waking suddenly and choking on the tube in his throat.

SAM
Dean?
(into the hallway)
Help! I need help!


END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INT. DEAN'S ROOM - DAY

DOCTOR
I can't explain it. The edema's vanished. The internal contusions are healed. Your vitals are good. You have some kind of angel watching over you.

DEAN
Thanks, doc.
(The doctor leaves; DEAN turns to SAM)
So you said a Reaper was after me?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
How'd I ditch it?

SAM
You got me. Dean, you really don't remember anything?

DEAN
No. Except this pit in my stomach. Sam, something's wrong.

A knock at the door; JOHN hovers in the doorway.

JOHN
How you feeling, dude?

DEAN
Fine, I guess. I'm alive.

JOHN
That's what matters.

SAM
(angry)
Where were you last night?

JOHN
I had some things to take care of.

SAM
Well, that's specific.

DEAN
Come on, Sam.

SAM
Did you go after the demon?

JOHN
No.

SAM
You know, why don't I believe you right now?

JOHN
(pleading)
Can we not fight? You know, half the time we're fighting, I don't know what we're fighting about. We're just butting heads. Sammy, I, I've made some mistakes. But I've always done the best I could. I just don't want to fight anymore, okay?

SAM
Dad, are you all right?

JOHN
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just a little tired. Hey, son, would you, uh, would you mind getting me a cup of caffeine?

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

SAM leaves, still frowning. JOHN looks after him sadly.

DEAN
What is it?

JOHN
You know, when you were a kid, I'd come home from a hunt, and after what I'd seen, I'd be, I'd be wrecked. And you, you'd come up to me and you, you'd put your hand on my shoulder and you'd look me in the eye and you'd... You'd say "It's okay, Dad"
(pauses)
Dean, I'm sorry.

DEAN
What?

JOHN
You shouldn't have had to say that to me, I should have been saying that to you. You know, I put, I put too much on your shoulders, I made you grow up too fast. You took care of Sammy, you took care of me. You did that, and you didn't complain, not once. I just want you to know that I am so proud of you.

DEAN
This really you talking?

JOHN
Yeah. Yeah, it's really me.

DEAN
Why are you saying this stuff?

JOHN comes closer, puts a hand on DEAN'S shoulder.

JOHN
I want you to watch out for Sammy, okay?

DEAN
Yeah, dad, you know I will. You're scaring me.

JOHN
Don't be scared, Dean.

JOHN leans over and whispers something into DEAN'S ear. DEAN pulls back in shock, processing. JOHN leaves, and DEAN stares after him.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

JOHN enters and places the colt on a small bed table.

JOHN
Okay.


INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Sam walks back to the room carrying a cup of coffee. He looks into a room and sees JOHN on the floor.

SAM
Dad?!

(SILENCE - SLOW MOTION)
Dropping the cup, SAM runs to JOHN's side, kneeling over him and screaming for help.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Once again, a crowd of doctors and nurses attempt resuscitation, this time on John. DEAN and SAM hover in the doorway, and a nurse tries to push them out.

DEAN
No, no, no, it's our dad. It's our dad!
(pleading)
Come on.

DOCTOR
Okay, stop compressions.

DEAN
Come on, come on.

NURSE
