A still frame of a tropical beach scene. Hawaiian-style music plays.

INT. AIRPORT – DAY

A plane taking off is heard.

A very NERVOUS MAN in a suit, GEORGE PHELPS, sits up. PHELPS checks his ticket and enters the bathroom.

INTERCOM
Thank you for flying United Britannia Airlines.

INT. AIRPORT BATHROOM – DAY

PHELPS is leaning over the sink, splashing water on his face. A SECOND MAN comes out of the stall area and dries his hands.

SECOND MAN
Nervous flyer?

PHELPS
It's that obvious, huh?

SECOND MAN
You know, what are the odds of dying in a plane crash? I mean, what? Twenty thousand to one?

PHELPS watches him go.

PHELPS
Wow. That's, uh, really reassuring. Thank you.

Above his head, a cloud of black particles exits a vent, swirls around his head, and enters his eyes.

INT. PLANE – DAY

PILOT
Thanks.

The PILOT, CHUCK, turns and addresses a FLIGHT ATTENDANT, AMANDA.

CHUCK
Amanda, how are you today?

AMANDA
I'm doing just fine, Chuck.

AMANDA addresses a PASSENGER.

AMANDA
Welcome aboard. 15C towards the back of the plane, on the right.

PASSENGER
Thank you.

AMANDA addresses PHELPS.

AMANDA
Have a nice flight, sir.

PHELPS turns, and we and AMANDA see that his eyes are completely black, even the whites.

PHELPS
Oh, I'm counting on it.

AMANDA blinks several times, watching PHELPS, and shakes her head.

AMANDA
Um...uh, 11F, that's the middle of the plane, on...

PASSENGER 2
Thank you.

AMANDA
...the left.

INT. PLANE – DAY

COPILOT
In just a few minutes our flight crew will begin room service in the cabin...

PHELPS turns to his seatmate.

PHELPS
Excuse me. Do you know how long we've been up?

WOMAN
Oh, uh...

The WOMAN checks her watch.

WOMAN
About forty minutes.

PHELPS
Wow. Time really does fly, huh? Excuse me. I've got to stretch my legs.

PHELPS gets up, squeezes past the WOMAN, and heads to the back of the plane. When he reaches the rear exit, he grasps the release handle. A YOUNG MAN in an aisle seat, MAX JAFFEY, notices him.

MAX
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

PHELPS turns to look at MAX, eyes black again, then rips the door open. He goes flying out the window, the door flies off tearing half a wing off the plane, and the plane goes down. AMANDA struggles to get to a seat and, after the oxygen masks deploy, to get one over her face. MAX, CHUCK, and the COPILOT already have them on.

ACT ONE
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

DEAN is asleep on his stomach.

Starring
JARED PADALECKI

JENSEN ACKLES

As the door opens, DEAN awakens and slips a hand under his pillow for a weapon.

Guest Starring
JAIME RAY NEWMAN

As he turns to look, he sees SAM entering, carrying coffee and pastries.

SAM
Morning, sunshine.

DEAN
What time is it?

SAM
Uh, it's about five forty-five.

DEAN
In the morning?

SAM
Yep.

DEAN
Where does the day go?

DEAN sits up.

BRIAN MARKINSON

DEAN
Did you get any sleep last night?

SAM
Yeah, I grabbed a couple hours.

DEAN
Liar. 'Cause I was up at three, and you were watching a George Foreman infomercial.

SAM
Hey, what can I say? It's riveting TV.

DEAN
When was the last time you got a good night's sleep?

SAM
I don't know, a little while, I guess. It's not a big deal.

DEAN
Yeah, it is.

SAM
Look, I appreciate your concern—

Producer
PETER JOHNSON

DEAN
Oh, I'm not concerned about you. It's your job to keep my ass alive, so I need you sharp.

SAM shrugs.

DEAN
Seriously, are you still having nightmares about Jess?

Supervising Producer
PHIL SGRICCIA

SAM crosses the room, sits on the other bed, and hands a coffee to DEAN.

Co-Executive Producer
RICHARD HATEM

SAM
Yeah. But it's not just her. It's everything. I just forgot, you know? This job. Man, it gets to you.

DEAN
You can't let it. You can't bring it home like that.

Co-Executive Producer
JOHN SHIBAN

SAM
So, what? All this it...never keeps you up at night?

DEAN shakes his head.

SAM
Never? You're never afraid?

DEAN
No, not really.

SAM reaches under DEAN'S pillow to pull out a large hunting knife and holds it up as evidence.

Executive Producer
McG

DEAN takes the knife back.

DEAN
That's not fear. That is precaution.

Produced by
CYRUS YAVNEH

SAM
All right, whatever. I'm too tired to argue.

DEAN's phone rings.

DEAN
Hello?

INT. OFFICE – DAY, alternating with INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

JERRY
Dean, it's, uh, it's Jerry Panowski. You and your dad helped me out a couple years back.

Directed by
ROBERT SINGER

DEAN
Oh, right, yeah. Up in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, the poltergeist thing. It's not back, is it?

JERRY
No. No. Thank god, no. But it's something else, and...uh, I think it could be a lot worse.

DEAN
What is it?

JERRY
Can we talk in person?

DEAN eyes SAM. SAM eyes back.

EXT. FIELD – DAY

The Impala drives along a road.

INT. HANGAR – DAY

JERRY
Thanks for making the trip so quick. I ought to be doing you guys a favor, not the other way around. Dean and your dad really helped me out.

SAM
Yeah, he told me. It was a poltergeist?

MAN
Poltergeist? Man, I loved that movie.

JERRY
Hey, nobody's talking to you. Keep walking. Damn right it was a poltergeist, practically tore our house apart. Tell you something, if it wasn't for you and your dad, I probably wouldn't be alive. Your dad said you were off at college. Is that right?

SAM
Yeah, I was. I'm—taking some time off.

JERRY
Well, he was real proud of you. I could tell. He talked about you all the time.

SAM
He did?

JERRY
Yeah, you bet he did. Oh, hey, you know I tried to get a hold of him, but I couldn't. How's he doing, anyway?

DEAN
He's, um, wrapped up in a job right now.

JERRY
Well, we're missing the old man, but we get Sam. Even trade, huh?

DEAN laughs.

SAM
No, not by a long shot.

JERRY
I got something I want you guys to hear.

INT. OFFICE – DAY

JERRY
I listened to this. And, well, it sounded like it was up your alley.

JERRY puts a CD in a drive.

JERRY
Normally I wouldn't have access to this. It's the cockpit voice recorder for United Britannia flight 2485. It was one of ours.

RECORDING
Mayday! Mayday! Repeat! This is United Britania 2485—immediate instruction help! United Britanis 2485, I copy your message—May be experiencing some mechanical failure...

There is a loud whooshing sound.

JERRY
Took off from here, crashed about two hundred miles south. Now, they're saying mechanical failure. Cabin depressurized somehow. Nobody knows why. Over a hundred people on board. Only seven got out alive. Pilot was one. His name is Chuck Lambert. He's a good friend of mine. Chuck is, uh...well, he's pretty broken up about it. Like it was his fault.

SAM
You don't think it was?

JERRY
No, I don't.

SAM
Jerry, we're gonna need passenger manifests, um, a list of survivors.

JERRY
All right.

DEAN
And, uh, any way we can take a look at the wreckage?

JERRY
The other stuff is no problem. But the wreckage...fellas, the NTSB has it locked down in an evidence warehouse. No way I've got that kind of clearance.

DEAN frowns.

DEAN
No problem.

EXT. STREET – DAY

SAM is waiting by the car outside a Copy Jack. As DEAN exits, an attractive woman enters.

WOMAN
Hey

DEAN
Hi.

SAM
You've been in there forever.

DEAN holds up two IDs.

DEAN
You can't rush perfection.

SAM
Homeland Security?

SAM takes one of the IDs.

SAM
That's pretty illegal, even for us.

DEAN
Yeah, well, it's something new. You know? People haven't seen it a thousand times.

They get in the car.

DEAN
All right, so, what do you got?

SAM
Well, there's definitely EVP on the cockpit voice recorder.

DEAN
Yeah?

SAM
Listen.

He plays the tape, which has been edited to pull out a scratchy voice.

VOICE
No survivors!

DEAN
"No survivors"? What's that supposed to mean? There were seven survivors.

SAM
Got me.

DEAN
So, what are you thinking? A haunted flight?

SAM
There's a long history of spirits and death omens on planes and ships, like phantom travelers.

DEAN
Mm-hmm.

SAM
Or remember flight 401?

DEAN
Right. The one that crashed, the airline salvaged some of its parts, put it in other planes, then the spirit of the pilot and copilot haunted those flights.

SAM
Right.

DEAN
Yep.

SAM
Maybe we got a similar deal.

DEAN
All right, so, survivors, which one do you want to talk to first?

SAM
Third on the list: Max Jaffey.

DEAN
Why him?

SAM
Well, for one, he's from around here. And two, if anyone saw anything weird, he did.

DEAN
What makes you say that?

SAM
Well, I spoke to his mother.

EXT. HOSPITAL – DAY

The Impala is parked in front of the gate to a building with a sign out front reading RIVERFRONT PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.

SAM (voiceover)
And she told me where to find him.

EXT. GARDEN AT HOSPITAL – DAY

MAX is walking with a cane between SAM and DEAN.

MAX
I don't understand. I already spoke with Homeland Security.

DEAN
Right. Some new information has come up. So if you could just answer a couple questions...

SAM
Just before the plane went down, did you notice anything...unusual?

MAX
Like what?

DEAN
Strange lights, weird noises, maybe. Voices.

MAX
No, nothing.

DEAN
Mr. Joffey—

MAX
Jaffey.

DEAN
Jaffey. You checked yourself in here, right?

MAX nods.

DEAN
Can I ask why?

MAX
I was a little stressed. I survived a plane crash.

DEAN
Uh huh. And that's what terrified you? That's what you were afraid of?

MAX
I...I don't want to talk about this anymore.

DEAN
See, I think maybe you did see something up there. We need to know what.

MAX
No. No, I was...delusional. Seeing things.

DEAN
He was seeing things.

SAM
It's okay. Then just tell us what you thought you saw, please.

MAX
There was...this—man. And, uh, he had these...eyes—these, uh...black eyes. And I saw him—or I thought I saw him...

DEAN
What?

MAX
He opened the emergency exit. But that's...that's impossible, right? I mean, I looked it up. There's something like two tons of pressure on that door.

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
This man, uh, did he seem to appear and disappear rapidly? It would look something like a mirage?

MAX
What are you, nuts?

SAM tilts his head.

MAX
He was a passenger. He was sitting right in front of me.

EXT. STREET – DAY

The IMPALA pulls up in front of a house.

SAM
So here we are. George Phelps, seat 20C.

DEAN
Hmm. Man, I don't care how strong you are.

DEAN and SAM get out of the car.

DEAN
Even yoked up on PCP or something, no way you can open up an emergency door during a flight.

SAM
Not if you're human. But maybe this guy George was something else. Some kind of creature, maybe, in human form.

DEAN
Does that look like a creature's lair to you?

SAM turns to look at the perfectly ordinary house.

INT. PHELPS HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and SAM sit across from MRS. PHELPS. SAM is looking at a framed photograph.

SAM
This is your late husband?

MRS. PHELPS
Yes, that was my George.

DEAN
And you said he was a...dentist?

MRS. PHELPS
Mm-hm. He was headed to a convention in Denver. Do you know that he was petrified to fly? For him to go like that...

SAM
How long were you married?

MRS. PHELPS
Thirteen years.

SAM
In all that time, did you ever notice anything...strange about him, anything out of the ordinary?

MRS. PHELPS
Well...uh, he had acid reflux, if that's what you mean.

DEAN and SAM looks at each other.

EXT. PHELPS HOUSE – DAY

SAM and DEAN come down the stairs out front.

SAM
I mean it goes without saying. It just doesn't make any sense.

DEAN
A middle-aged dentist with an ulcer is not exactly evil personified. You know what we need to do is get inside that NTSB warehouse, check out the wreckage.

SAM
Okay. But if we're gonna go that route, we'd better look the part.

EXT. SUIT RENTAL SHOP – DAY

Black Sabbath's "Paranoid" begins to play.

DEAN and SAM exit a store, "MORT'S for style", wearing crisp black suits with white shirts. SAM adjusts his collar.

DEAN
Man, I look like one of the Blues Brothers.

SAM
No, you don't. You look more like a...seventh-grader at his first dance.

MUSIC
Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind

DEAN looks down at himself.

DEAN
I hate this thing.

MUSIC
People think I'm insane

SAM
Hey. You want into that warehouse or not?

MUSIC
Because I am frowning all the time

DEAN starts the Impala, SAM already sitting shotgun.

INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE – DAY

They enter the warehouse and show their badges to the SECURITY GUARD, who nods and lets them in. They walk among plane wreckage; DEAN pulls out a device and puts earbuds in his ears.

SAM
What is that?

DEAN
It's an EMF meter. Reads electromagnetic frequencies.

SAM
Yeah, I know what an EMF meter is, but why does that one look like a busted-up walkman?

DEAN
'Cause that's what I made it out of. It's homemade.

DEAN grins.

SAM
Yeah, I can see that.

DEAN's grin disappears.

DEAN runs the EMF meter over a piece of the wreckage with yellow dust on it and gets an audible spike.

DEAN
Check out the emergency door handle.

DEAN scratches at the yellow dust and gets some on his hand.

DEAN
What is this stuff?

SAM
One way to find out.

SAM scrapes some of the yellow dust off into a bag.

INT. SECURITY DESK OF STORAGE WAREHOUSE – DAY

Two AGENTS in black suits approach the security desk and show their badges.

SECURITY GUARD
Homeland Security? What, one team of you guys isn't enough?

AGENT
What are you talking about?

SECURITY GUARD
Two of your buddies went inside not five minutes ago.

The second AGENT looks at the first.

INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE – DAY

The AGENTS and several SECURITY GUARDS bust in, guns drawn, and search. SAM and DEAN hear them coming. The AGENTS and GUARDS see nothing.

EXT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE – DAY

SAM and DEAN peer around a corner and walk out casually. An alarm blares, and they run to the gated exit. Pulling off his suit jacket, DEAN throws it over the barbed wire at the top of the fence, and they climb over. He grabs the jacket.

DEAN
Well, these monkey suits do come in handy.

DEAN runs off. SAM follows.

INT. AIRPORT – DAY

CHUCK is sitting nervously in a chair. His COPILOT is giving him a pep talk.

COPILOT
Listen, Chuck. It's like getting back on a horse. Only in this case, a little twin engine. Not even a horse, more like a pony. I'll be right there with you too. Anytime you feel like you don't want the wheel, I'll take over. Look, Chuck, we don't have to do this today. I'm not trying to rush you.

CHUCK
No, the...the waiting is worse.

The COPILOT glances over his shoulder.

COPILOT
Okay, they're filling up the tank. Then we go.

The COPILOT gets up and leaves. CHUCK takes a drink of coffee. Behind him, a cloud of black particles exits a vent and rushes into CHUCK'S eyes.

INT. JERRY'S OFFICE – DAY

JERRY looks at the yellow stuff through a microscope; what the microscope sees is replicated on a screen.

JERRY
Huh. This stuff is covered in sulfur.

SAM
You're sure?

JERRY
Take a look for yourself.

Banging sounds from outside the office.

MAN
You effin' piece of crap...

JERRY
If you fellows will excuse me, I have an idiot to fire.

As JERRY leaves, DEAN goes over and looks into the microscope.

JERRY
Hey. Einstein. Yeah, you. What the heck you doing? Put the wrench down—

DEAN
Hmm. You know, there's not too many things that leave behind a sulfuric residue.

SAM
Demonic possession?

DEAN
It would explain how a mortal man would have the strength to open up an emergency hatch.

SAM
If the guy was possessed, it's possible.

DEAN
This goes way beyond floating over a bed or barfing pea soup. I mean it's one thing to possess a person, but to use them to take down an entire airplane?

SAM
You ever heard of something like this before?

DEAN
Never.

EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC – DAY

The COPILOT is waiting by a small plane; CHUCK, looking cheerful and relaxed, approaches.

CHUCK
I'm ready. Let's do this.

The COPILOT, confused, laughs and follows CHUCK to the plane.

INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT – DAY

COPILOT
How you feeling?

CHUCK
I feel great.

COPILOT
You'll be back flying jumbos before you know it.

CHUCK
I hope so. How long we been up?

COPILOT
Uh...almost forty minutes.

CHUCK
Wow. Time really does fly.

CHUCK suddenly dives the plane towards the ground.

COPILOT
What are you doing?

CHUCK elbows the COPILOT in the face. CHUCK's eyes are black.

EXT. ROAD – DAY

A tractor is trundling by as the plane suddenly appears, crashing into a telephone pole and then the ground.

ACT TWO
INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

DEAN and SAM are in full research mode, with images and articles taped to the walls and strewn across the beds, and SAM is looking at something on the computer. DEAN is reading something on one bed while sitting on the other.

SAM
So, every religion in every world culture has the concept of demons and demonic possession, right? I mean Christian, Native American, Hindu, you name it.

DEAN
Yeah, but none of them describe anything like this.

SAM
Well, that's not exactly true. You see according to Japanese beliefs, certain demons are behind certain disasters, both natural and man-made. One causes earthquakes, another causes disease.

DEAN
And this one causes plane crashes?

DEAN gets up.

DEAN
All right, so, what? We have a demon that's evolved with the times and found a way to ratchet up the body count?

SAM
Yeah. You know, who knows how many planes it's brought down before this one?

DEAN snorts, turning away.

SAM
What?

DEAN
I don't know, man. This isn't our normal gig. I mean, demons, they don't want anything, just death and destruction for its own sake. This is big. And I wish Dad was here.

SAM
Yeah. Me too.

DEAN'S phone rings and he answers it.

DEAN
Hello?

JERRY
Dean, it's Jerry.

DEAN
Oh, hey, Jerry.

JERRY
My pilot friend...Chuck Lambert is dead.

DEAN
Wha—Jerry, I'm sorry. What happened?

JERRY
He and his buddy went up in a small twin about an hour ago. The plane went down.

DEAN
Where'd this happen?

JERRY
About sixty miles west of here, near Nazareth.

DEAN
I'll try to ignore the irony in that.

JERRY
I'm sorry?

DEAN
Nothing. Jerry, hang in there, all right? We'll catch up with you soon.

DEAN hangs up.

SAM
Another crash?

DEAN
Yeah. Let's go.

SAM
Where?

DEAN
Nazareth.

EXT. ROAD – DAY

The IMPALA drives past a road sign reading NAZARETH 3. Black smoke is visible in the near distance.

INT. JERRY'S OFFICE – DAY

JERRY is again looking through a microscope.

DEAN
Sulfur?

JERRY nods.

DEAN
Well, that's great. All right, that's two plane crashes involving Chuck Lambert. This demon sounds like it was after him.

SAM
With all due respect to Chuck, if that's the case, that would be the good news.

DEAN
What's the bad news?

SAM
Chuck's plane went down exactly forty minutes into flight. And get this, so did flight 2485.

JERRY
Forty minutes? What does that mean?

DEAN
It's biblical numerology. You know Noah's ark, it rained for forty days. The number means death.

SAM
I went back, and there have been six plane crashes over the last decade that all went down exactly forty minutes in.

DEAN
Any survivors?

SAM
No. Or not until now, at least, not until flight 2485, for some reason. On the cockpit voice recorder, remember what the EVP Said?

DEAN
"No survivors."

DEAN thinks.

DEAN
It's going after all the survivors. It's trying to finish the job.

INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN is driving. SAM is on the phone. Rush's "Working Man" plays.

SAM
Really? Well, thank you for taking our survey, And if you do plan to fly, please don't forget your friends at United Britannia Airlines. Thanks.

SAM hangs up.

SAM
All right. That takes care of Blaine Sanderson and Dennis Holloway. They're not flying anytime soon.

DEAN
So our only wildcard is the flight attendant Amanda Walker.

SAM
Right. Her sister Karen said her flight leaves Indianapolis at eight pm. It's her first night back on the job.

MUSIC
Well I get up at seven, yeah
And I go to work at nine

DEAN
That sounds like just our luck.

SAM
Dean, this is a five-hour drive, man, even with you behind the wheel.

MUSIC
I got no time for livin' yeah
I'm working all the time

DEAN
Call Amanda's cellphone again, see if we can't head her off at the pass.

MUSIC
It seems to me
I could live my life

SAM
I already left her three voice messages. She must have turned her cellphone off.

MUSIC
A lot better than I think I am

SAM
God, we're never gonna make it.

DEAN
We'll make it.

MUSIC
I guess that's why they call me
They call me the working man

INT. AIRPORT – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM rush into the airport and check the Departure board.

MUSIC
Well they call me the working man
I guess that's what I am

SAM
Right there. They're boarding in thirty minutes.

DEAN
Okay. We still have some cards to play. We need to find a phone.

DEAN picks up a courtesy phone.

VOICE
Airport Services.

DEAN
Hi. Gate thirteen.

VOICE
Who are you calling, sir?

DEAN
I'm trying to contact an Amanda Walker. She's a flight attendant on flight, um...flight 4-2-4.

INT. AIRPORT, GATE 13 – NIGHT

PA VOICE
Amanda Walker, Amanda Walker, you have a phone call. White courtesy phone, gate thirteen.

AMANDA approaches the gate, hearing the announcement. She picks up the phone.

INT. AIRPORT – NIGHT and INT. AIRPORT, GATE 13 – NIGHT, alternating

DEAN
Come on.

AMANDA
This is Amanda Walker.

DEAN
Miss Walker. Hi, this is Dr. James Hetfield from St. Francis Memorial Hospital. We have a Karen Walker here.

AMANDA
Karen?

DEAN
Nothing serious, just a minor car accident, but she was injured, so—

AMANDA
Wa—wait, that's impossible. I just got off the phone with her.

DEAN pauses.

DEAN
You what?

AMANDA
Five minutes ago. She's at her house, cramming for a final. Who is this?

DEAN
Uh, well...there must be some mistake.

AMANDA
And how would you even know I was here?

SAM goes around DEAN to try to hear what's going on.

AMANDA
Is this one of Vince's friends?

DEAN
Guilty as charged.

AMANDA
Wow. This is unbelievable.

DEAN
He's really sorry.

AMANDA
Well, you tell him to mind his own business and stay out of my life, okay?

DEAN
Yes, but...he really needs to see you tonight, so—

AMANDA
No, I'm sorry. It's too late.

DEAN
Don't be like that. Come on. The guy's a mess. Really. It's pathetic.

AMANDA
Really?

DEAN
Oh, yeah.

AMANDA
Look, I've got to go. Um...tell him to call me when I land.

AMANDA hangs up.

DEAN
No, no. Wait, Amanda. Amanda!

AMANDA heads for the plane, greeting coworkers.

AMANDA
How are you? Hey, Bob.

The black cloud comes out of a vent, then goes back in.

INT. AIRPORT CHECK-IN AREA – NIGHT

DEAN
Damn it! So close.

INTERCOM
Thank you for flying United Britannia Airlines.

SAM
All right, it's time for plan B. We're getting on that plane.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, now just hold on a second.

DEAN is wide-eyed.

SAM
Dean, that plane is leaving with over a hundred passengers on board, and if we're right, that plane is gonna crash.

DEAN
I know.

SAM
Okay. So we're getting on the plane, we need to find that demon and exorcise it. I'll get the tickets. You get whatever you can out of the trunk. Whatever that will make it through the security. Meet me back here in five minutes.

DEAN just looks at him anxiously.

SAM
Are you okay?

DEAN
No, not really.

SAM
What? What's wrong?

DEAN
Well, I kind of have this problem with, uh...

SAM
Flying?

DEAN
It's never really been an issue until now.

SAM
You're joking, right?

DEAN
Do I look like I'm joking? Why do you think I drive everywhere, Sam?

SAM
All right. Uh, I'll go.

DEAN
What?

SAM
I'll do this one on my own.

DEAN
What are you, nuts? You said it yourself, the plane's gonna crash.

SAM
Dean, we can do it together, or I can do this one by myself. I'm not seeing a third option, here.

DEAN
Come on! Really? Man...

INT. PLANE – NIGHT

INTERCOM
Flight attendants, please cross-check doors before departure.

DEAN, in the aisle seat, is anxiously reading the safety card.

SAM
Just try to relax.

DEAN
Just try to shut up.

The plane takes off, with DEAN jumping at every rumble and sound. SAM smirks.

ACT THREE
INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT – NIGHT

DEAN is leaning back, humming to himself. SAM looks over.

SAM
You're humming Metallica?

DEAN
Calms me down.

SAM
Look, man, I get you're nervous, all right? But you got to stay focused.

DEAN
Okay.

SAM
I mean, we got thirty-two minutes and counting to track this thing down, or whoever it's possessing, anyway, and perform a full-on exorcism.

DEAN
Yeah, on a crowded plane. That's gonna be easy.

SAM
Just take it one step at a time, all right? Now, who is it possessing?

DEAN
It's usually gonna be somebody with some sort of weakness, you know, a chink in the armor that the demon can worm through. Somebody with an addiction or some sort of emotional distress.

SAM
Well, this is Amanda's first flight after the crash. If I were her, I'd be pretty messed up.

DEAN
Mm-hm.
DEAN turns to a FLIGHT ATTENDANT, who is not AMANDA.

DEAN
Excuse me. Are you Amanda?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
No, I'm not.

DEAN
Oh, my mistake.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Mm-hm.

DEAN looks to the back of the plane to AMANDA.

DEAN
All right, well, that's got to be Amanda back there, so I'll go talk to her, and, uh, I'll get a read on her mental state.

SAM
What if she's already possessed?

DEAN
There's ways to test that.

DEAN goes into his bag and comes out with a Virgin Mary-shaped bottle of water.

DEAN
I brought holy water.

SAM
No.

SAM snatches the bottle and tucks it inside his hoodie.

SAM
I think we can go more subtle. If she's possessed, she'll flinch at the name of God.

DEAN
Oh. Nice.

DEAN turns to go.

SAM
Hey.

DEAN
What?

SAM
Say it in Latin.

DEAN
I know.

DEAN leaves again.

SAM
Okay. Hey!

DEAN
What?!

SAM
Uh, in Latin, it's "Christo".

DEAN
Dude, I know! I'm not an idiot!

DEAN makes his way to the back of the plane, thumping a seat once after the plane shakes.

COPILOT
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your first officer speaking...

AMANDA is fussing with the drink cart and napkins.

DEAN
Hi.

AMANDA
Hi. Can I help you with something?

DEAN
Oh, no. I'm just a bit of an uneasy flier. It makes me feel better to walk around a little bit.

AMANDA
Oh, it happens to the best of us.

DEAN
Of course, you being a stewardess, I guess flying comes easy to you.

AMANDA laughs.

AMANDA
You'd be surprised.

DEAN
Really? You're a nervous flier?

AMANDA
Yeah, maybe, little bit.

DEAN
How is it that, being a stewardess, you're scared to fly?

AMANDA
Kind of a long story.

DEAN
Right. I'm sorry for asking.

AMANDA
It's okay.

DEAN
You ever consider other employment?

AMANDA
No. Look, everybody's scared of something. I just, uh...I'm not gonna let it hold me back.

DEAN
Huh.

AMANDA
So...

DEAN, quietly
Christo.

AMANDA
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

DEAN hesitates.

DEAN
Christo?

AMANDA
I—I didn't, I didn't...

DEAN
Yeah, nothing. Never mind.

DEAN returns to his seat.

AMANDA
Okay.

DEAN
All right, well, she's got to be the most well-adjusted person on the planet.

SAM
You said "Christo"?

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
And?

DEAN
There's no demon in her. There's no demon getting in her.

SAM
So, if it's on the plane, it can be anyone. Anywhere.

The plane shakes.

DEAN
Come on! That can't be normal!

SAM
Hey, hey, it's just a little turbulence.

DEAN
Sam, this plane is going to crash, okay? So quit treating me like I'm friggin' four.

SAM
You need to calm down.

DEAN
Well, I'm sorry I can't.

SAM
Yes, you can.

DEAN
Dude, stow the touchy-feely, self-help yoga crap, it's not helping.

SAM
Listen, if you're panicked, you're wide open to demonic possession, so you need to calm yourself down. Right now.

DEAN takes a long, slow breath.

SAM
Good. Now, I found an exorcism in here that I think is gonna work. The Rituale Romanum.

DEAN
What do we have to do?

SAM
It's two parts. The first part expels the demon from the victim's body. It makes it manifest, which actually makes it more powerful.

DEAN
More powerful?

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
How?

SAM
Well, it doesn't need to possess someone anymore. It can just wreak havoc on its own.

DEAN
Oh. And why is that a good thing?

SAM
Well, because the second part sends the bastard back to hell once and for all.

DEAN
First things first, we got to find it.

DEAN walks slowly up the aisle with his EMF meter, getting odd looks but no readings. SAM suddenly claps him on the shoulder, and he jumps.

DEAN
Ah! Don't do that.

SAM
Anything?

DEAN
No, nothing. How much time we got?

SAM
Fifteen minutes. Maybe we missed somebody.

DEAN
Maybe the thing's just not on the plane.

SAM
You believe that?

DEAN
Well, I will if you will.

DEAN looks down as the EMF meter spikes. The COPILOT exits the bathroom and heads towards the cockpit.

SAM
What? What is it?

DEAN
Christo.

The COPILOT turns slowly to face them. His eyes are black.

The COPILOT goes into the cockpit. DEAN looks at SAM.

ACT FOUR
SAM and DEAN head to the back of the plane towards Amanda.

SAM
She's not gonna believe this.

DEAN
Twelve minutes, dude.

AMANDA
Oh, hi. Flight's not too bumpy for you, I hope.

DEAN
Actually, that's kind of what we need to talk to you about.

SAM closes the curtain.

AMANDA
Um, okay. What can I do for you?

DEAN
All right, this is gonna sound nuts, but we just don't have time for the whole "the truth is out there" speech right now.

SAM
All right, look, we know you were on flight 2485.

AMANDA's smile disappears.

AMANDA
Who are you guys?

SAM
Now, we've spoken to some of the other survivors. We know something brought down that plane and it wasn't a mechanical failure.

DEAN
We need your help because we need to stop it from happening again. Here. Now.

AMANDA
I'm sorry, I—I'm very busy. I have to go back—

She tries to brush past DEAN, who stops her.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? But listen to me, uh...The pilot in 2485, Chuck Lambert. He's dead.

AMANDA
Wait. What? What, Chuck is dead?

DEAN
He died in a plane crash. Now, that's two plane crashes in two months. That doesn't strike you as strange?

AMANDA
I—

SAM
Look, there was something wrong with 2485. Now maybe you sensed it, maybe you didn't. But there's something wrong with this flight, too.

DEAN
Amanda, you have to believe us.

AMANDA
On...on 2485, there was this man. He...had these eyes.

SAM
Yes. That's exactly what we're talking about.

AMANDA
I don't understand, what are you asking me to do?

DEAN
Okay. The copilot, we need you to bring him back here.

AMANDA
Why? What does he have to do with anything?

DEAN
Don't have time to explain. We just need to talk to him. Okay?

AMANDA
How am I supposed to go in the cockpit and get the copilot—

SAM
Do whatever it takes. Tell him there's something broken back here, whatever will get him out of that cockpit.

AMANDA
Do you know that I could lose my job if you—

DEAN
Okay, well you're gonna lose a lot more if you don't help us out.

AMANDA hesitates.

AMANDA
Okay.

AMANDA leaves and goes to the cockpit. She knocks on the door and says something inaudible to the copilot, who follows her back. SAM pulls out the holy water. DEAN pulls out John's journal and hands it to SAM, who opens it.

COPILOT
Yeah, what's the problem?

DEAN punches him in the face, knocking him down. He pins him down and puts duct tape over his mouth.

AMANDA
Wait. What are you doing? You said you were just gonna talk to him.

DEAN
We are gonna talk to him.

DEAN splashes holy water on his skin, which sizzles.

AMANDA
Oh, my god. What's wrong with him?

SAM
Look. We need you calm. We need you outside the curtain.

AMANDA
Well, I don't underst—I don't know—

SAM
Don't let anybody in, okay? Can you do that? Can you do that? Amanda?

AMANDA
Okay. Okay.

AMANDA leaves.

DEAN
Hurry up, Sam. I don't know how much longer I can hold him.

SAM
Regna terrae, cantate Deo, psallite Domino—

The DEMON breaks free briefly and hits them both until DEAN manages to subdue him again. SAM picks up where he left off. The DEMON knocks DEAN off again and pulls the tape off his mouth. He grabs SAM by the collar.

DEMON
I know what happened to your girlfriend! She must have died screaming! Even now, she's burning!

DEAN recovers and hits the DEMON as SAM sits there, stunned.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM recovers and begins reading again. He puts the book down and helps DEAN pin down the DEMON, who kicks the book up the aisle.

SAM
I got him.

The DEMON exits the COPILOT's body and disappears into a vent.

SAM
Where'd it go?

DEAN
It's in the plane. Hurry up. We got to finish it.

EXT. PLANE – NIGHT and INT. PLANE – NIGHT, alternating

The plane suddenly dips and heaves violently. SAM struggles to retrieve the book as DEAN splays himself against the exit door, screaming.

SAM manages to grab the book and reads the rest of the exorcism. A bright electrical charge runs through the entire plane, which then levels out.

Various people ask if everyone's okay. AMANDA sighs in relief. DEAN comes out from behind the curtain. SAM stands up.

EPILOGUE
INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

The passengers from the flight are disembarking to an area milling with uniformed agents (PARAMEDIC, FBI, FAA, etc). The COPILOT is seated in a wheelchair with a blanket wrapped around him, being questioned by an FAA AGENT.

FAA AGENT
Sir, can you tell me what happened?

COPILOT
I don't know. I was walking through the airport, then it all goes blank. I don't even remember getting on the plane.

AMANDA is being questioned by another agent.

FBI AGENT
Anything else?

AMANDA
No, that's all.

She sees SAM and DEAN standing across the way and mouths "Thank you". They nod.

DEAN
Let's get out of here.

DEAN and SAM head for the exit.

DEAN
You okay?

SAM stops and turns.

SAM
Dean, it knew about Jessica.

DEAN
Sam, these things, they, they read minds. They lie. All right? That's all it was.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Come on.

EXT. AIRPORT – DAY

JERRY
Nobody knows what you guys did, but I do. A lot of people could have been killed.
JERRY shakes their hands.

JERRY
Your dad's gonna be real proud.

SAM
We'll see you around, Jerry.

DEAN begins to head off.

DEAN
You know, Jerry.

JERRY
Yeah.

DEAN
I meant to ask you, how did you get my cellphone number, anyway? I've only had it for like six months.

JERRY
Your dad gave it to me.

SAM
What?

DEAN
When did you talk to him?

JERRY
I mean, I didn't exactly talk to him, but I called his number. His voice message said to give you a call. Thanks again, guys.

JERRY leaves.

EXT. AIRPORT ACCESS – DAY

A plane with a red maple leaf on the tail flies overhead.

SAM
This doesn't make any sense, man. I've called Dad's number like fifty times. It's been out of service.

DEAN dials a number. As the voice message begins, he turns it so SAM can hear too.

JOHN
This is John Winchester. I can't be reached. If this is an emergency, call my son, Dean. 785-555-0179. He can help.

SAM fumes and gets in the car. DEAN follows, and they drive off. Music plays.
