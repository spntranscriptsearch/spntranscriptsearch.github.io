NOW
INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


The scene carries on from the end of 7.22 There Will Be Blood. DICK ROMAN is pouring drinks.


DICK ROMAN
How do you take it?


CROWLEY
Alcoholic. Shall we get on with this, then?


DICK ROMAN
Just extending the hand of hospitality.


CROWLEY
To a mutation like me? Tired of swimming in hot garbage, are we?


DICK ROMAN
[laughs] That was a little colorful, huh? Well... didn't mean to [he hands CROWLEY a glass] offend.


CROWLEY
Of course you did. So, if you're suddenly calling, I guess you're up to speed on the Winchesters, which means you intercepted the Prophet. And the Prophet told you that my blood is the key to everything. [He drains his drink.] You know what I like about you?


DICK ROMAN
Lack of pretension?


CROWLEY
You're smarter than you look.


DICK ROMAN
Oh, well, now you're just flirting.


DICK ROMAN gets up to pour more drinks.


CROWLEY
Not easy... to kill me, but doable. Especially for you lot. You kill angels. You can certainly wipe a demon off the board. And yet, here we are, negotiating like proper psychopaths.


DICK ROMAN
Well, I assume you have a vial of your blood stashed somewhere, and in the event of your death, it goes directly to Sam and Dean. [He hands CROWLEY another drink.]


CROWLEY
See? Smart assumption.


DICK ROMAN
One can't live on looks alone. Here's my offer.


CROWLEY
All ears.


DICK ROMAN
Full immunity for you and your constituency. I'm talking free-range grazing for all demonkind. I'm willing to cordon off, say, Canada. You and your crew can work your little deals, have your way with the locals.


CROWLEY
All of Canada?


DICK ROMAN
Have it.


CROWLEY
Fair. And down here?


DICK ROMAN
America's ours. Your sales team stays out – period. That's not up for negotiation. We need America. They're so fat.


CROWLEY
And in exchange?


DICK ROMAN takes a vial out of his jacket pocket.


DICK ROMAN
The blood of one sadly unimpressive demon in New Jersey. All I ask is that you give it to Frick and Frack, tell them it's yours, stand back, and let them come to me. [He gives the vial to CROWLEY.]


CROWLEY
I can't deny I long to see those two digested once and for all. You have a deal. I suppose you want it in writing?


DICK ROMAN
I don't kiss on the mouth.


CROWLEY
Your loss. I just so happen to have a standard rider... [he takes a scroll out of his jacket] right here.


CROWLEY unfurls the scroll, which is very long. DICK ROMAN grimaces. CROWLEY holds up a magnifying glass.


CROWLEY
I do so like this part. Don't you?


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)


ACT ONE
CAR – NIGHT


SAM
All right. Exit's in 3 miles.


DEAN
I still say this is a bad idea.


SAM
Dean, it was your idea, and it was the best one either of us had.


DEAN
I said it as a joke.


SAM
It was a bad joke – good idea.


DEAN
Yeah, only because we got no magic spell, no book – nothing on how to find a freakin' righteous bone.


SAM
We can call Castiel again.


DEAN
Dude, on my car, he showed up naked... covered in bees.


SAM
Yeah, I'm not really sorry I missed that.


DEAN turns on the radio.


MAN’S VOICE ON RADIO
...The price of stock hit an all-time high following Roman's acquisition of Sucrocorp. I say Roman's a buy.


WOMAN’S VOICE ON RADIO
Got to disagree with you there. I'm gonna call him a "wait and watch."


MAN’S VOICE ON RADIO
Come on, Lawshe. You're killing me.


WOMAN’S VOICE ON RADIO
Hear me out. This is a new sector for Roman.


MAN’S VOICE ON RADIO
That's right. He's holed up at Sucrocorp headquarters right now.


WOMAN’S VOICE ON RADIO
So sit tight. This –


DEAN switches off the radio.


DEAN
Holed up at Sucrocorp, huh?


DEAN and SAM look at each other.


EXT. STREET – NIGHT


The MAID possessed by BOBBY in 7.22 There Will Be Blood is walking along a street. Televisions in a store window are playing a DICK ROMAN interview. We see BOBBY’s reflection in the window.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – NIGHT


We see a close-up of the large devil’s trap in the light fixture. CROWLEY is reading from his scroll.


CROWLEY
"Should the party of the first part…”


We see a close-up of the scroll. It appears to be written in Latin and mentions Sam and Dean Winchester.


CROWLEY
“…fail to inform the party of the second part of his intent…"


DICK ROMAN
Pause right there. Correct me – that should be "party of the second part vis-a-vis party of the first part," 'cause we just amended clause [CROWLEY mouths the words along with him] 314-sub-a. That's right. You should do this professionally.


CROWLEY
Splendid. So, "Should the party of the second part…”


INT. CRYPT – NIGHT


DEAN
Well, I guess if we can't find a righteous bone in a friggin' nunnery crypt.


SAM
All right. Here – listen to this. Sister Mary Benedict, uh, taught the learning-impaired and died at age 23.


DEAN
Eh, it's a little young. Find someone who's had time to cook.


SAM is reading from a large book.


SAM
Okay, well, there was, uh... here – Sister Mary Eunice. Uh, fed the poor, became Mother Superior at age 60.


DEAN
Sounds political. Power corrupts.


SAM
Right. Um... listen to this – Sister Mary Constant, 83 years of quiet, humble nun-like goodness. What do you think?


DEAN
Wow. I want to be more righteous just reading this.


SAM
Exactly.


DEAN
All right, well, I lay odds on her. Here we go. [He walks over to a plaque bearing the name of Sister Mary Constant.] Well... let's bone this nun. [SAM makes a face.] Sorry.


DEAN smashes the coffin with a mallet.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


CROWLEY
"...in which case, the party of the second part forfeits all rights to Canada ad infinitum." I think we're done here.


DICK ROMAN
Susan!


SUSAN enters.


SUSAN
Yes, sir.


DICK ROMAN
Take this from Mr. Crowley, make triplicates, get pens and a notary. We're ready to sign this puppy.


INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


DEAN tosses a lit match into a bowl. Flames rise and then die down. DEAN and SAM look around.


DEAN
Is he trying to make a grand entrance or...?


SAM
I don't know...


DEAN
Son of a bitch. He's standing us up.


SAM
Well, we summoned him. Doesn't he kind of have to –


DEAN
If Crowley wants to screw you, he'll screw you.


SAM
Or... he can't come 'cause something went wrong.


DEAN
Maybe.


There is a knock at the door. SAM takes out his gun.


DEAN
Maybe it's good news.


SAM looks through a hole in the door, then opens the door to let in MEG.


MEG
You deal with him. I can't anymore.


DEAN
You might want to be more specific.


MEG
I was laying low halfway across the world when emo boy pops up out of nowhere and zaps me right back here.


DEAN
Why?


MEG
Go ask him. He was your boyfriend first.


EXT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


“Vincent” by Don Maclean plays.


♪ Look out on a summer's day ♪

♪ with eyes that know the darkness in my soul ♪

♪ Shadows on the hills ♪


DEAN walks over to a vehicle parked in front of the cabin. CASTIEL is sitting in the driver’s seat.


♪ Sketch the trees... ♪


DEAN leans in the open passenger window.


DEAN
Hey, there.


CASTIEL raises a hand in greeting.


♪ ...and the daffodils ♪

♪ Catch the breeze and the winter chills ♪


DEAN straightens up, closes his eyes, shakes his head and sighs before leaning in the passenger window again.


♪ in colors on the snowy linen land ♪


DEAN
So, Cas, what's, uh, what's, uh, what’s the word?


♪ Now I understand ♪


CASTIEL
Well, Dean, I've been thinking. Monkeys are so... clever, and they're sensible in that they leave the skins on the bananas that they eat. Is it really necessary to test cosmetics on them? I mean, how important is lipstick to you, Dean?


♪ Perhaps they’ll listen now ♪


DEAN
Not very. You want to come inside and, uh, tell us what's going on?


INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


CASTIEL
Now, you understand I don't participate in aggressive activity.


CASTIEL picks up a bone and sniffs it.


CASTIEL
Mm. Sister Mary Constant. Good choice.


DEAN
Why'd you go to Meg, Cas?


CASTIEL
When I left, I wanted to observe the flowers – and fruit. Flowers come first, obviously. But I heard nothing from them.


SAM
You heard nothing from who?


CASTIEL
The Garrison.


SAM
What happened to the Garrison?


CASTIEL
Well, finally, the silence was deafening, so I went to look... to the home of the Prophet. You know, Leviathan can kill angels. There's a reason why Father locked them in Purgatory. They're the Piranha that would eat the whole aquarium. They're gone. The entire Garrison – dead. If there's anyone left at all, they're in hiding.


DEAN
Um, I'm sorry. If the angels are dead, where's Kevin?


CASTIEL
I could steal them from their cages, the monkeys. But where would I put them all?


DEAN
Hey! [He claps his hands.] Focus. Is Kevin alive?


CASTIEL
I don't want to fight.


DEAN
No, I'm not – [very calmly] we're worried.


CASTIEL
They took him. He's alive. I felt such responsibility, but it's in your hands now.


DEAN
Wait. Hold on a freakin' minute.


CASTIEL
I feel much better.


MEG
Guys, what's all that?


MEG looks at SAM and DEAN's spell paraphernalia.


SAM
We called Crowley.


MEG
You what?


DEAN
Don't worry. He never showed.


MEG
What do you mean never –


DEAN
Do you see him anywhere? He stood us up.


MEG
Well, I'm sorry about that, but I'm outie. He could still sh–


CROWLEY
Show up at any time. Hello, boys. Sorry I'm late. This is an embarrassment of riches.


ACT TWO
INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


CROWLEY
[to MEG] Stay, won't you. There's really nowhere to run.


MEG runs for the door, but CROWLEY appears in front of her, blocking her exit.


CROWLEY
Don't even think of smoking out, pussycat. I've got eyes all over the place.


CASTIEL
Leave her be.


CROWLEY
Castiel. When last we spoke, you – well, enslaved me. I'm confused. Why aren't you dead?


CASTIEL
I... don't know.


CROWLEY
Well, do you want> to be? 'Cause I can help with that.


DEAN
All right, enough.


CROWLEY
It's enough when I say. I came here to help you. I find out you've been lying to me, harboring an angel, and not just any angel – the one angel I most want to crush between my teeth.


MEG
Oh, so you can crush angels now, huh?


CROWLEY
You bore me. You know that? You have no sense of poetry. [to CASTIEL] Now, what do you have to say for yourself?


CASTIEL
Well, I'm still, uh, honing my communication strategy. I haven't even been back to Heaven. I-I keep thinking there are no insects up there, but here we have... [DEAN exchanges a look with CROWLEY] trillions. You know, they're making honey and silk and... miracles, really.


CROWLEY
What are you talking about?


CASTIEL
Um, preferring insects to angels, I guess. Here. I can offer a token, if you like. [He holds up a plastic bag containing a yellow substance.] It's honey. I-I collected it myself.


CROWLEY and DEAN exchange another look.


CROWLEY
You're off your rocker. He's off his rocker – is that it? Karma's a bitch, isn't it?


CROWLEY helps himself to a glass of whiskey on the table.


DEAN
Look, did you come here to, uh, donkey-punch [CROWLEY sniffs the whiskey and puts the glass back down] your old grudges or to help us end Dick? Pick a battle.


CROWLEY
Well, I'm vexed. I'd like to do both. But where's the fun in clobbering a ball of wet fur? Text me when Sparkles here retrieves his marbles, I suppose. Meanwhile... [he takes a vial of blood out of his jacket pocket] a prezzie.


SAM
Really? Just boxed-up and ready to go?


CROWLEY
I'm a model of efficiency.


SAM
Is that right? Then why were you late?


CROWLEY
Dick had me in a devil trap. He's not an idiot. He knows what you two are after.


SAM
So what did he offer you?


CROWLEY
A fair deal. In exchange for giving you the wrong blood. It's demon, but is it mine? [pause] It's my blood. Real deal.


DEAN
And why should we trust you?


CROWLEY
Good God, don't. Never trust anyone. A lesson I learned from my last business partner. [He looks at CASTIEL.]


DEAN
All right. Give us the blood.


CROWLEY
Certainly. Oh, bonus. Meg, I'm gonna scoop you up, take you home, and roast you till you're jerky. [CASTIEL starts to move towards CROWLEY.] But not... yet. Cas can have you for now. Hilariously, it seems he'd be upset at losing you. And the boys need Cas to get Dick. Don't they, Cas?


CASTIEL
Oh, I – I don't fight anymore.


CROWLEY
Come on. Given the particulars of your enemy, sadly, you're vital.


CROWLEY tosses the vial of blood to SAM.


EXT. STREET – NIGHT


The MAID is walking down the street carrying a newspaper with an article about DICK ROMAN. She tries to open the passenger door of a pick-up. We see BOBBY’s reflection in the window. The MAID reaches for a mallet in the back of the pick-up. There is a sizzling noise, the MAID flies backwards with a yell and BOBBY emerges.


BOBBY
Son of a bitch! Pure iron. Damn it. [He looks at the MAID.] All right. My mistake. Let's go.


MAID
No! [She gets to her feet.] You stay away from me. Will you please let me go home?


BOBBY looks at the newspaper on the ground. The headline reads “Dick Roman nominated for Man of Year.”


BOBBY
I need you.


MAID
No.


The MAID turns to run away, but BOBBY engulfs her and possesses her again.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


DICK ROMAN and SUSAN are walking down a hallway, both looking at their phones.


SUSAN
Powerpoint presentation's on your desk for approval, sir.


DICK ROMAN
Great. Susan, do I look like a fool?


SUSAN
Not in that particular body, no.


DICK ROMAN
Good. Have I told you there are three rules to contract negotiation? Bring breath mints, get it in writing, and have a plan for when they screw you. Go to the freezer.


SUSAN
The arm?


DICK ROMAN
Yep, the arm. Thatagirl.


DICK ROMAN enters an office.


CUT TO: KEVIN trying to open a locked door. He gives up and walks away from the door. Behind him, a LEVIATHAN opens the door and a GIRL, who is chewing gum, enters.


LEVIATHAN
Sit. Stay.


The GIRL sits down in a chair and the LEVIATHAN leaves and closes the door.


KEVIN
I'm Kevin.


GIRL
Polly.


KEVIN
What are you doing here?


POLLY
Sitting. I guess.


KEVIN
Are you a prophet?


POLLY takes a bite of a stick of red licorice and doesn’t answer.


KEVIN
So... basically, I'm on my own, then.


INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


DEAN is holding the notebook in which KEVIN translated The Word of God.


DEAN
Well, one thing's for sure – we only get one shot.


SAM is holding the vial of blood that CROWLEY gave them above a table holding a bowl of blood, other containers of blood and candles.


DEAN
This thing don't reload.


SAM
You think Crowley's, uh...


DEAN
Double-crossing us?


SAM
Yeah.


DEAN
You've got to figure who he wants dead more – us or Dick.


SAM
Depends what Dick offered. Here we go. [He pours the blood from the vial into the bowl.] Okay. Um… [He picks up the bowl] so do we, uh...


DEAN
Uh, there's no magic words – nothing. We just... just go.


SAM
All right, then.


SAM pours the blood from the bowl onto the Sister Mary Constant’s bone, which is in another bowl. He and DEAN wait, but nothing happens.


DEAN
Where's all the thunder and lightning?


SAM
Uh... maybe it worked?


DEAN
Awesome.


We hear the sound of angel wings and a hand appears on DEAN’s shoulder. The hand belongs to CASTIEL, who is holding plates of sandwiches.


CASTIEL
So, none of this should cause you any ill effect. I went to a little farm in Normandy for the wheat and the lettuce and tomato and – and I thoroughly examined and comforted the pig before I... slaughtered it for the ham. Here. [He holds a plate out to DEAN.] You need your strength.


DEAN takes the plate.


DEAN
Thanks, Cas.


CASTIEL holds the other plate out to SAM, but SAM doesn’t take it.


SAM
And Cas, why was Crowley so certain that you need to come with us?


CASTIEL
Crowley's wrong. I'll be waiting right here. But please – accept this sandwich as a gesture of solidarity.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


DICK ROMAN is adjusting his tie.


SUSAN
Morning, sir. [She places a large container on his desk.] Delegates are on their way.


DICK ROMAN
Perfect. We're gonna want everything in place before they get here. Send in the security detail, would you?


SUSAN leaves and DICK ROMAN opens the container. Inside is a hand and forearm, on which is a watch.


DICK ROMAN
Hello Mr. Roman. Nice watch.


CUT TO: the office in which KEVIN and POLLY are being held. The LEVIATHAN enters and hangs a suit bag on the wall.


LEVIATHAN
Get dressed.


The LEVIATHAN leaves. POLLY stands up and starts unbuttoning her blouse.


KEVIN
Why does he want you to...?


KEVIN looks at hair pins in a clear plastic bag attached to the suit bag.


EXT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


DICK ROMAN and SUSAN are walking towards three black vehicles that are pulling up outside the building. The driver of each vehicle gets out and opens the rear door for men in suits to get out. The first man shakes hands with DICK ROMAN and SUSAN.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


POLLY is standing in the middle of the room wearing a gray dress. KEVIN is sitting at a desk. The LEVIATHAN enters, carrying a tray containing a burger, fries and a bottle of water. He puts the tray down in front of KEVIN.


KEVIN
I'm a vegan.


LEVIATHAN
You ready, Polly?


POLLYS murmurs an assent. The LEVIATHAN leads her from the room. KEVIN takes a drink from his water bottle. After the LEVIATHAN closes the door, KEVIN uses a hair pin to try to open it.


CUT TO: the board room. Men and women in suits are sitting around the table. DICK ROMAN stands at the head of the table.


DICK ROMAN
Well, I'm pleased as punch to see you all here. Last time we were in one room, it was inside that angel. [The leviathans around the table laugh.] Now, as key players, I need you up to speed on every aspect of the program, not just the sudden influx of happy, delicious stoners in your neighborhood. [DICK ROMAN takes a piece of sushi from a platter on the table.] Oh. Eat up. The sushi's made of fresh orphan.


WOMAN LEVIATHAN
[with a pleased expression, softly] Oh!


DICK ROMAN
All righty. The slaughterhouses – cutting-edge, humane, efficient. First one goes online next month.


We see POLLY sitting in a chair in a corner of the room.


MALE LEVIATHAN
What's the crowd-control strategy?


DICK ROMAN
Glad you asked. We've laid employees at key junctures of law enforcement, starting with the 911 call. Everyone feels taken care of…


KEVIN is listening outside the door.


DICK ROMAN
…everyone stays calm. We'll up the dose just before harvest time. They won't feel a thing.


DICK ROMAN presses a button on a remote and a map of the United States appears on a screen. The map is divided into regions labeled Labor, Testing and Livestock.


DICK ROMAN
We're taking a regional approach. Ohio: beta-testing. Wisconsin: processing. Florida: breeding program.


Outside the door, KEVIN flinches and turns to leave.


DICK ROMAN
If you'll flip to page 10, you'll see we're having a ball buying fertility clinics. Real juicy stuff.


KEVIN walks down the hallway towards the exit. SUSAN appears in front of him.


SUSAN
Why are you out of your cage, mouse?


DICK ROMAN
But now I want to talk to you about something I'm really excited about. [He nods to the LEVIATHAN standing next to POLLY, who then guides POLLY to the front of the room.] Everyone... meet Polly.


EXT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – NIGHT


DEAN and SAM pull up outside the Sucrocorp building. SAM is typing on his laptop.


DEAN
You got it yet?


SAM
Here we go.


The laptop screen shows footage from the board room, where the meeting is still in progress.


SAM
Thank you, Charlie, wherever you are.


DEAN
Got you, Dick.


SAM
Yeah, that's, uh, the second floor [The laptop screen changes to footage of DICK ROMAN alone at his desk], and – and then – what's that?


DEAN
What the hell? Is that Dick?


The laptop screen now shows footage of DICK ROMAN walking along a hallway.


SAM
And that's Dick.


DEAN
Son of a bitch.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – NIGHT


DICK ROMAN, POLLY, and the LEVIATHAN minding her are standing at the front of the board room.


DICK ROMAN
So, genetic propensity for these three cancers – zapped. She's too stoned to care. Polly, take off your dress. [She does so.] She's a slip of a thing, isn't she? And she eats like a linebacker. Bottom line – we're not making art. We want to engineer the perfect beast. We want meat, and these zippy little hummingbirds have to be bred out fast.


The LEVIATHAN next to POLLY holds a syringe containing white liquid.


DICK ROMAN
Additive 3.0. [The LEVIATHAN hands the syringe to DICK ROMAN.] Keep in mind, the stuff we're shipping – a little diluted, longer-acting.


DICK ROMAN inject the liquid into POLLY’s arm. She makes only a soft noise of pain. After a few moments, she starts to gurgle and white liquid spills from her mouth. Her eyes roll back in her head and she falls to the ground. She convulses and then lies still.


DICK ROMAN
Additive 3.0 targets only the characteristics we want to breed out.


DICK ROMAN shows a slide:


Liquidation Index

• Low body mass

• Vertically challenged

• Hemophilia

• IQ > 150


DICK ROMAN
It'll be added in nondairy creamer and multivitamins. First shipment heads to Los Angeles tomorrow. So watch those dysentery reports. And stop by the lab before you go, 'cause those creamer cups are just adorable.


EXT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – NIGHT


DEAN and SAM are still sitting in their car.


DEAN
Cycle through again.


A pick-up pulls up across the street. SAM looks at it through binoculars. The MAID possessed by BOBBY gets out. We see a flashback of SAM running into the cart pushed by the MAID in 7.22 There Will Be Blood.


SAM
That's the maid from the motel.


DEAN
What motel?


SAM watches through binoculars as the MAID heads for the Sucrocorp building.


SAM
Oh, no. Oh, Bobby, what are you doing?


DEAN
Wait. Are you saying that Bobby –


SAM
Look, just, uh, wait here.


DEAN
Are you out of your mind?


SAM
You got the weapon, and – and eyes on Dick, plural. I'll take care of Bobby. [He gets out of the car.]


DEAN
Sam! Hey!


SAM
Shut up.


SAM runs after the MAID.


ACT THREE
EXT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – NIGHT


The MAID walks around the back of the building. SAM appears in front of her.


SAM
Bobby? I know you're in there. Listen to me. There are cameras everywhere. [He points to a security camera.] There's one right there. Stop, okay? You're gonna get her killed.


The MAID pushes SAM and he falls backwards onto the ground. We see the security footage of the parking area behind the building in black and white.


SAM
Bobby! Damn it! [SAM scrambles to his feet.] How are you gonna kill Dick, huh? You can't!


The MAID takes out a large knife.


MAID
Good enough for me.


The MAID slashes at SAM with the knife. He glances up at the moving security camera, grabs the MAID and ducks behind a parked vehicle.


SAM
No! I'm not letting you go.


MAID
Get out of here, Sam.


SAM
No.


The MAID slams SAM against the vehicle and grips him by the throat. SAM chokes and the MAID’s face contorts with the effort of strangling him.


SAM
Bobby, stop. Stop.


BOBBY sees his reflection in the vehicle’s window.


BOBBY
No!


The MAID lets SAM go. BOBBY leaves her body and disappears. The MAID falls to the ground. SAM gasps for a moment, then picks her up.


INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


DEAN is sitting with his hands clasped, looking at the flask. SAM is on the phone.


SAM
Okay, thanks.


SAM hangs up. MEG is drinking a beer.


SAM
She's fine. Checking out of the hospital tonight.


CASTIEL
Well, that's positive. [He holds out a plate containing a sandwich to SAM.]


MEG
Tell me again why you turned tail for some maid. [CASTIEL puts a sandwich in front of DEAN.] You were right there.


DEAN
Shut up, Meg.


SAM
Because Dick made more Dicks. [CASTIEL and DEAN look at him.] He must've kept a chunk of the original Dick Roman somewhere. Uh, they'd all have to touch it.


CASTIEL is drying dishes.


DEAN
Hey, shifty, what's your problem?


CASTIEL
Do we need a cat? Doesn't this place feel one species short?


DEAN
You got anything to say on the topic of Dicks? Crowley was pretty sure that you could help.


CASTIEL
I can't help. You understand? I can't. I destroyed... everything, and I will destroy everything again. Can we please just leave it at that?


DEAN
No. [He gets up.] No, we can't.


SAM
Dean...


DEAN
We can't leave it. You let these friggin' things in. So you don't get to make a sandwich. You don't get a damned cat. Nobody cares that you're broken, Cas. Clean up your mess!


CASTIEL puts down the dish he is holding and walks over to DEAN.


CASTIEL
You know... we should play Twister.


SAM and DEAN look at each other. CASTIEL disappears.


MEG
Nice. You scared off the Empire's only hope.


DEAN
Meaning?


MEG
It occur to you every one of those things was in Cas? He knows them. He can see past the meat suits.


SAM
So, he'll be able to spot the real... fake Dick Roman.


MEG
Gold star, sugarpants. Too bad he's Fruit Loops. You might've had a chance.


DEAN hears a noise behind him and turns. CASTIEL is playing Twister on the floor.


EXT. RUFUS’S CABIN – NIGHT


INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – NIGHT


DEAN is looking at footage from the Sucrocorp office on the laptop.


DEAN
There's no real point in looking for a tell. They all downloaded Dick's brain. They've all got the same tells.


SAM
All right, then maybe the question is, what would the real Dick be doing?


BOBBY appears.


BOBBY
Is that the best you can do? Idjits.


SAM
Bobby. We didn't know if you’d, uh –


BOBBY
Well, you should've. You got the flask. Dumb. You should've burned it right off.


DEAN
Bobby –


BOBBY
I'm still jonesing to go back... grab some poor bastard, kamikaze 'em going after Dick. It's bad.


The laptop plays a news interview with DICK ROMAN.


DICK ROMAN
America is for go-getters. Folks who get off their butts and make it happen.


DEAN closes the laptop.


BOBBY
Let's be real. [to SAM] I damn near killed you. And that woman.


SAM
It wasn't your fault, Bobby – not really.


BOBBY
Right. That's just what ghosts turn into. I really bet the farm I could outsmart that.


DEAN
So, what's it feel like?


BOBBY
What? Going vengeful? It's an itch you can't scratch out. Look... I'm done. Go get Dick. But don't do it 'cause you think it'll scratch the itch. Do it 'cause it's the job. And when it's your time... go.


SAM and DEAN look sadly at BOBBY.


CUT TO: a close-up of burning coals.


SAM and DEAN share a long look with BOBBY.


BOBBY
Here's to... running into you guys on the other side. Only... not too soon. All right?


DEAN tosses the flask (minus its leather cover) onto the coals. It slowly melts. We see the light from BOBBY burning up reflected on DEAN and SAM’s faces. The flask continues to melt and the light goes out. DEAN and SAM look sadly at each other. CASTIEL watches from the stairs.


ACT FOUR
INT. RUFUS’S CABIN – DAY


CASTIEL is playing Uno at the table. DEAN walks over to him.


DEAN
Cas, I need a wingman.


CASTIEL
Dean...


DEAN
You don't want to jump into the jaws of death, that's... fine. How about we run a little errand?


INT. BARN – DAY


Inside the barn we can see a boat and a vehicle is covered with a tarp. We hear the sound of angel wings and then see DEAN and CASTIEL standing near the covered vehicle.


DEAN
Thanks for the lift.


CASTIEL
My pleasure. [DEAN starts towards the vehicle.] Dean...


DEAN
[turning back to CASTIEL] Cas, we've been over it. I get it – you can't help.


CASTIEL
If we attack Dick and fail, then you and Sam die heroically, correct?


DEAN
I don't know. I guess.


CASTIEL
And at best, I die trying to fix my own stupid mistake. Or... I don't die – I'm brought back again. I see now. It's a punishment resurrection. It's worse every time.


DEAN
I'm sorry. Uh, we're talking about God crap, right?


CASTIEL
I'm not good luck, Dean.


DEAN
Yeah, but you know what? Bottom of the ninth, and you're the only guy left on the bench... Sorry, but I'd rather have you, cursed or not. And anyway, nut up, all right? We're all cursed. I seem like good luck to you? [CASTIEL stares at DEAN.] What?


CASTIEL
Well, I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I detect a note of forgiveness.


DEAN
Yeah, well, I'm probably gonna die tomorrow, so...


CASTIEL
Well, I'll go with you. And I'll do my best.


DEAN smiles slightly and nods.


DEAN
Thanks.


CASTIEL
So... can I ask the plan?


DEAN
Well, according to Crowley, Dick knows we're coming, so we're gonna announce ourselves – big.


EXT. ROAD – DAY


A vehicle approaches from a distance. As it gets closer, we see that it is the IMPALA. Steppenwolf’s “Born to be Wild” begins to play. We see close-ups of various parts of the car.


♪ Get your motor runnin' ♪


The IMPALA skids slightly after turning a corner.


♪ Head out on the highway ♪

♪ Lookin' for adventure ♪


The IMPALA skids again rounding the corner towards security boom gates.


♪ in whatever comes our way ♪


The IMPALA crashes through the security boom gates and skids again.


♪ Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen ♪

♪ Take the world in a love embrace ♪

♪ Fire all your guns at once ♪


The IMPALA heads directly for Sucrocorp’s main sign.


♪ and explode into space ♪


The IMPALA crashes through the sign, coming to a stop in a shower of breaking glass. Three LEVIATHANS with guns come out of the Sucrocorp building. MEG gets out of the driver’s seat of the IMPALA. The LEVIATHANS shoot at the IMPALA, breaking the driver’s side window, and at MEG. MEG carries a bottle of Power Clean and a long knife.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


SAM enters the building through a door marked “Exit.”


EXT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


MEG grunts as bullets hit her in the chest.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


DEAN and CASTIEL look around a corner in the building and then walk down a hallway.


CUT TO: SAM opening a door to Room 427.


EXT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


MEG throws Power Clean onto the face of one of the LEVIATHANS. He screams in pain.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


SAM comes out of Room 427 and walks down the hallway.


EXT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


Two LEVIATHANS are lying decapitated on the ground. MEG is splattered with black goo. MEG watches as a third LEVIATHAN’s face burns, then cuts off his head.


MEG
Later, ho nuggets.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


DEAN looks around a corner at DICK ROMAN sitting at the head of the board room table. He motions for CASTIEL, who is behind him, to look. CASTIEL does so and shakes his head.


EXT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


MEG is walking outside the building. Two DEMONS appear behind her. One of the DEMONS flings out an arm and MEG flies backwards and slides along the ground. She sits up.


DEMON
The King of Hell will see you now.


INT. SUCROCORP OFFICE – DAY


SAM bursts open a closed office door. KEVIN is bound to a chair and gagged.


SAM
Kevin. Hey, buddy. We got to hustle, okay?


SAM cuts KEVIN free and KEVIN removes the tape over his mouth.


KEVIN
Wait. We can't leave yet.


SAM
Uh, yeah, we can. It's okay. We got to go.


KEVIN
You don't understand. Dick's got creamer in his lab. He's gonna kill all the skinny people.


SAM
Wait. What? Slow down.


KEVIN
We have to blow up the lab, Sam. Please.


SAM looks around in indecision.


SAM
Yeah, fine. Let's go.


CUT TO: DICK ROMAN holding up a creamer in the lab.


DICK ROMAN
You know, I think this might end up the slickest little genocide in history.


A LEVIATHAN next to him is packing creamers into a box.


LEVIATHAN
Thank you, sir.


DICK ROMAN
Just sayin'. I smell "promotion."


DICK ROMAN takes a few steps across the room and drinks the creamer. There is a noise behind him and he turns. The LEVIATHAN is lying decapitated on the floor. DEAN and CASTIEL stand over him, CASTIEL carrying a bottle of Power Clean and DEAN a machete.


DICK ROMAN
Little abrupt... but okay.


DEAN sheathes the machete.


DICK ROMAN
Castiel. Good to see you again. Thanks for the ride into paradise.


DEAN takes out a bloodstained bone that is sharpened to a point at one end.


DICK ROMAN
And good on you! Pulling that together – A-plus.


DEAN
Oh, you don't think this'll work, do you? You trust that demon?


DICK ROMAN
You sure I'm even me, Dean?


DEAN
No. But he is. [DICK ROMAN looks at CASTIEL.] See, here's the thing when dealing with Crowley – he will always find a way to bone you.


DICK ROMAN
This meeting's over.


CASTIEL moves towards DICK ROMAN, but DICK ROMAN grabs him and flings him into a wall. DEAN plunges the bone into DICK ROMAN’s chest. DICK ROMAN gasps, but then pulls the bone out and snaps it in two.


DICK ROMAN
Did you really think you could trump me?


DEAN
Honestly? [He takes another bone out of his jacket.] No.


CASTIEL pulls DICK ROMAN’s head back. DEAN plunges the bone sideways through DICK ROMAN’s neck. DICK ROMAN yells. SAM and KEVIN run into the room. DICK ROMAN continues to yell and gurgle.


DEAN
Figured we'd have to catch you off guard.


DICK ROMAN’s face transforms into the Leviathan enormous mouth with long pointed teeth and a protruding tongue. He roars briefly before his face returns to normal. He grunts and black goo starts to run from his nose. Waves of energy begin to pulsate from his body in time with a loud, accelerating heartbeat. The energy then appears to concentrate back in his body. SAM flings up an arm to cover his face and KEVIN as DICK ROMAN explodes into black goo.

ACT FIVE
INT. SUCROCORP LAB – DAY


SAM is still sheltering KEVIN. He straightens up and looks around the room, which is splattered with black goo.


KEVIN
Sam, we should go.


SAM
What the hell?


KEVIN
More chompers any second, Sam.


CROWLEY
Not to worry. I have a small army of demons outside. Cut off the head, and the body will flounder, after all. Think if you'd had just one king since before the first sunrise. You'd be in a kerfuffle, too.


SAM
Which is exactly what you wanted.


CROWLEY
So did you. Without a master plan, the Levis are just another monster. Hard to stomp, sure, but you love a challenge. Your job is to keep them from organizing.


SAM
Where's Dean?


CROWLEY
That bone... has a bit of a kick. God weapons often do. They should put a warning on the box.


SAM
Where are they, Crowley?!


CROWLEY
Can't help you, Sam.


CROWLEY snaps his fingers and the two DEMONS who accosted MEG appear on either side of KEVIN.


CROWLEY
Sorry, Sam. Prophet's mine.


CROWLEY snaps his fingers and KEVIN and the DEMONS disappear.


CROWLEY
You got what you wanted – Dick's dead, saved the world. So I want one little prophet. Sorry, moose. Wish I could help. You certainly got a lot on your plate right now. It looks like you are well and truly... on your own.


We hear another snap of fingers. SAM looks around the empty room.


EXT. FOREST – NIGHT


DEAN is lying on the ground.


CASTIEL
Wake up. [DEAN opens his eyes and sits up.] Good. We need to get out of here.


DEAN stands up.


DEAN
Where are we?


CASTIEL
You don't know?


DEAN
Last I remember, we ganked Dick.


CASTIEL
And where would he go in death?


DEAN
Wait. Are you telling me...?


CASTIEL
Every soul here is a monster. [There is a rustling in the trees.] This is where they come to prey upon each other for all eternity.


DEAN
We're in Purgatory? How do we get out?


CASTIEL
I'm afraid we're much more likely to be ripped to shreds.


DEAN turns and sees two large creatures with red eyes watching him.


DEAN
Cas, I think we better –


CASTIEL has disappeared.


DEAN
Cas?


DEAN looks around the dark, desolate forest and hears the rustling of the watching monsters.
