TEASER

[June 21, 2003 - A young COLE wakes up in bed hearing sounds of a struggle downstairs. He leaves his room following the sounds of fighting. He sees a body on the ground downstairs and as he gets closer recognizes it.]

YOUNG COLE [as he rushes down the stairs, slipping on a pool of blood at the bottom]

Dad? Dad. [his father's throat is cut] Dad?!

[He starts to cry]

Daddy.

[Around the corner comes a figure with a bloody knife. The camera pans up to see it is DEAN]

[COLE is in the barn recounting the story to SAM who is still tied up.]

COLE

And that was the night that Dean Winchester murdered my father. And that's... that's why he's gonna die.

SAM

I'm sorry.

COLE

I'm not looking for your sympathy, Sammy. I'm looking for your brother. So, why don't you tell me where Dean-o is, and then I'll let you go.

SAM

That's not gonna happen.

COLE

Really? Now, you know your brother gave me the, uh, green light to put one between your eyes, right?

SAM

Dean...Dean isn't Dean right now. Now, look, I don't know who you are --

COLE

Name's Cole. Listen, Sam...Every night...since I was 13 years old...Every night, I close my eyes and all I can see is your brother and all that blood...and my daddy. Now...I know Dean's family and all, but he gave you up. And you have no reason to protect him -- none. So help me. Please.

SAM

Look, I'm sorry about your dad. Whatever happened... Dean had a reason. I don't know how to tell you this. There are monsters out there.

COLE

You don't think I know that? I did two tours in Iraq. Special Ops, Darfur...The Congo. I've seen suicide bombers and child soldiers so hopped up on speed that they could barely talk! Oh, but they could sure as hell shoot an A.K.

SAM

Not that kind of monster.

COLE

Don't tell me about monsters! 'Cause I've met my share.

SAM

I mean vampires! All right? Werewolves. Monster... monsters. Look in the bag. [motioning with his head to his duffel sitting to the side] Go on. Take a look. It's right there.

COLE [pulling a flask of Holy Water out]

I guess even psychos need to hydrate.

SAM

It's holy water.

COLE [rolling his eyes]

Holy cow.

SAM

Look, I'm not a psycho. And I'm not lying.

COLE

Well, you see, that's exactly what a psycho liar would say, so... See my dilemma?

[COLE sets his own backpack on the table and pulls out a ball peen hammer.]

I guess...We are just gonna have to do this the other way.

TITLE CARD

ACT ONE

[Interior of a strip club in Kill Deer, North Dakota: DEAN is watching a pole dancer and he is drinking. He reaches up and touches her. She slaps his hand away.]

DANCER

No touching. House rules.

DEAN

You sure about that?

[DEAN pulls a $20 bill out of his wallet and lays it on the stage. He dares her with his eyes.]

Go ahead. Pick it up.

DANCER [disgusted moves to leave]

And we're done.

DEAN [grabbing her]

Hey, hey, hey. Song's not over, sweetheart.

SECURITY [intervening]

Time to go, jerkwad.

[Scenes switch between DEAN beating up SECURITY and COLE torturing SAM]

COLE [punching SAM in the face]

Where's Dean, Sam? Where is he?

[DEAN is mercilessly beating the SECURITY guard]

COLE [punching SAM in the face again

Where is he?!

[DEAN beats the SECURITY guard unconscious and then kicks him for good measure. Then DEAN finishes his drink and picks his $20 bill up from the stage]

[COLE chokes SAM with his right hand and pushes torturously on his injured shoulder with his left. SAM screams in agony.]

SAM [gasping]

Shove it up your ass.

COLE [releasing SAM]

Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. I guess it's time to crank up the volume, then. Huh?

[COLE pulls the hammer back out and taps it on SAM's left knee, getting ready to swing. SAM is shaking in pain but tries to steel himself for COLE's blow.]

Right there.

[COLE's phone rings]

COLE

Ain't you lucky, boy?

[He answers it and walks outside]

Hey, darling. No, I'm good. No, everything's fine. Everything's just fine.

[SAM realizes when COLE pulled the phone out of his pocket he pulled out his keys too. And on his keyring is a pocket knife. SAM looks to make sure COLE has stepped out of the barn.]

COLE

Go ahead. Put him on. Hey. Hey, big guy. How you doing? Now, no, no. Listen, daddy's really busy right now, okay? I love you. All right, I got to go, okay? I'm gonna have to call you back.

[COLE re-enters the barn but the chair is tipped over and SAM is gone.]

[DEAN leaves the strip club and runs into a few teenage boys. One bumps into him.]

BOY

Move, grandpa.

CROWLEY [appearing]

Kids. Am I right? In my day, we respected our elders. Of course, back then, anyone over 30 was ancient. Now 40-year-olds are still living with mommy, lying on OkCupid, and taking pictures of their food.

DEAN

What do you want, Crowley?

CROWLEY

A chat. We need to talk about your... Anger-management issues.

[Scene changes to CASTIEL washing his hands in a sink on a dock. He tries to heal his chest wound himself but his grace flickers out.]

HANNAH [approching]

Here. Let me.

CASTIEL

Thank you. Hannah, you don't have to --you -- you can go. You don't owe me anything.

HANNAH

I know. But I want to stay...and help.

[CASTIEL chuckles]

Is that wrong?

CASTIEL

No. It's just...very human. It's a compliment.

HANNAH

Oh.

[CASTIEL's phone rings and he answers it]

Sam.

SAM [walking down a rural road]

You need to get to Beulah, North Dakota -- now.

CASTIEL

I do?

SAM

Yes. Crowley and Dean were there. We got to pick up their trail.

CASTIEL

Good. Great.

SAM

Yeah, um...not so much. Cas...Dean's a demon.

CASTIEL

Dean's a demon? How?

SAM

The Mark --I-I guess it --it just messed him up. I don't know.

CASTIEL

That is a vast understatement.

SAM

Right. Now, Cas, listen. I know you're not feeling so hot, but this is kind of an “all hands on deck” situation here, so...

CASTIEL

So... I'll meet you there.

SAM

Yeah.

[SAM looks ahead and sees a truck sitting at an abandoned house]

[CASTIEL and HANNAH are driving down a road at night]

HANNAH

Are you sure about this?

CASTIEL

If you wanted to stay behind...

HANNAH

I didn't. I just...Castiel...I think the Winchesters are a bad influence on you.

CASTIEL

Sam and Dean may be a bit rough around the edges, but they're the best men I've ever known. And they're my friends.

HANNAH [looking out the window at the night sky]

I never get tired of looking at them. All those stars.

[As she talks CASTIEL nods off in the driver's seat. He is awoke by the horn of an oncoming semi-truck and he swerves to miss it. His car slides into a ditch.]

ACT TWO

[DEAN and CROWLEY are sitting at a bar. DEAN motions to the bartender]

DEAN

Two shots here. He'll have something fancy, with your tiniest umbrella.

CROWLEY

So...How you been feeling? On edge? Pent-up? Unfulfilled?

DEAN

You sound like a Viagra commercial. You know that, right?

CROWLEY

This isn't about...Little Dean. It's about the Mark. It changed you.

DEAN [flashing black eyes]

I've noticed.

CROWLEY

And I know that you want to keep the party going. You want to have fun, fun, fun till daddy takes the black eyes away. The fact is...you need to kill now. Not want to, not choose to --need to.

BARTENDER [setting DEAN's shots down and some girly drink in front of CROWLEY]

There you go.

CROWLEY [with a withering look]

Danke.

Face it, darling. You're an addict. Death is your drug. And you're gonna spend the rest of your life chasing that dragon.

DEAN

So?

CROWLEY

So...I'm here to facilitate.

DEAN

You want me to kill for you.

CROWLEY

I want you to kill for us. Look...You're going to snap eventually. The anger, the bloodlust is gonna build up in you until you can't take it anymore, and then... So, the question is, do you want to spike a civilian or someone who has it coming?

DEAN

Like who?

CROWLEY

Like...Mindy Morris. Caring mother...Loving wife...Cheating trollop. After her husband, Lester, discovered Mindy's liaison amoureuse, heated words were exchanged. In the end, Mindy wanted a divorce...And 50% of everything. But Lester --

DEAN

Lester would rather give up his soul than half his junk.

CROWLEY

We live in a very materialistic world. Mindy's gonna die one way or the other. Why not take the job -- feed the beast?

DEAN

Fine. One-time deal.

CROWLEY

Oh, there's something else that I need to share with you.

[CASTIEL and HANNAH get out of a towtruck and the driver gets out too. She seems very kind and friendly]

DRIVER

I'm gonna have to run in to town for a new set of tires. Could take a while. You want to head inside and watch TV or something, you're more than welcome. Oh, and there's leftover three-bean surprise in the fridge, if you're hungry.

HANNAH [impressed]

You're very kind.

DRIVER

Well, makes up for me being an ax murderer and all. Uh, sorry. Kidding.

HANNAH

Ah, I see.

CASTIEL

Thank you for everything.

[Inside the house, HANNAH opens the fridge and CASTIEL takes off his trench coat and lies down on the couch. HANNAH pulls the casserole from the fridge.]

HANNAH

I understand the three beans, but...What's the surprise?

[She walks into the other room and sees that CASTIEL has fallen asleep. She gently lays his trench coat over him.]

[DEAN is at LESTER's house watching MINDY MORRIS through the window. Just as he is about to make his move he is distracted by headlights turning in. Scene changes to LESTER sitting in the car waiting. Suddenly DEAN opens the passenger door and gets in.]

LESTER

Hey! Hey!

DEAN

Let me guess -- Lester?

LESTER

I...Who are you?

DEAN [eyes flashing black]

Who do you think?

LESTER

Whoa. Ohh!

DEAN [mockingly]

“Ohh.”

What the hell are you doing here, man?

LESTER

Well, my contact...Yeah, he, uh -- he told me that, uh, this was happening, so I just wanted to come down and make sure it gets done right.

DEAN

Ah. 'Cause you're the expert, huh? Listen --and this is murder 101 --when you hire someone to kill your wife, you don't want to be around when the hit goes down. It's called an alibi.

LESTER

Yeah, I know what an alibi is. I watch “Franklin & Bash”.

DEAN

Super. Listen, you sold your soul for this crap, so --

LESTER

It's not crap. It's my life. And she flushed it down the toilet.

DEAN

Les... I'm gonna say something to you. I need you to really listen to me. You're a loser. Your lady in there -- she's a North Dakota 8. You're a 4 1/2, Max. Now, I don't blame her for stepping out -- especially if she found you were messing around first.

LESTER

No. Oh, no. I-I wasn't...Uh -- How do you know?

DEAN

Well, you just got that, uh, pervy, “I'd do anything to nail my secretary” look.

LESTER

Oh. No. T-that -- it's different when guys do it.

DEAN

Really?

LESTER

Yeah. It's called “science”.

DEAN

Oh.

LESTER

Men aren't built for monogamy...because of evolution. We're -- we're -- we're programmed, you know, to --to spread our seed.

[DEAN punches him]

LESTER

Ohh! Ow!

DEAN

Like I said -- loser, with a capital “L,” rhymes with “you suck.”

LESTER

Yeah, well, you're a punk-ass demon! And you work for me now. So get in there and do your job, you freak!

DEAN [fixing an icy glare at LESTER]

And what are you gonna do? You gonna watch, huh? Is that what you like to do, Lester? Watch? Well, watch this.

[DEAN pulls out the First Blade and buries it in LESTER's chest.]

[SAM is showing DEAN's picture to the SECURITY GUARD who DEAN beat up. The guy has a black eye and has an arm in a sling.]

SECURITY GUARD

Hmm. That's the guy. I called 911, but he was gone before they showed up. That dude get to you, too?

SAM [looking at his own sling]

Oh, uh, no. This is, uh, just a...hunting accident.

SECURITY GUARD

Damn.

SAM

Yeah. Would you do me a favor? If you do see him again, will you give me a call?

SECURITY GUARD

Yeah. You bet.

SAM

Thanks.

[SAM gets in his stolen truck and pulls out of the parking lot. COLE is watching him from his own vehicle and pulls out to follow him.]

ACT THREE

[CASTIEL wakes up to find the tow-truck driver's young daughter sitting at the end of the couch eating cereal and watching cartoons.]

DAUGHTER

Hello.

CASTIEL

Hi.

DAUGHTER

Did you have a good dream?

CASTIEL

Well...I, uh...I don't really dream.

DAUGHTER

Why? One time, I dreamed that my snot was a rocket, and it shot into space and knocked down the stars to make room for more rockets!

CASTIEL [smiling at the little girl]

That sounds like some very special snot.

[She giggles joyously]

TOW-TRUCK DRIVER [enters]

All right, you're good to go.

HANNAH

We appreciate that.

TOW-TRUCK DRIVER

Great guy you have there.

HANNAH

Oh. We're not... That.

TOW-TRUCK DRIVER

Too bad.

[CROWLEY is listening to a boring progress report from a stunt demon. He looks immensely bored.]

STUNT DEMON #1

At the end of the day, we have to strategically calibrate expectations. And so, by making these 64 small changes...I believe we can increase our demon-conversion rate by 0.03%.

[Phone rings and STUNT DEMON #2 picks it up]

Uh, sir?

Sir?

CROWLEY

Kill me.

STUNT DEMON #2

Uh... It's Sam Winchester, sir. He's close.

[DEAN enters]

CROWLEY

Dean! How did it go?

DEAN

Fine. Fine. Uh... He's dead, and you're right --I-I feel amazing.

CROWLEY

“He”?

DEAN

Uh, Lester.

CROWLEY

The client? You killed the client?

DEAN

Does it matter? He was a douche. Now he's a dead douche.

CROWLEY

Of course it matters! The deal was one dead wife for one soul. The wife's not dead, I don't get the soul. It's math.

DEAN [turning to leave]

Well...There you go.

CROWLEY

Hey! don't turn your back on me!

[DEAN turns around with cold eyes and with one shove sends CROWLEY sprawling on the floor. DEAN chuckles coldly.]

CROWLEY

Is something funny?

STUNT DEMON #2

No, sir.

CROWLEY [getting up]

Good.

What do you think you're doing?

DEAN

Oh, whatever I want.

CROWLEY

Really? Because I think you don't know what you want. Tell me, Dean -- what are you? A demon? If so, why isn't Lester's wife dead? Did you feel sorry for her? So maybe you're human. Except you have those pretty black peepers and you're working alongside me. Why don't you do us all a great big favor and PICK A BLOODY SIDE?!

DEAN

Or what? Hmm? Go ahead. Make a move. See how it ends. I ain't your friggin' bestie, and I ain't taking orders from you. When I need to kill, I'll call. Until then, stay out of my way.

CROWLEY

Fine. It's over. What can I say? Crazy ones -- well, they're good for a fling, but they're not relationship material.

DEAN

Are you done?

CROWLEY

We're done. You know what, Dean? It's not me. It's you.

[CROWLEY and his stunt demons leave the bar]

[CASTIEL and HANNAh go to get in the fixed car.]

HANNAH

Maybe I should drive?

CASTIEL

All right. Good idea.

[SAM is leaving a hotel when someone calls to him]

CROWLEY

Hello, Bullwinkle. You miss me?

SAM

So much.

CROWLEY

You're here for Dean. I'm here to give him to you.

SAM

What?

CROWLEY

The little prat's bad for business. He's...uncontrollable. Must be the Mark. Anyway, Dean's your problem now -- again, forever.

SAM [desperately]

Then where is he?

CROWLEY

First, there's the small matter of my finder's fee.

[CASTIEL wakes up in the car with HAHHAH missing. He gets out and discovers he is parked at a playground]

CASTIEL

Hannah?!

ANGEL [guarding the portal]

She's gone, Castiel. She took the express elevator upstairs.

CASTIEL

To heaven? Why?

[HANNAH approaches METATRON's prison cell. He is in a straightjacket.]

METATRON

Mm. Hello, beautiful.

HANNAH

Metatron.

METATRON

I knew you'd come back. That white-hot spark between us -- I felt it.

HANNAH

I'm here about Castiel.

METATRON

Boo.

HANNAH

After you cast the spell to close the Gates of Heaven, was there any of his Grace left?

METATRON

And if there was?

HANNAH

Then I want it.

METATRON

Well...Everybody wants something. Question is, are you willing to pay for it? Are you willing to...I don't know -- let me out?

Oh, come on. don't look so shocked. You knew what I'd ask for. And you wouldn't have come here if you weren't willing to pony up.

HANNAH

It doesn't make it any easier.

METATRON

Fair enough. So... Let me sweeten the pot. I have had time to... think. And I've decided -- screw earth. You pop that lock, I'll give you Castiel's Grace and then scamper off to another planet -- another galaxy, even --and you will never see me again. And in return... you get Cas back at full power -- large and in charge. And that's what you really want, isn't it? Somebody big and strong telling you what to do. Poor little Hannah. You're so desperate to be dominated.

[HANNAH grabs him through the bars and smashes his face into the bars]

Ow!

HANNAH

Watch your mouth.

METATRON

Ah. Like I said -- white-hot spark. So, do we have a deal?

CASTIEL

No. What are you doing?

METATRON

Ugh. You know perfectly well what she's doing, ass-tiel.

HANNAH

I had to. You are dying.

METATRON

She's right. You totally are.

CASTIEL

You shut up!

HANNAH

He said your Grace -- it's still out there.

CASTIEL

He's lying. He is a liar.

METATRON

Hey, words hurt!

CASTIEL

Listen to me, Hannah. You don't want this. I have seen what -- I've made deals born of desperation, and they always end in blood and tears -- always.

HANNAH

So I'm supposed to let you...

CASTIEL

Yes. It's my life, and it's my choice. And I don't want this.

HANNAH

I...You're right. I'm sorry.

[HANNAH leaves]

METATRON

You're wrong. Not about the lying part. I am a terrific liar. But there is some of your mojo left. Not a lot... But enough. And it can be yours for the low, low price of --

CASTIEL

Keep it.

METATRON

Seriously?

CASTIEL

I've made peace with my fate.

METATRON

Who's the liar now?

CASTIEL

I enjoy thinking about you locked up in here, rotting until the end of time. It's my...happy place.

METATRON

Yeah? Uh...No. I'll get out. It may take a century. May take a millennium or two, but this dump will not hold me forever. And when I'm free -- here's a little sneak preview -- everybody dies.

CASTIEL

You... You talk too much.

[CASTIEL turns and walks out of the prison]

METATRON [yelling after him]

You should have killed me when you had the chance, Castiel. Dead man walking! You heard me! Dead man walking!!

[DEAN is sitting at a piano in the bar. He plays a few notes but his mind is elsewhere. He takes out the First Blade and slices open his left palm. It instantly heals. In DEAN's mind he hears CROWLEY yell "Pick a bloody side!!" Suddenly in the background we see SAM slowly step into frame as he sees his brother from the first time.]

DEAN

Hiya, Sam.

ACT FOUR

[INTERIOR BAR]

DEAN

Hey, Harv, why don't you go grab a smoke?

[to SAM]

Who winged you?

SAM

Does it matter?

DEAN

Not really. I told you to let me go.

SAM

You know I can't do that. By the way, your, uh, pal Crowley...Sold you out.

DEAN

Sounds like him.

SAM

Dean, hold on a second. You don't have to do this. Look, we know how to cure demons. You remember that?

DEAN

Little Latin, lot of blood. It rings a bell. Did you ever stop to think that if I wanted to be cured, I wouldn't have bailed?

SAM

That was Crowley.

DEAN [smiling]

It really wasn't.

SAM

It doesn't matter, all right? 'Cause whatever went down, whatever happened, we will fix it.

DEAN

Will we? 'Cause right now, I'm doing all I can not to come over there and rip your throat out... with my teeth. I'm giving you a chance, Sam. You should take it.

SAM

I'm gonna have to pass.

DEAN

Well, I'm not walking out that door with you. I'm just not. So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna kill me?

SAM

No.

DEAN

Why? You don't know what I've done. I might have it coming.

SAM

Well, I don't care. Because you are my brother. And I'm here to take you home.

DEAN

Hmm. Ah! [mockingly] “You're my brother, and I'm here to take you home.” Yeah, what is this, a Lifetime movie? Huh? With your puppy-dog eyes? [laughing] Oh, thanks, Sammy. I needed that.

[SAM takes out the sigil etched handcuffs]

DEAN

You really think those are gonna work?

SAM

There's one way to find out.

[Just then, tear gas comes flying in the window and SAM dissolves in a fit of coughing. He stumbles outside where COLE is waiting to knock him unconscious. DEAN appears behind COLE]

COLE [pulling his gun on DEAN]

Wow. It's really you.

DEAN

We met?

COLE

Talked on the phone.

DEAN

Right. Right. You're the guy who's supposed to put a bullet in Sammy's brain. Did you miss?

COLE

Well, I had a better idea. I figure if I let your bro escape, he'd go running to you, and all I had to do was just tag along. And now here we are, finally -- Dean Winchester.

DEAN

Great. A groupie.

COLE

You remember me?

DEAN

Yeah, yeah. You're that guy from that thing.

COLE

Nyack, New York, June 21, 2003.

DEAN

That supposed to ring a bell?

COLE

It was the night you gutted and murdered a man by the name of Edward Trenton. He was my father.

DEAN

Okay.

COLE

“Okay”?

DEAN

Well, hey, I'm not saying I didn't slice and dice your old man. I'm just saying that he wasn't the first, and he certainly wasn't the last, and they all just kind of get blended up.

COLE

I saw you...That night...After. You let me live. That was dumb -- real dumb. I spent half my life training for this moment. I've played out this fight a thousand times in my mind. And I know all about you, Dean-o. And you're good. Oh, you're real good. But, you see, I'm better.

DEAN

Prove it. Take a shot.

COLE

Now, that's not payback. [He holsters his gun and draws his knife] This is payback.

[COLE leaps to attack DEAN who fends off his attack easily. COLE attacks him again and DEAN easily pulls the gun from the holster and drops the clip from it and empties the chamber.]

DEAN

You know...And I'm just spitballing here, but, uh, maybe...you are not as good as you think you are.

Oh! You know Kung Fu?

COLE

I know everything.

DEAN

Well, come on.

[COLE attacks him in a fury and DEAN again easily throws him to the ground.]

DEAN

What did you think was gonna happen, huh? You just stroll up here and say “my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die,” And I'd just roll over? Well, that's just -- it makes me sad.

[DEAN leans mockingly over COLE but doesn't see him pull another knife. COLE slashes DEAN's face with it]

Ugh!

[DEAN quickly gets COLE into a throat grip against a car as we see the cut on his face instantly heal]

You have no idea what you walked into here, do you? None.

COLE

What are you?

DEAN

I'm a demon.

[DEAN take out the First Blade and holds it to COLE's throat]

COLE

Do it! You said if you saw me, you would kill me, so do it!

DEAN

I guess I changed my mind.

[DEAN releases COLE and steps back. But at that instant SAM throws holy water on his brother and DEAN starts to burn. SAM rushes in snapping on the sigil etched handcuffs.]

SAM

Stop! It's over! It's over.

[DEAN glares daggers at SAM but is completely helpless.]

ACT FIVE

[Outside the bar, DEAN is handcuffed to the backseat of the IMPALA and SAM and CROWLEY stand outside the car. SAM has the First Blade in his hands]

CROWLEY

A pleasure doing business.

SAM

What are you gonna do with it?

CROWLEY

Toss it into a volcano, leave it on the Moon. I'll get creative. Believe me, I don't want Dean getting his hands on the precious any more than you do. Your brother knows I ratted. He tends to hold a grudge. I don't want to get...Boned.

SAM [handing over the First Blade]

This doesn't make us square. If I see you again --

CROWLEY

Oh, stop it, Samantha. No one likes a tease.

[COLE is in a public library bleeding all over the books. He is gasping in pain as the librarian looks on.]

COLE

Give me every book you have

on demons.

[CROWLEY sits alone at the bar. He is looking at a picture of DEAN and himself.]

STUNT DEMON #1

Sir. It's time to move on.

[CROWLEY nods and they leave the bar]

[SAM is driving the IMPALA toward home and DEAN is quiet in the back]

SAM [looking around the car]

This thing is filthy.

DEAN

It's just a car, Sam.

SAM

“It's just a...car”. Wow. You really have gone dark.

DEAN

You have no idea.

SAM

You know what, Dean? I saw what happened back there. You could have killed that guy, and you didn't. You took mercy on him.

DEAN

You call that mercy? Imagine you spend your whole life hunting down the guy that knifed your father. When you finally find him... He whips you like a dog. How do you think that feels? That kid's gonna spend his whole life knowing that he had his shot and that he couldn't beat me. That ain't mercy. That's the worst thing I could have done to him.

And what I'm gonna do to you, Sammy... Well, that ain't gonna be mercy, either.
