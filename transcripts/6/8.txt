NOW
EXT. HONEY WAGON BAR – NIGHT

Buffalo, New York

A MAN is talking on a cell phone as he walks across the car park in front of the bar.

MAN (on phone)
Did he eat? You gave him a bath, right? Well, did you take him to the park?

Lightning flashes as the MAN reaches his late-model black car.

MAN (on phone)
And did he make pee-pee and poo-poo? Good. Tell him Daddy loves him. Be home soon.

The MAN hangs up. Lightning flashes again and the MAN looks around him. We then see the MAN in black and white through the branches of a bush across the car park. Something pants. The MAN unlocks his car, gets in, puts the key in the ignition and reaches across the passenger seat. The panting gets louder and something that sounds four-legged begins to run towards the car. It snarls. The MAN straightens up.

MAN (on phone)
What the...

The MAN looks horrified. We hear the sound of the creature climbing onto the hood of the car. The MAN puts his hands in front of his face and screams as the windshield shatters. Blood splatters and runs down the driver’s-side window.


SUPERNATURAL (Title Card)

We hear the sound of something four-legged running.


ACT ONE
EXT. FAT MACK’S RIB SHACK – DAY

SAM is eating at an outdoor table. DEAN is standing nearby, talking on his cell phone and holding a plate of ribs.

DEAN (on phone)
I know, Bobby, but there's got to be another way. I don't know. Keep digging. I mean, if Crowley thinks we're just gonna –

CROWLEY
Crowley thinks you're just gonna what, Dean?

CROWLEY has materialized behind DEAN.

CROWLEY
Is that Bobby Singer? Give him a kiss for me.

DEAN (on phone)
I'll call you back.

CROWLEY
Good news, boys! I've got a job for you.

CROWLEY pulls out the chair next to SAM, turns it around and sits on it backwards. DEAN sits across from them.

DEAN
I'm gonna say this once. You can take your job and shove it up your ass.

CROWLEY
Is that any way to talk to your boss?

DEAN
You're not my boss, dickbag.

CROWLEY
Dean, Dean. Been through this. Quit clutching your pearls. You've been working for me for some time now. Sam here, longer.

SAM
We didn't know.

CROWLEY
Like that makes a difference to you. You'd sell your brother for a dollar right now if you really needed a soda.

DEAN looks pained.

CROWLEY
Look, I'm sending you –

DEAN
No.

CROWLEY
Beg pardon?

DEAN
I've done some shady stuff in my time, but I am not doing this. No.

CROWLEY
Ten quid says you will.

CROWLEY touches the back of SAM’s hand. SAM yells and his hand sizzles. A burn spreads on SAM’s hand. SAM gasps in pain.

CROWLEY
You like pain, Sam? You like Hell?

CROWLEY
You need to stop thinking of this as some kind of deal. This is a hostage situation, you arrogant little thug. I own your brother! Do you understand me?

CROWLEY snaps his fingers and the burn on SAM’s hand disappears.

CROWLEY
Come on, Dean, smile. It's not that bad. Here's incentive – you bag me a live alpha, and I'll give you little Sammy's soul back, with a cherry on top.

SAM
What, alpha vamp not good enough for you?

CROWLEY
Best mind where you poke your nose, if you want to keep it. Your merry little hike up the food chain starts here.

CROWLEY puts a newspaper down on the table.

CROWLEY
Businessman found dead in his car – chest ripped open...

SAM picks up the newspaper. The headline reads “Businessman Falls Victim to Animal Attack.”

CROWLEY
...heart missing. Sounds like?

SAM
Werewolf.

DEAN
No, it's not a full moon.

CROWLEY
Werewolves turning on the full moon – so '09.

SAM
He's right. Samuel and I ganked one about six months back on the half-moon. Things have been out of whack for a while now, I guess.

DEAN
Yeah, I guess.

CROWLEY
So, it's settled then. You bag the howler, bring it home to papa. See you soon, boys.

CROWLEY disappears.


EXT. – NIGHT

The IMPALA drives fast along a road.


INT. IMPALA – NIGHT

DEAN is driving.

SAM
So, the vic's a real class act. Owned a bunch of slum-grade apartments. Couple houses, too.

DEAN
So this is it? This is – this is what you're gonna do?

SAM
What am I doing?

DEAN
Crowley. He's so far up our asses we're – we're – we're coughing sulfur, but you – you're just gonna work the case?

SAM
Well, he's got us by the short and curlies. What else are we supposed to do?

DEAN
It's just – you know, man, I... I'm working for a demon now. I don't even know who you are. I just... I just need a second to adjust.

SAM
Look... this is a crap situation. I get it. But, Dean, I am still me – same melon, same memories. I-I still like the same music. I still think about Suzie Heizer.

DEAN
Biology class Suzie Heizer?

SAM
Can you blame me? Look, I know you don't trust me. And I can't take back what I did. But I'm going to prove it to you. I'm still your brother.


EXT. DOCK – DAY

Someone zips up a body bag. DEAN and SAM in their FBI suits walk past a coroner’s vehicle towards a DETECTIVE, who is standing next to the body and two men who are ready to move it.

MAN 1
Okay.

MAN 2
I got it.

The two men lift the body and carry it away. DEAN and SAM show their ID.

DEAN
How you doing? Agents Holt and Wilson.

DETECTIVE
Feds?

SAM
Yeah.

DETECTIVE
What are the Feds doing here?

SAM
Oh, we're specialists. They call us in to answer the questions of mouth-breathing dick monkeys.

DEAN and the DETECTIVE look at SAM.

SAM
So, you gonna walk us through this, or, uh...

DETECTIVE
Dock worker. Guy on the morning shift found him – chest ripped wide open.

DEAN
Same as the body in the car?

DETECTIVE
Yeah, second one in two days.

SAM
Internal organs missing on both vics? Like their hearts?

DETECTIVE
Uh... looks like it, yeah. How'd you know?

SAM
So, this guy, he – he have any enemies?

DETECTIVE
Yeah, plenty, but, uh, I don't think it was a wolf or possibly a cougar that had a beef with the guy. You do realize these were animal attacks?

DEAN
An animal out here. What, you think it came for the sailing?


INT. MOTEL – DAY

DEAN is asleep face down on a bed. He wakes and turns over. We see that he is wearing jeans and slept on top of the covers. DEAN looks at SAM, who is dressed in a shirt and suit pants and is organizing papers at the table.

SAM
Morning.

The other bed is still made and untouched.

DEAN
You didn't sleep. 'Cause you don't... sleep.

SAM
Right.

DEAN
Yeah. That's not creepy at all.

SAM
Not like I can help it. So, you gonna just lay there staring at me...

SAM puts on his suit jacket.

SAM
...or you want to hear what I dug up?

DEAN raises a hand to tell SAM to go ahead.

SAM
All right. So, we know that werewolves are basically id gone wild, right? I mean, whoever they hate, they kill when they wolf out. So, I've been playing connect the victims.

DEAN
And?

SAM puts his paperwork into a briefcase.

SAM
And I think I found a common denominator. So come on. Uh...

SAM tosses DEAN some ID.

SAM
Get the lead out, huh?

DEAN
Let me get dressed, Robocop.


EXT. HOUSE – DAY

The IMPALA pulls up and parks outside a house. SAM gets out carrying a gun, which he puts into the back of his pants. He and DEAN walk to the house and knock. A WOMAN carrying a young boy answers.

WOMAN
Yes, can I help you?

SAM and DEAN show their ID.

SAM
Is Cal Garrigan at home? We've got a few questions we'd like to ask him.

WOMAN
[with a smile] Yeah. Um, come in.


INT. HOUSE – DAY

The WOMAN sets the boy down in the kitchen and hands him a toy. A German Shepherd is lying on a dog bed.

WOMAN
Honey, um, why don't you go play in your room for a little while, okay?

The WOMAN clears toys from the kitchen table.

WOMAN
Excuse the mess. Please sit.

SAM and DEAN sit at the table.

WOMAN
Um... can I get you guys anything?

DEAN
No, thank you. Um, so Cal is your boyfriend?

WOMAN
That's right.

DEAN
And where is he?

WOMAN
Uh, sleeping, I think.

DEAN
You mind telling him up and at 'em? He's got some guests.

WOMAN
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

The WOMAN starts to leave the room, but stops as CAL clears his throat and enters, with a hand to his head.

WOMAN
Cal...

The German Shepherd growls and barks once.

CAL
Lucky, shh!

The German Shepherd growls again.

WOMAN
These are Agents...

DEAN
Holt and Wilson. Morning... ish.

CAL
Hey. What's this?

DEAN
You out late last night, Cal?

CAL pours himself some coffee.

CAL
Just, uh, you know, a couple beers with friends.

DEAN
How many's a couple?

CAL
I don't know. Three, four tops.

SAM
If all you had was beer, then how come you're sweating vodka? And looks to me like you slept in those clothes. Am I right?

CAL
I don't know. I – I guess.

DEAN
So what you're saying is, you got blind drunk, you blacked out. Something tells me this isn't the first time.

SAM
So, Cal, truthfully, who knows what you've really been up to at night?

CAL
Look, what's this about?

SAM
We're investigating the death of Ronald Garrigan.

CAL
My brother?

CAL and the WOMAN look at each other. She shrugs.

DEAN
Sorry for your loss.

CAL
Yeah, I thought that was some kind of animal attack.

SAM
No love lost between the two of you, huh?

CAL
Look, we had our differences, I guess. You love your brother, of course, but... Ron had a lot of problems. He was, uh, volatile.

SAM
Last time he was here, you called the cops?

CAL
Yeah, look, he came in here all messed up, and he was yelling. He shoved Mandy. So, yeah, I called the cops. I don't see how that has to do with –

SAM
Your landlord was found dead this week. Were you aware of that?

CAL
Saw it in the papers. Why?

SAM
Well, you two were pretty far behind on your rent, right? He had sent eviction papers?

MANDY
I – I'm sorry. That was an animal attack.

SAM
Funny enough, yeah – both of 'em were.

CAL
So, great, great. Yeah, guys. What in the hell do you think I had to do with 'em?

DEAN
Just following procedure. Had to ask. You two have a good day.


EXT. HOUSE – DAY

SAM and DEAN walk towards the IMPALA.

SAM
So, Cal's a prince.

DEAN
Yeah, doesn't even know where he was last night.

SAM
Bag him now?

DEAN
No. We make sure.

SAM
Really?

DEAN
Before we hand him over to a lifetime of demon rape? Yeah, really.

They get into the car and drive away.


EXT. GARAGE – NIGHT

DEAN and SAM in the IMPALA pull up and park near a garage next to a fix-it business, on the other side of a hedge. Men are arriving in their vehicles as the door to the garage rolls up. Someone turns on the lights and we see that the garage is furnished like a bar with a juke box and pool table.

SAM
Boy, Cal just doesn't know when to quit.

DEAN
Three scuzzy bars, one scuzzy strip club, a chili-dog joint, seven or eight nightcaps, and now... scotches in the library. I'm getting cirrhosis just watching this. Other than that, we got squat.

SAM
Let's just see.

The men in the garage are laughing and music is playing. CAL and another man grab pool cues.


EXT. GARAGE BAR – DAY

DEAN and SAM are still watching the garage bar.

DEAN
Dude, sun's up.

Two men leave the garage. Others are sitting around the table.

DEAN
This guy's still on two legs. In theory. He ain't wolfing out.

SAM
Well, not tonight, anyway.

DEAN
Let's head back. We can re-attack this in a couple hours.

DEAN starts the IMPALA and they drive away.


INT. GARAGE BAR – DAY

A man turns off the lights and CAL lowers the roller door. They leave via a side door.


EXT. GARAGE BAR – DAY

The men bump fists in farewell.

CAL
Catch you later, man.

CAL walks to his pick-up. A German Shepherd pads up and sits in front of him.

CAL
Lucky. What are you doing?

LUCKY growls and leaps at CAL.

CAL
No!

CAL is knocked face-down onto the ground.

CAL
No!

CAL screams as he is dragged backwards along his pick-up. Blood splatters the side of the pick-up and there is the sound of flesh tearing. There is the sound of panting and we see CAL in black and white as if through the eyes of a dog. CAL’s chest is ripped open. The picture changes to full color again and we see a shirtless man reflected in the side window of the pick-up. He is breathing heavily. We see the bare, blood-splattered feet and legs of the man standing next to CAL’s body, then the man’s bloodstained face and chest.


INT. CAL AND MANDY’S HOUSE – DAY

MANDY is asleep in bed. The naked man from the previous scene is standing next to the bed looking at her. His face and chest are now clean. There is the sound of something crinkling and shifting. LUCKY jumps up onto the bed, lies down next to MANDY and licks her hand, then turns around and lies with his face near her feet.


ACT TWO
INT. MANDY’S HOUSE – DAY

MANDY wakes. LUCKY licks her face.

MANDY
Oh, ew, Lucky, that's enough. [calls out] Cal? [more quietly] Typical.

MANDY sits up and pats LUCKY.

MANDY
Oh, Lucky. Honestly.

MANDY gives LUCKY a hug.

MANDY
You are the only decent boyfriend I have ever had.

MANDY gets out of bed. We see her walk into the bathroom in black and white, through LUCKY’s eyes. LUCKY jumps off the bed and sits in the doorway to the bathroom. He watches MANDY get undressed and step into the shower.


EXT. GARAGE BAR – DAY

CAL’s body is being zipped into a body bag on a wheeled stretcher. DEAN and SAM are in their FBI suits.

DEAN
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it's not Cal.

SAM
Masterful deduction, Sherlock.

DEAN
I mean, a werewolf attack in daylight? This whole thing is just weird.

SAM
Dogs and cats living together – mass hysteria. So, you know this means that we're down to one suspect, right?

DEAN
I know.

SAM
I mean, Mandy is right at the deep end of the vic pool. Can you do it?

DEAN
Do what?

SAM
Shove her in the trunk, serve her up to Crowley.

DEAN
Yeah, Sam, I can do it.


INT. MANDY’S HOUSE – DAY

MANDY’S SON is lying on a couch, covered with a blanket.

MANDY
You still feeling hot, baby?

MANDY’S SON
Mm-hmm.

MANDY
Here, have some juice. Make you feel better.

MANDY’S SON
Okay.

LUCKY trots up carrying a stuffed toy in his mouth and gives the toy to MANDY’S SON.

MANDY
Hey, see? Lucky knows you're not feeling well, and he wants you to feel better.

LUCKY shakes the toy and it squeaks. MANDY’S SON laughs.

MANDY
He loves you, doesn't he? There's a good boy.

MANDY pats LUCKY as LUCKY shakes the toy again.

MANDY
There's a good boy.

MANDY’S SON
He loves a squeak.

MANDY
Yeah.

LUCKY pulls at the toy while MANDY is holding it and a leg comes off in MANDY’s hand.

MANDY
Uh-oh.

MANDY and MANDY’S SON laugh.

MANDY’S SON
The leg broke off.

MANDY
Lucky, look what you did!

[Later]

LUCKY is sitting in front of the television, apparently watching.

ANNOUNCER ON TV
Next up from the Buffalo midday news, we’ll talk to animal control about the recent attacks. But first, the weather!

MANDY walks up to LUCKY, carrying a leash and choke chain.

MANDY
What, am I interrupting the morning show? Come on. Let's go for a walk.

MANDY puts the choke chain around LUCKY’s neck and notices a patch of blood near the top of his left front leg.

MANDY
Hey, is that blood? Have you killed a bird again? Bad dog!


EXT. MANDY’S HOUSE – DAY

MANDY is outside with LUCKY on a leash, talking to a WOMAN and a GIRL. The IMPALA pulls up across the street.

WOMAN
Three o’clock? Does that work?

MANDY
Okay.

WOMAN
Okay.

MANDY
See you later.

WOMAN
See you then.

GIRL
Bye.

MANDY
Bye.

DEAN and SAM in their FBI suits walk across the street towards MANDY.

DEAN
Ma'am.

MANDY
Agents. What are you doing here?

DEAN
Nobody called you?

MANDY
Called me about what?


INT. MANDY’S HOUSE – DAY

LUCKY is on a dog bed next to the kitchen table. DEAN, SAM and MANDY are seated at the table.

MANDY
I'm sorry. I just can't believe it.

DEAN
I'm really very sorry.

SAM
Ma'am, I know this isn't the best time, but we'd like you to come with us.

MANDY
Why? You think I have something to do with this? With Cal?

DEAN
Of course not. We just got a few questions – i's and t's, mostly.

MANDY
I, uh... Could we do it later?

SAM
I'm afraid not.

MANDY looks at SAM, who stares back unmoved.

MANDY
Oh. Uh – uh, my kid has the flu, um, and he was up all night, so –

SAM
Well, is there a neighbor or a friend who can watch him while you're gone?

DEAN
I'm sorry. You said your boy was up all night?

MANDY
Uh, yeah.

DEAN
Were you with him all night?

MANDY
Um – uh – well, I had, um, half an hour of sleep, maybe.

DEAN
Can I talk to your son?

MANDY
Why?

SAM
Yeah, what difference does that make, Agent Holt?

DEAN
[to SAM] Trust me. It's important. [to MANDY] Please?


EXT. MANDY’S HOUSE – DAY

DEAN and SAM are walking towards the IMPALA.

DEAN
Well, it wasn't her.

SAM
You don't know that.

DEAN
She's got an alibi.

SAM
She's lying.

DEAN
You heard the kid, dude. She's not lying.

SAM
Fine. She still had time to wolf out, Dean. The last werewolf was in bed, with me, and she wolfed out.

DEAN
Don't make this personal. Look, all I'm saying is that between this and the daylight attacks, something's not adding up.

They reach the IMPALA and stand on opposite sides talking over the car.

DEAN
I'm not just gonna hand her over to Crowley until we figure out what. You understand?

SAM
Okay. Okay. I understand. How 'bout you go check out Cal's crime scene, see if we're missing anything. I'll come back and keep an eye on Amanda.

DEAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, how 'bout you go and I'll stay here?

SAM
Dean, I still know how to do my job. I'm just gonna watch her. That's all. Trust me.

SAM gets into the car.

DEAN
Uh-huh.


EXT. PARK ACROSS FROM MANDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

SAM is leaning against playground equipment, watching the house. He sees LUCKY’s head through a window. LUCKY lowers his head and disappears from sight. A naked MAN (“LUCKY (MAN)”) straightens up in the spot where LUCKY was and stretches. SAM grabs binoculars. LUCKY (MAN) walks out of the room. SAM cocks his gun. LUCKY (MAN) reappears, wearing clothes. He leaves the house and crosses the street to the park. LUCKY (MAN) stops, sniffs the air and looks around before continuing across the park. SAM watches from behind a wall. LUCKY (MAN) swings himself over a fence as SAM points his gun at him. LUCKY (MAN) walks up to a large MAN who was waiting under a tree. SAM lowers his gun. The other MAN gesticulates forcefully with an arm as he speaks to LUCKY (MAN), then walks away. SAM raises his gun again as LUCKY (MAN) walks slowly back across the park. LUCKY (MAN) stops to sniff the air again and looks in SAM’s direction. SAM flattens himself against the wall and stays still. LUCKY (MAN) takes off running across the park and SAM follows. LUCKY (MAN) swings over a fence at the far side of the park, then reaches for his jacket. We then see LUCKY (in dog form) running along a path. SAM stops to pick up and then drop LUCKY (MAN)’s clothes before continuing the chase. The picture changes to black and white, then back to color, then again to black and white as LUCKY runs towards a street. A station wagon brakes hard and stops.

SAM pauses, gun drawn, near the street and hears the people from the station wagon.

MAN
It’s okay.

WOMAN
It’s okay.

The MAN lifts LUCKY into the station wagon.

MAN
It’ll be okay, boy.

WOMAN
Oh...

SAM runs towards the street.

MAN
We gotta find a vet.

The MAN gets into the driver’s seat of the station wagon.

WOMAN
Hurry, hurry!

SAM pauses at the edge of the street and puts his gun in the back of his jeans.

SAM
Hey!

SAM runs towards the station wagon, waving his arms.

SAM
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait! Mister! Hey, mister, wait! That's my dog!

The station wagon drives away.

SAM
That's my dog.


ACT THREE
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

DEAN is sitting on the edge of a bed looking at his cell phone. Lisa’s name is highlighted on the phone screen. The other names are Christian, Dave, Don, Gwen and Marc. After a moment, DEAN tosses the phone on a table and goes to the kitchen area. He picks up a cup and the coffee pot. His phone rings and he answers it.

DEAN (on phone)
Hey.

SAM (on phone, V-O)
Hey, man, it's me.

DEAN (on phone)
Well, I got bupkis here.

EXT. PARK – NIGHT

SAM (on phone)
I definitely got something. It ain't a werewolf, for one.

SAM retrieves his bag from next to a garbage can. The scene alternates between SAM in the park and DEAN in the motel room.

DEAN (on phone)
Yeah, what is it?

SAM (on phone)
Skinwalker.

DEAN (on phone)
A skinwalker? As in...

SAM (on phone)
As in, the family dog seriously needs a neuter.

DEAN (on phone)
Wow. I haven't of a skinwalker in years.

DEAN reaches for John’s journal.

DEAN (on phone)
I'm actually a little rusty on the profile.

SAM (on phone)
You and me both. Uh, I just got the low down from Bobby. They can change anywhere, anytime. Skinwalkers infect you with a single bite. Otherwise, they're basically a werewolf cousin – silver will drop 'em, they chow hearts like sausages.

DEAN (on phone)
So what happened? Did you catch him?

SAM (on phone)
Not exactly. But I have some idea where he might be.


EXT. ERIE COUNTY DOMESTIC ANIMAL HOSPITAL – DAY

The IMPALA is parked outside.


INT. ERIE COUNTY DOMESTIC ANIMAL HOSPITAL – DAY

DEAN and SAM walk into a room containing dogs in cages. One of the dogs is LUCKY. The picture changes to black and white as we see DEAN and SAM through LUCKY’s eyes.

DEAN
Hiya, Lucky. Bad dog.

The picture returns to color as DEAN crouches down in front of LUCKY’s cage.

DEAN
First things first.

DEAN holds up his gun. The picture changes to black and white as he takes out the magazine.

DEAN
You see this? This is silver. Don't say I didn't warn you.

DEAN puts the magazine clip back in the gun.

DEAN
Okay, time to go. Now, we can either do this the easy way –

DEAN holds up a pair of jeans.

DEAN
Hmm?

DEAN holds up a chain.

DEAN
Or the hard way.

SAM laughs.

SAM
What? Soul or not, that's funny.

LUCKY barks.


INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

LUCKY (MAN) is tied to a chair with a rope reinforced with chain. SAM sits on another chair and DEAN on the edge of a bed.

SAM
Well, I got to tell you, Lucky, you got us stumped. I mean, why shack up with the family? Is it a kinky thing? Do you like to play with your food? Roll over, Lucky. Speak.

LUCKY (MAN)
Go to hell.

SAM
Already been. Didn't agree with me. So, look...

SAM gets up and picks up a knife from the desk.

SAM
...how about I take this silver knife, and start carving some dog until you behave?

LUCKY (MAN)
You do what you got to do.

SAM approaches LUCKY (MAN). DEAN holds up a hand to stop him.

DEAN
Hang on, Sam. [to LUCKY (MAN)] Listen, you don't have to tell me why you're with the family. I get it.

LUCKY (MAN)
Oh, you do, do you?

DEAN
You killed every threat that came near them. You care about them, in your own whack-a-doodle kind of way. It's obvious. What I want to know is, who was that guy you were kibitzing with? He a skinwalker, too?

LUCKY (MAN)
Look, I can't say anything.

DEAN
But if you don't, then you're gonna put the girl and the little boy in danger. And sooner or later, all this crap is gonna come for them. Now, look –

DEAN stands up.

DEAN
We don't give a rat's ass about you. We want to help them. That's our angle. That's it.

LUCKY (MAN)
[after a pause] Yeah, that guy, he's a... whatever it is I am. And he's not the only one.

SAM
How many are you?

LUCKY (MAN)
About 30. We were all -- we were kind of recruited.

SAM
Recruited?

LUCKY (MAN)
Yeah. Me, I was living on the streets. They found me. They told me one small bite, I'd be strong, I'd be fast.

DEAN
Sniffing people's butts? Yeah, that's a real step up.

LUCKY (MAN)
Well, it was for me.

DEAN
Where is this little Scooby gang of yours?

LUCKY (MAN)
Everywhere. We're out there finding families, and once they take us in, we lay low.

DEAN
"Lay low"? What the hell's that mean?

LUCKY (MAN)
Well, we're waiting for the word.

DEAN
What word?

LUCKY (MAN)
Once we're settled, we get the signal... and we all turn on our families. We change them, all in one night. 30 becomes 150.

DEAN
God, you're a sleeper cell.

LUCKY (MAN)
Yeah, well, that's one way to say it.

SAM
So you're waiting for word from who? Who organized you?

LUCKY (MAN)
There's a pack leader.

SAM
Your Alpha?

LUCKY (MAN)
What's an Alpha?

SAM
The – the first skinwalker, the strongest.

LUCKY (MAN)
Well, he's plenty strong, but, no, I – I don't think so. I'm pretty sure there's guys like him in other towns. We're not the only pack out there.

DEAN
Fantastic. Then you can help us stop him.

LUCKY (MAN)
Oh, no, I can't. No.

DEAN
Yes, you can.

LUCKY (MAN)
No, you guys don't get it. No one can. These guys who turned me – they're ruthless.

SAM whistles and holds up a ball, then throws it.

DEAN
Sam, not helping.

LUCKY (MAN)
Fetch this, dick.

DEAN
Listen to me.

DEAN crouches down in front of LUCKY (MAN).

DEAN
What are you gonna do to that family, really? You gonna put your jaws around that little boy's throat? Clamp down, listen to him cry for his mom? 'Cause I'm gonna guess that these are the only people who in your pathetic life have ever showed you any kindness. So it's either that... or you can help us stop it.


EXT. DAY

The IMPALA is parked under a bridge. DEAN is taking things out of the trunk.

SAM
So... How are we supposed to get near something that can smell us a hundred yards off?

DEAN
We don't.

DEAN opens a case of rifles.

SAM
The pack leader. We're taking him down?

DEAN
Yeah. Got a better idea?

SAM
No, I... Crowley's not gonna be too happy about that.

DEAN
Who gives a rat's ass? We let that thing live one second, and it sends out that psychic dog whistle and [hand motions] phew!

SAM
On the other hand, it could lead us to an Alpha. Then Crowley would give me my soul back.

DEAN
Are you kidding? 150 people turned into monsters. That's what you want?

SAM
No. Of course not. I... I'm just asking.

DEAN
All right, you know what? That's it.

SAM
What?

DEAN
You say you're "just folks," yeah? That – that you like baseball and apple pie or whatever. But truth is, I don't know what you are 'cause you're not Sam.

SAM
Dean, come on.

DEAN
I mean, it's your gigantor body and – and maybe your brain, but it's not you. So just... stop pretending. Do us both a favor.

DEAN grabs the rifle case and walks away. SAM picks up a bag, closes the trunk and walks after him.


EXT. BUILDING – DAY

LUCKY (MAN) is waiting outside a building with a large roller door. DEAN is watching through the sights of a rifle from a nearby roof. SAM sits near DEAN and fiddles with silver bullets.

SAM
He looks nervous, right?

DEAN
Wouldn't you be?

SAM
I'd double-cross us. I mean, he's got to realize that's his best bet, if he wants to keep breathing.

DEAN
Nah, he'll go through with it.

SAM
You mean 'cause he loves that family?

DEAN
Yeah.

SAM
I'd double-cross us.

DEAN
Thanks, Dexter. That's reassuring.

SAM
Just making conversation.

A vehicle pulls up.

DEAN
Here we go.

SAM stands up and looks through binoculars. Three men get out of the vehicle. The roller door to the building opens and three more men come out.

SAM
That big guy, the driver – that's the guy Lucky met in the park.

DEAN looks through the rifle sights at a bald man, who is behind another man.

DEAN
And there's El Jefe.

SAM
Take him out.

DEAN
It's not clean. We got one shot at this – literally.

The bald man walks over to LUCKY (MAN), looks at him and shakes his head. Another man escorts MANDY and MANDY’S SON out of the back of the vehicle.

SAM
Take the shot.

DEAN
I'm trying! She's in the way.

SAM
Take it anyway!

DEAN looks at SAM, who looks back.

Through the rifle sights, DEAN watches the bald man put an arm around LUCKY (MAN) and lead him inside. LUCKY (MAN) looks back at MANDY and MANDY’S SON.

DEAN
Come on, come on, come on. Ahh.

With everyone now inside the building, a man closes the roller door. DEAN lowers the rifle.

SAM
So, plan B?

DEAN
We've got one?


ACT FOUR
INT. BUILDING – DAY

MANDY is holding her son in her arms.

MANDY
Please, whatever you want. Just please let my son go.

The bald man whispers to the LARGE MAN next to him. The LARGE MAN walks over to LUCKY (MAN).

LARGE MAN
Look, man, there's nothing I can do. The boss is pissed. These murders that you've been doing? You didn't ask for permission! Now you're gonna screw up the whole damn plan. I tried to warn you.

LUCKY (MAN)
I know. I'm sorry.

MANDY
There – there's been a mistake. T-This has got nothing to do with us.

LARGE MAN
It has everything to do with you, sister.

LUCKY (MAN)
[whispers to LARGE MAN] Hey.

LARGE MAN
So, you with us or not?

LUCKY (MAN)
Yes, of course I am.

LARGE MAN
Fine. Prove it. Turn them. Now. Both of 'em, while we watch, Or I'll kill you all.

MANDY
Oh, my...

The LARGE MAN sniffs.

LARGE MAN
What is that?

SAM steps out from behind a partition and shoots the bald men. MANDY gasps. DEAN shoots with the rifle from some distance away. MANDY takes cover as DEAN and SAM continue to shoot. Two of the men run and SAM chases after them.

MANDY’S SON
Mommy!

MANDY
It's okay.

LUCKY (MAN) crouches down in front of MANDY.

LUCKY (MAN)
Mandy! Come on, come on.

MANDY
Who are you? I don't even know you!

LUCKY (MAN)
Yes, you do. Trust me, I'm trying to help. Come on, come on!

DEAN watches through the rifle sights as LUCKY (MAN) leads MANDY and her son away.

SAM chases after one of the men and shoots repeatedly.

SAM
Dean!

LUCKY (MAN) opens the door to a small room.

LUCKY (MAN)
Get in.

MANDY
But I don't –

LUCKY (MAN)
Get in!

LUCKY (MAN) closes the door behind them.

LUCKY (MAN)
Bolt it! Bolt it!

MANDY locks the door.

The man SAM is hiding behind some equipment.

MANDY pushes her son under a desk.

MANDY
Here, baby, go under here. Okay, stay there, honey. You'll be safe.

MANDY looks through the door’s window at LUCKY (MAN).

SAM discovers a pile of clothes where the man was. He walks past the clothes. A Doberman appears around a corner behind him.

A wolf trots up behind DEAN and snarls. DEAN tries to turn, but his rifle is stuck in a grill. The wolf leaps at him and he fires his handgun. A naked man with a gunshot wound in his back lies face down on the ground.

SAM continues to search the building. The Doberman follows him.

LARGE MAN
[to LUCKY (MAN)] You're protecting them? After what I did for you? I gave you your life back!

DEAN watches through the rifle sights.

LARGE MAN
Them? You're nothing to them. You're a dog.

LUCKY (MAN) punches the LARGE MAN in the face. The LARGE MAN laughs.

LARGE MAN
I-I was gonna turn them. But now I'm gonna kill 'em.

The LARGE MAN punches LUCKY (MAN), sending him flying into the office door and shattering the glass. MANDY screams.

The Doberman growls and runs at SAM, who shoots it as it leaps. A naked man with a gunshot wound in his back lies face down on the ground.

LUCKY (MAN) gets to his feet. He looks back at MANDY. Off camera, he transforms into LUCKY. He barks at the LARGE MAN.

MANDY
Lucky?!

LUCKY continues to bark.

LARGE MAN
So you think this is gonna be a dogfight?

The picture changes to black and white. The LARGE MAN takes out a gun.

LARGE MAN
I got a better idea.

The LARGE MAN shoots. LUCKY yelps. The LARGE MAN advances on LUCKY, who lies on the ground whimpering. DEAN watches through the rifle sights, looking for a clear shot.

LARGE MAN
Silver bullet, Lucky.

DEAN shoots the LARGE MAN, who falls to the ground dead near another of the men who was shot earlier. SAM approaches and looks at LUCKY, who is still lying on the ground. SAM checks his magazine clip and moves around some drums to a better position to shoot. When he raises his gun, LUCKY is gone, with only a pool of blood remaining on the ground. MANDY watches SAM from behind the shattered glass of the office door.


ACT FIVE
EXT. MANDY’S HOUSE – DAY

LUCKY (MAN) knocks at the door. MANDY opens the door and steps back in alarm when she sees who is there.

LUCKY (MAN)
Hi. One…. I'm not here to bother you. I just...Uh, I just want to say one thing. You and Aidan... You're the only family I ever had. And I know – I know that sounds – I know... I know what I am. It... it's just that no one has ever been so nice to me before, so... So, thank you.

MANDY
Get away from this house, you psycho. And if you ever, ever come near me or my son again, so help me...

LUCKY (MAN)
I know I probably deserve...

MANDY closes and locks the door. A few moments later she is visible through the living room window, clenching her fists in agitation. LUCKY (MAN) turns away and there is a noise as he transforms. MANDY looks through the window at the pile of clothes left behind. LUCKY trots slowly down the street, then walks, then stops and looks behind him.


EXT. PARK NEAR RIVER – DAY

A woman jogs past with a dog on a leash. SAM is carrying a bag of take-out food and he and DEAN both hold drinks.

DEAN
I'll never look at a dog the same. Makes you wonder, though, huh?

SAM
What?

They sit at a picnic table near a river.

DEAN
How many packs are out there. What if they're all just waiting for the signal, you know?

SAM
So...I was thinking. You were right.

DEAN
About?

SAM
I'm not your brother. I'm not Sam.

DEAN
Okay.

SAM
Um, all that "Blah, blah, blah," about being the old me? Crap. Like Lisa and Ben, right? I've been acting like I care about them. But I don't. I couldn't care less.

DEAN
Is this supposed to make me feel better?

SAM
You wanted the real me. This is it. I don't care about them. I don't even really care about you. Except that... I need your help. And you're clearly not gonna stick around for much longer unless I give it to you straight, so... I've done a lot worse than you know. I've killed innocent people in the line of duty. But I'm pretty sure it's not something the old me could've done. And maybe I should feel guilty. But I don't.

DEAN
Sam, get to the punch line.

SAM
I don't know if how I am is better or worse. It's different. You get the job done, and nothing really hurts. That's not the worst thing. But I've been thinking. And it was... it was kinda harder. But there are also things about it I remember that I... Let's just say I think I should probably go back to being him.

DEAN
That's very interesting. It's a step.

SAM
So?

DEAN
We do what we got to do. And we get my brother back.
