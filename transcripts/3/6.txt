TEASER
EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

An athletic young woman is out for a run, running along the docks at night. She stops at a water fountain, checks her time, and takes a drink. She hears thunder and looks up, out over the water; sliding past not too far away is a ghostly old sailing ship. She removes her headphones and stares as it crosses into the harbor, then vanishes. She puts her headphones back in, still spooked, and jogs off.

INT. HOME - NIGHT

Later, the same woman is showering. A dark figure approaches and places his hand on the glass of the shower door. She doesn't notice until he rubs at the glass, making a squeaking noise. She pokes her head out and looks around her well-appointed bathroom, but sees nothing. She goes back into the shower; moments later a man in a dry overcoat, who is in the enclosed shower with her, grabs her from behind and begins to strangle her. He slams her against the walls of the shower several times until she slides to the floor, apparently dead.

ACT ONE
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
DEAN is driving, SAM in the passenger's seat. There is a tense silence in the car, which DEAN breaks.

DEAN
So, I've been waiting since Maple Springs. You got something to tell me?

SAM
(playing dumb)
It's not your birthday.

DEAN
No.

SAM
... Happy Purim? (laughs) Dude, I don't know. I have no idea what you're talking about—

DEAN (cutting him off)
There's a bullet missing from the Colt. You want to tell me how that happened? I know it wasn't me. So unless you were shooting at some incredibly evil cans...

SAM
Dean ...

SAM
You went after her, didn’t you? The Crossroads Demon. After I told you not to.

SAM
Yeah, well...

DEAN
You could have gotten yourself killed!
SAM
I didn't.

DEAN
And you shot her.

SAM
She was a smartass!

DEAN (after a beat)
So, what? Does that, does that mean I'm out of my deal?

SAM
Don't you think I might have mentioned that little fact, Dean? No. Someone else holds the contract.

DEAN
Who?

SAM
She wouldn't say.

DEAN
Well, we should find out who. Of course, our best lead would be the Crossroads Demon. Oh, wait a minute...

SAM
That's not funny.

DEAN
No, it's not! It was a stupid freaking risk, and you shouldn't have done it.

SAM
I shouldn't have done it? You're my brother, Dean. And no matter what you do, I'm gonna try and save you. And I'm sure as hell not gonna apologize for it, all right?

DEAN is silent. SAM shakes his head in exasperation.



INT. GERT'S HOME - DAY

SAM and DEAN are impersonating officers of the law to interview a witness. She is holding a framed photograph of the shower-drowning victim. The witness' name is GERTRUDE CASE, an elegant and well-groomed and approximately 70 year old woman. As the scene continues, she begins to flirt shamelessly with SAM.
GERT
But I don't understand. I already went over all this with the other detectives.

DEAN
Right, yes. But, see, we're with the Sheriff's Department, not the police department – different departments.

SAM
So, Mrs. Case...

GERT
Please. (Looking intently at SAM.) Ms. Case.

SAM
Okay. Um, Ms. Case, um... you were the one who found your niece, correct?

GERT
I came home, she was in the shower.

SAM
Drowned?

GERT
So the coroner says. Now, you tell me, how can someone drown in the shower?

SAM
How would you describe Sheila's behavior in the days before her death? I mean, did she seem frightened? Maybe she said something out of the ordinary, or ...?

GERT
Wait a minute. You're working with Alex, aren't you?

DEAN
Yep. Absolutely. That's (laughs) Alex and us, we're like this.

GERT
Why didn't you say so? Alex has been such a comfort. But I’m sorry. I thought the case was solved.

SAM
Uh... Well, no. No, not yet.

GERT
I see.

SAM
So, anyways, we were talking about your niece.
GERT
Well, yes. Sheila mentioned something quite strange before she died. She said she saw a boat.
DEAN
A boat?

GERT
Yes. One minute it was there, then it was gone. It just disappeared right before her eyes. You think it could be a ... ghost ship? Alex thinks it could be a ghost ship. (She is addressing all her comments to SAM, staring at him intently.)

SAM (thrown off by her intense regard)
Well, um ... Could be.

GERT
Well. You let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.
(she traces a finger slowly along SAM'S hand; SAM looks uncomfortable, and DEAN clears his throat, smirking broadly)
Anything at all.



EXT. DOCKS - DAY
DEAN and SAM walk along the docks. The water is crowded with pristine, moderately sized boats.
DEAN
What a crazy old broad.

SAM
Why? Because she believes in ghosts?

DEAN
(laughs) Look at you, sticking up for your girlfriend. You cougar hound.

SAM
Bite me.

DEAN
Hey, not if she bites you first. So, who's this Alex? We got another player in town?

SAM
Maybe, maybe not. Doesn't change our job.

DEAN
And what looked like a ghost ship, right?

SAM
Yeah. It's not the first one sighted around here, either.
DEAN
Really?
SAM
Yeah. Every 37 years, like clockwork, reports of a vanishing three-mast clipper ship out in the bay. And every 37 years, a rash of weirdo, dry-land drownings.

DEAN
So, whatever's happening is just getting started.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
What's the lore?

SAM
Well, there are apparitions of old wrecks sighted all over the world. The S.S. Violet, the Griffin, the Flying Dutchman – almost all of them are death omens.

DEAN
So, what happens? You see the ship and then a few hours later, you pucker up and kiss your ass goodbye?

SAM
Basically.

DEAN
What's the next step?

SAM
I gotta I.D. the boat.

DEAN
That shouldn't be too hard. I mean, how many three-mast clipper ships have wrecked off the coast?

SAM
I checked that too, actually. Over one hundred and fifty.

DEAN
Wow.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
Crap.

SAM
Mm-hmm.


They approach an empty parking space; DEAN looks around, confused.

DEAN
This is where we parked the car, right?

SAM
I thought so.

DEAN
Where's my car?

SAM
Did you feed the meter?

DEAN (voice starting to rise in panic)
Yes, I fed the meter. Sam, where's my car? Somebody stole my CAR!

SAM
Hey, hey, hey! Calm down. Dea—

DEAN
I am calmed down! Somebody stole my ca—
(he begins hyperventilating, bending over to clutch his knees to calm down)

SAM
(after looking around, hears DEAN gasping and runs over to him) Whoa. Dean. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

BELA
(sauntering up)
The '67 Impala? Was that yours?

SAM
Bela.

BELA
I'm sorry. I had that car towed.

DEAN
You what?!

BELA
Well, it was in a tow-away zone.

DEAN
No, it wasn't!

BELA
It was when I finished with it.

DEAN
What the hell are you even doing here?

BELA
(flippantly)
A little yachting.

SAM
You're Alex. You're working with that old lady.

BELA
Gert's a dear old friend.

DEAN
Yeah, right. What's your angle?

BELA
There's no angle. There's a lot of lovely old women like Gert up and down the eastern seaboard. I sell them charms, perform séances so they can commune with their dead cats.

DEAN
And let me guess, it's all a con, none of it's real.

BELA
The comfort I provide them is very real.

SAM
How do you sleep at night?

BELA
On silk sheets, rolling naked in money. (DEAN visualizes, nods slightly.) Really, Sam. I'd expect the attitude from him, but you?

SAM
You shot me!

BELA
I barely grazed you. (SAM looks exasperated, while DEAN shrugs in mute acknowledgement of BELA's point.)
(to DEAN)
Cute. But a bit of a drama queen, yeah?
DEAN
You do know what's going on around here. This ghost-ship thing, it is real.

BELA
I'm aware. Thanks for telling Gert the case wasn't solved, by the way.

DEAN
It isn't.

BELA
She didn't know that. Now the old bag's stopped payment and she's demanding some real answers. Look... just stay out of my way before you cause any more trouble. I'd get to that car if I were you... before they find the arsenal in the trunk. (She turns around.) Ciao.

She leaves.

DEAN
Can I shoot her?

SAM
Not in public.



INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
A man in his thirties is washing his face at the bathroom sink. A dark figure passes behind him, and he turns.

MAN
Hello?
He turns back to finish washing his face. When he turns around again the bathtub is nearly filled with murky water. Confused, he kneels down beside the tub and fiddles with the drain. Suddenly a hand shoots out of the water, grabs him by the neck and strangles him. Veins pop on his forehead and his eyes roll back in his head.


END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXT. HOUSE - DAY

The last victim's house has become a crime scene. BELA, impersonating a reporter, is interviewing a distraught man who is the victim's brother.
MR. WARREN
No. The police said that he drowned, but ... I don't u-understand how...
BELA
I am so sorry for your loss, Mr. Warren. Now, if you could just tell me one more time about the ship your brother saw.

DEAN and SAM approach, wearing suits and flashing badges.

DEAN
Ma'am, I think this man's been through quite enough. You should go.

BELA
But I just have a few more questions.

SAM (firmly)
No, you don't.

BELA (shooting daggers with her eyes at SAM and DEAN)
Thank you for your time.

DEAN
Sorry you had to deal with that. They're like ROACHES (his voice raises so that BELA, walking away, can hear; she turns and looks back at him)

SAM (leading MR. WARREN away)
So, we heard you say your brother saw a ship.

MR. WARREN
Yeah, that's right.

DEAN
Did he tell you what it looked like?

MR. WARREN
It was, uh... like the old Yankee clippers. A smuggling vessel. The rakish topsail, a barkentine rigging. Angel figurehead on the bow.
SAM
That's a lot of detail for a ship your brother saw.

MR. WARREN
My brother and I were night diving. I saw the ship, too.

SAM and DEAN look at each other.

On the other side of the parking lot, BELA is talking to the real uniforms and pointing in DEAN and SAM'S direction. SAM notices first and nudges DEAN. They wrap up.

DEAN
All right. Well, we'll be in touch.

SAM
Thank you.



EXT. WOODS - DAY
DEAN and SAM are loading shotguns at the trunk of the IMPALA. BELA approaches from behind.
BELA
I see you got your car back.

DEAN
You really want to come near me when I got a loaded gun in my hands?

BELA
Now, now. Mind your blood pressure. Why are you even still here? You have enough to I.D. the boat.

SAM
That guy back there saw the ship.

BELA
Yeah? And?

SAM
And, he's going to die, so we have to save him.

BELA
How sweet.

DEAN
You think this is funny?

BELA
He's cannon fodder. He can't be saved in time, and you know it.

DEAN
Yeah, well, see, we have souls, so ... we're gonna try.

BELA
Yeah, well, I'm actually going to find the ship and put an end to this. But you have fun.

About to get in their car, SAM and DEAN pause.

DEAN
Hey, Bela, how'd you get like this, huh? What, did Daddy not give you enough hugs or something?

BELA
I don't know. Your daddy give you enough? Don't you dare look down your nose at me. You're not better than I am.

DEAN
We help people.

BELA
(scoffs) Come on. You do this out of vengeance and obsession. You're a stone's throw from being a serial killer. Whereas I, on the other hand, I get paid to do a job and I do it. So, you tell me – which is healthier?

SAM
Bela, why don't you just leave? We've got work to do.

BELA
Yeah. You're 0 for 2. Bang-up job so far.

She leaves.


EXT. WARREN HOUSE - NIGHT
SAM and DEAN are staking out the home of PETER WARREN (the victim's brother). They're in the IMPALA, and SAM is doing research, reading papers.

DEAN
Anything good?

SAM
No, not really. I mean, both brothers are Duke University grads. No criminal record. I mean, a few speeding tickets. They inherited their father's real estate fortune six years ago.

DEAN
How much?

SAM
$112 million.

DEAN
(whistles)
Nice life.

SAM
Yeah. I mean, nice, clean, aboveboard. So why did they see the ship? Why Sheila, too? What do they all have in common?

DEAN
Maybe nothing.

SAM
No. There's always something.

PETER
(he's spotted them, and has come out of his house toward them, stopping inside his security gate)
Hey, you!

DEAN
I think we've been made.
They get out of the car and approach him.

PETER
What are you guys doing?! You watching me?

SAM
Sir, calm down. Please.

PETER
You guys aren't cops! Not dressed like that. Not – not in that crappy car.

DEAN
Whoa, hey. No need to get nasty.

SAM
We are cops, okay? We're undercover. We're here because we think you're in danger.

PETER
From who?!

SAM
If you just settle down, we'll talk about it.

PETER
Look, you guys just stay away from me!
(He runs to his own car and starts to drive it toward the gate.)

SAM
Wait!

DEAN
Hey, you moron! We're trying to help you!

As PETER's car approaches the gate, the car shudders, coughs, and dies.
DEAN
That can't be good.

SAM
No. Get the salt gun.
DEAN runs back to the IMPALA as SAM dashes to help. Inside PETER's car, a spirit dressed in old seaman's clothes and a navy coat, his long hair dripping into his eyes, appears in the rear seat. PETER turns to look but the spirit is gone; then it re-appears in the front passenger seat. It turns to PETER and glares, then reaches out to touch his cheek. PETER convulses, choking on water that spills out of his mouth and struggling to get a breath. He scrabbles for the door, which locks itself, and he slumps over. SAM arrives at the car.

SAM
Peter!

PETER doesn't respond, but the spirit glares straight at SAM. DEAN arrives on the other side and aims the salt gun at the spirit.

DEAN
Sam!

SAM ducks as DEAN fires. The spirit disappears, and DEAN reaches through the shattered glass to unclock the car doors. SAM yanks the drive-side door open. He pulls Peter back and checks for a pulse, but after a few seconds his shoulders slump and he sighs, shaking his head at DEAN. DEAN kicks the door in frustration.


END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
SAM & DEAN are driving along in the IMPALA with the radio going, talking about the incoming weather.
RADIO
When what started out as a mild (inaudible) severe weather front headed in from the Northwest. Expect heavy lightning and thunder, with sudden rainfall—

DEAN
(Shuts off radio) Do you wanna say it or should I?

SAM
What?

DEAN
You can't save everybody, Sam.

SAM
Yeah, right, so – so what, you feel better now or what?

DEAN
No, not really.

SAM
Me neither.

DEAN
You gotta understa—

SAM (cuts him off)
It’s just lately, I feel like I can't save anybody.

(Eerie music followed by a view of the IMPALA speeding along)



DAYTIME, outside the house SAM & DEAN are staying in.

INTERIOR: SAM is reading, DEAN on his phone.

(A knock at the door)

(DEAN checks the door and sees that it is BELA; SAM & DEAN share a long look before DEAN opens the door.)

BELA
Dear ... God. (SAM sighs.) Are you actually squatting? Charming.
(beat) So how'd things go last night with Peter?

SAM and DEAN don't respond.

BELA
That well, huh?

DEAN
If you say 'I told you so', I swear to God I'll start swinging.

BELA
Look, I think the three of us should have a heart-to-heart.

DEAN
That's assuming that you have a heart.

BELA
Dean, please... I'm sorry about what I said before, okay? I come bearing gifts.

SAM
Such as?

BELA
I've ID'd the ship. (She starts to unzip a portfolio file.)


A SHORT WHILE LATER

BELA
It's the Espírito Santo, a merchant sailing vessel, quite a colorful history. In 1859 a sailor was accused of treason. He was tried aboard ship in a kangaroo court and hanged. He was 37.

SAM
Which would explain the 37 year cycle.

BELA
Aren't you a sharp tack? (beat) There's a photo of him somewhere ... (flipping through file) ... here.

DEAN
Isn't that the customer we saw last night?

BELA
You saw him?

DEAN
Yeah, that's him, except he was missing a hand.

BELA
His right hand?

SAM
How'd you know?

BELA
The sailor's body was cremated, but not before they cut off his hand to make a hand of glory.

DEAN
A hand of glory? I think I got one of those at the end of my Thai massage last week (laughs).

SAM
Dean, the right hand of a hanged man is a serious occult object. It's very powerful.

BELA
So they say.

DEAN
And officially counts as remains.

SAM
But still, none of this explains why the ghost is choosing these victims.

BELA
I'll tell you why. Who cares? Find the hand, burn it, and stop the bloody thing.

DEAN
I don't get it. Why are you telling us all of this?

BELA
Because I know exactly where the hand is.

DEAN
Where?

BELA
At the Sea Pines Museum. It's a macabre bit of maritime history. But I need help.

SAM
What kind of help?

BELA smiles.



EVENING. The house is filled with lit candles. BELA is waiting in the living room of SAM & DEAN's house; no one else is around. BELA is wearing an evening gown with quite a lot of glittery necklace.

BELA
(to DEAN) What is taking so long? Sam's already halfway there... with his date.

DEAN
So not okay with this!

BELA
What are you, a woman? Come down already.

James Bond-ish theme tune as DEAN descends the stairs. BELA sighs in appreciation.

DEAN
All right, get it out – I look ridiculous.

BELA
Not exactly the word I'd use.

DEAN
What?

BELA
You know, when this is over, we should really have angry sex.

DEAN
(beat; shifts uncomfortably) Don't objectify me. (beat) Let’s go.



DEAN and BELA pull into the Sea Pines Museum parking lot in the IMPALA.



Interior. Murmurs from the black tie gathering.

BELA and DEAN walk in, arm in arm. BELA hands an invitation to the doorman.

BELA
Are you chewing gum? (beat) Try to behave as if you've lived this life before, yeah?

DEAN looks around, takes out his gum, and sticks it under the flowing champagne fountain. BELA looks appalled and rolls her eyes. DEAN gives her a thumbs-up and they walk into the gathering.


GERT is handing her invitation to the doorman. Her hair is down, and she walks over to SAM, also in a tux, lacing her arm through his.

GERT
This'll get their tongues wagging, eh, my Adonis?

SAM
(sighs) Just remember, we're on business.

GERT
Ooooh, but sometimes business can be pleasure, hmm? (she slides a hand up his chest seductively)

SAM
Right.
They walk arm-and-arm into the room. GERT runs a hand over SAM's back possessively. SAM chuckles nervously.

SAM
You know, uh, could you excuse me for a moment?

GERT
Of course. (She makes a sort of coochie-coo expression at SAM.)

SAM
Great. Thanks. Thanks. (SAM pats her hand and walks over to BELA and DEAN.) Exactly how long do you expect me to entertain my date?

BELA
As long as it takes.

DEAN
Look, there's security all over this place, all right. This is an uncrashable party without Gert's invitation, so...

SAM
We can crash anything, Dean.

DEAN
Yeah, I know, but this is easier and it's a lot more entertaining.

SAM
You know there are limits to what I'll do, right?

DEAN
Ah, he's playing hard to get, that's cute. Come on. (sighs) I want all the details in the morning!

SAM smiles tightly.

BELA
Thank you.

DEAN and BELA walk off.

SAM adjusts his tuxedo considering his next move. Two glasses of champagne appear before him, followed by GERT's hand, offering him a glass and a toast.

GERT
To us.

SAM looks at the champagne reluctantly than swigs the whole glass. GERT looks excited by his enthusiasm.



SAM and DEAN are walking through to a less crowded room, talking in undertones to each other.

BELA
Private security?

DEAN
I don't think so. Look at the way they're standing. They're pros. Probably state troopers moonlighting.

BELA
Posted to every door, too.

DEAN
Yeah, I don't think we're just going to be able to waltz upstairs.

BELA
What do you suggest?

DEAN
I'm thinking.

BELA
Don't strain yourself. (beat) Interesting how the legend is so much more than the man.

DEAN
You got any bright ideas, I'm all ears.

BELA
Okay. (BELA groans and falls into DEAN's arms toward the floor. DEAN, holding her, kneels down next to her.)

DEAN
Honey? Honey, are you all right? (DEAN looks around, calls a waiter over.) Waiter! Hi. Uh, my wife has a severe shellfish allergy. Th-ere's no crab in that? Is there?

WAITER
No, sir.

DEAN
No? (He takes an appetizer from the silver tray and shoves it in his mouth.) Oh they're excellent, by the way. (talking with his mouth full)

GUARD approaches
What seems to be the trouble?

DEAN
Ah ... champagne! My wife, she's a lightweight when it comes to the sauce. Is there somewhere I can lay her down till she gets her sea legs back?

GUARD (looks around, towards upstairs)
Follow me.

DEAN
Right. (Hands BELA's purse to the GUARD.) Thank you. (DEAN groans as he lifts BELA up) Come on, you lush.



A few moments later, DEAN lays BELA down unceremoniously on a red leather couch.

DEAN (sighs)
(To GUARD) You think she's a pain in the ass now, try living with her. (BELA's eyes pop open.) Thank you very much. (DEAN sees the GUARD to the door, possibly tipping him or just getting BELA's purse back? and shuts it behind him as BELA sits up.)

(To BELA, as he tosses her black bag to her) Hey maybe next time give me a little heads up with your plan?

BELA
I didn't want you thinking. You're not very good at that.

DEAN exhales.

BELA
Oh, look at you. Searching for a witty rejoinder.

DEAN
Screw you.

BELA
Very Oscar Wilde.
Room 235. It's in a locked glass case wired for alarm, I'm sure that won't be a problem.

DEAN
(mumbles mockingly) I'm sure that won't be a problem.

DEAN walks out the door, leaving BELA on the couch looking smug.


(Downstairs. Something almost tango-esque is playing. GERT and SAM are dancing.)

GERT
Where's Alex and your friend? They're missing a great party.

SAM
Umm, ah, I'm sure they’re entertaining themselves.

GERT
Oooh, naughty. Then I guess we'll just have to entertain ourselves as well.

GERT's hand slides down SAM's back and gooses his ass. SAM jumps.

SAM
Whoa, uh … (GERT giggles) Ha, y-you know, Mrs. Case, I— (GERT ooh, ooh, ooh), I'm sorry, Ms. Case ... I don't wanna give you the wrong idea.

GERT
Call me Gert.

SAM
(makes an awkward noise) Okay.

GERT (lays her head on SAM's broad chest)
You remind me of my late husband... He was shy too ... till we got below deck. (offscreen, GERT grabs at SAM'S butt)

SAM
Whoa-oa! Unh....

GERT
Mmmm, you're just firm all over, ooh, mmm. (laughs and moans)

SAM looks freaked out by how rapidly this date is escalating beyond his control.



DEAN is upstairs doing high-tech burglary and retrieving the hand of glory.

We see BELA moving around in a different room, looking at a ship in a bottle.

There's a knocking on BELA's door.

GUARD
Sir? Ma'am? Everything all right?

BELA
(answers the door clutching at her dress, gasping, and smiling as if caught in the act) Hi.

GUARD
Feeling better, I see.

BELA
Yes, much. Thank you.

GUARD
So, if you're done with the room...?

BELA
Well... not exactly. Could we have a few more minutes?

GUARD
Uh.... Yes ma'am.

BELA
(BELA closes the door and giggles loudly: "Stop it! That tickles!")

Walking around the corner he bumps into DEAN, coming from downstairs.

DEAN
Whoa. Sorry! It's, uh ... nature called.

GUARD
Ah huh.

DEAN
Thanks for looking after my wife.

GUARD
Oh, she's ... being looked after, all right.

The GUARD wheels around and walks off with a smile at DEAN's expense. DEAN looks puzzled and then goes to BELA's room.


Opening the door, he sees BELA adjusting her sleeve.

DEAN
Any trouble?

BELA
Nothing I couldn't handle. The hand? (DEAN pulls a wizened human hand out of his pocket. BELA approaches and holds out her own hand.) May I?

DEAN
No. (DEAN pulls it back away from her, then unfolds a handkerchief to wrap it.)

BELA
It might be more inconspicuous in my purse.

DEAN
Nice try.

BELA
Just trying to be helpful.

DEAN
Well, sweetheart, I don't need your kind of help. (DEAN tucks the hand back into his jacket pocket.)


(Downstairs)

GERT is still leaning into SAM's chest, clutching an empty champagne flute. She seems perhaps a bit tipsy.

SAM
Man, this is one long song.

GERT
(Breathes deeply) I hope it never ends. (pause while SAM looks deeply pained) How's the investigation going?

SAM
These things take time.

GERT
People are talking about the Warren brothers’ deaths. Strange. Do you think it’s connected to Shelia's?

SAM
Yeah. Yeah, we think so.

GERT
I think they had it coming, you know. In a Biblical sort of way.

SAM
What do you mean?

GERT
You know about their father?

SAM
No?

GERT
Come here, I'll whisper it to you.

SAM
(as GERT pulls his head down to her mouth) Uh—

GERT
People say that the old man didn't die of natural causes.

SAM (grimacing)
Then how?

GERT (caressing him, as she whispers and blows into his ear)
Rumor is the boys did it. Nothing was ever proved, but, uh, people still whisper.

SAM
Okay, okay, okay. (wincing and pulling away) Um, um, so did, did, did Sheila have any connection to them?

GERT
Well, none that I know of.

SAM
Did Sheila have any kind of tragedy in her life?

GERT
Yes. As a matter of fact there was a ... car accident when she was a teenager.

SAM
What happened?

GERT
Her car flipped over. She was okay but her cousin Brian was killed. Why, is that important?

SAM
Uh...

BELA and DEAN approach.

BELA
Well! Having a nice time?

GERT
He's delightful!
(low, to BELA) He wants me!

BELA
Oh!

DEAN has a look of surprise on his face and SAM looks abashed.

BELA
(whispering to SAM & DEAN) I'm going to get Gert into a cold shower.

SAM
Great idea.

BELA, escorting GERT out the door,
(to SAM & DEAN) See you at the cemetery.

DEAN checks his pocket, then turns to SAM.

DEAN
You stink like sex.



Outside the Sea Pines Museum, in the parking lot. SAM and DEAN are getting into the IMPALA.

SAM
You got it, right? Tell me I didn't get groped all night by Mrs. Havisham for nothing.

DEAN
I got it... Mrs. Who?

SAM
Never mind. Just let me see it.

DEAN pulls something out of his pocket and starts unwrapping it, looking uptight.

SAM
What?

DEAN holds up the ship in the bottle that BELa had been looking at in the office.

DEAN
I'm gonna kill her.



BELA's car. A purse is tossed onto the seat. BELA shuts the door, and looks in the purse at several packets of bills with $10,000 wrappers on them. She pulls one out and flips through it with a satisfied expression on her face, then stares out into space for a moment. In the direction of the ocean. A look of consternation passes over her features.

BELA
Oh, no.

A creaking sound is heard. BELA gets out of her car to look more closely at the ghost ship, which she now sees approaching with thunder and lightning.



END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR
The house SAM & DEAN are squatting in is lit by candles.

DEAN is examining the ship-in-a-bottle by the light of one of the candles.

DEAN
You know what, you’re right. I'm not gonna kill her. I think slow torture's the way to go.

SAM
Dean, look, you gotta relax.

DEAN
Relax! Oh yeah, yeah, I'll relax. I can't believe she got another one over on us!

SAM (looks up)
You.

DEAN
What?

SAM
I...I mean, she got ... one over ... on you, ... not us.

DEAN (pause)
(loudly) Thank you! Sam. Very helpful.

(Rapid knocking at the door)

BELA
Hello? Could you open up? (DEAN opens the door) Just let me explain. (SAM and DEAN look pissed.)



INSIDE, a short while later. BELA is sitting; DEAN is leaning over her, looking like, "I knew it!" SAM is leaning against the mantel, with serious bitchface.

BELA I sold it. I had a buyer lined up as soon as I knew it existed.
DEAN, furious, walks around her and makes a shooting motion with his fingers.

SAM
So the whole reason for us going to the charity ball was...?

BELA
I needed a cover. (SAM nods.) You were convenient.

SAM
Look, you sold it to a buyer. Just go buy it back.

BELA
It's halfway across the ocean. I can't get it back in time.

DEAN
In time for what?

BELA looks down, without answering right away.

SAM
What's going on with you, Bela? You look like you've seen a ghost.

BELA
I saw the ship.

DEAN
You what? (pause) Wow, you know, I – I knew you were an immoral thieving con artist bitch, but just when I thought my opinion of you couldn't get any lower—

BELA
What are you talking about?

SAM
We figured out the spirit’s motive. (He shows BELA a photograph) This is the captain of our ship. The one who hung our ghost boy.

BELA
So?

SAM
So they were brothers. Very Cain and Abel. So now our spirit, he's going after a very specific kind of target – people who've spilled their own family’s blood. (BELA looks stunned.) See first there was Sheila who killed her cousin in the car accident, and the Warren brothers, who murdered their father for the inheritance. And now you.

BELA
Oh my God.

DEAN
So who was it, Bela? Hmm? Who'd you kill? Was it Daddy? Your little sis, maybe?

BELA
It's none of your business.

DEAN
No? Riight. Well, have a nice life – you know, whatever’s left of it. (DEAN slaps her on the back.) Sam, let’s go.

DEAN walks towards the door, picking up his jacket. BELA stands up.

BELA
You can't just leave me here.

DEAN
Watch us.

BELA
Please. (SAM looks down, moved.) I need your help.

DEAN
Our help? Now how could a couple of serial killers possibly help you?

BELA
Okay, that was a bit harsh, I admit it, but it doesn't warrant a death sentence.

SAM
That's not why you’re gonna die. What'd you do, Bela?

BELA
You wouldn't understand. No one did. Never mind. I'll just do what I've always done, I'll deal with it myself.

BELA turns to leave.

DEAN
You do realize you just sold the one thing that could save your life.

BELA (sadly)
I'm aware.

SAM
Well ... (sighs) maybe not the only thing.

DEAN looks at SAM.



Nighttime in the graveyard; full moon.

SAM is setting up a kind of ritual circle: five candles, a pentagram, a bowl into which he pours a jar of red liquid. Another jar is on the opposite side of the circle, with what appear to be herbs in it. SAM places something else into the center of the circle.

BELA (huddling in her jacket)
Do you really think this is going to work?

DEAN (leaning on a tombstone, with a gun across his shoulder)
Almost definitely not.

Thunder crashes; wind whistles; rain starts pouring. SAM zips up his jacket (but inexplicably fails to pull up his hood). DEAN stands up, looking around.

DEAN
Sammy! You better start reading.

SAM
Aziel, Castiel, Lamisniel, Rabam.
Ehrley, et balam, ego vos conuro, per deum verum, per deum vivum (pause) cuivos cuiaves eos supermontes et per eum, qui adam, et avum formovit. Et per eum,
(SAM shouting more Latin)

DEAN (shouting)
Stay close!

BELA
Behind you!

The phantom approaches and throws DEAN through the air. He hits an object with a painful thud, as is his wont. SAM looks up and continues reading Latin. The phantom reaches out to BELA and places his hand on her face.

BELA begins coughing up water. The spirit watches. BELA falls to her knees. DEAN staggers over to her, to help support her through her heaves.

DEAN
Sammy, read faster!

BELA continues to cough. Suddenly the rain dies down. BELA is coughing but it doesn't seem so bad. A creaking sound is heard. The spirit's head slowly turns toward the source of the noise. He sees his brother.

SAILOR'S GHOST
You... hanged me!

SAILOR'S BROTHER
I'm sorry.

SAILOR'S GHOST
Your own brother.

SAILOR'S BROTHER
I'm so sorry!

The GHOST charges his BROTHER'S GHOST, and the two dissolve into screams, and a splash of water.

BELA is no longer coughing water.


END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
Daytime.

SAM & DEAN are packing, getting ready to leave their squatted residency.

The door opens and BELA walks in.

BELA
You boys should learn to lock your doors. Anyone could just barge in.

SAM
Anyone just did. Did you come to say goodbye or thank you?

BELA
I've come to settle affairs. Giving the spirit what he really wanted, his own brother – very clever, Sam. So here. (She tosses them each a packet of money.) It's ten thousand – that should cover it. (The boys look at the packets of money and then at BELA.) I don't like being in anyone’s debt.

DEAN
So ponying up ten grand is easier for you than a simple thank you? (She smiles faintly. DEAN shakes his head.) You're so damaged.

BELA
(her smile broadens) Takes one to know one. Goodbye lads. (she turns around leaves)

SAM
She got style. You gotta give her that.

DEAN
I suppose.

SAM
You know, Dean, we don't know where this money's been.

DEAN
No, but I know where it's going... A-HA HA!



Nighttime. In the IMPALA, SAM is looking at a map, DEAN is driving.

SAM
Seriously? Atlantic City?

DEAN
Hell yeah! Play some roulette. Always bet on black.
(pause)
Hey listen, I've been doing some thinking. Um ... I want you to know I understand why you did it. I understand why you went after the crossroads demon.

SAM sighs.

DEAN
You know, situation was reversed, I guess I'd've done the same thing. (pause) I mean I'm not blind, I see what you're going through with this whole deal, me going away and all that. But you're gonna be okay.

SAM
(looks up at that, exhales, says tonelessly)
You think so.

DEAN
Yeah, you'll keep hunting, y'know, you live your life. You’re stronger than me. You are! (SAM clears his throat) you are... you'll get over it. But I want you to know I'm sorry, I’m sorry for... putting you through all this, I am.

SAM
You know what, Dean? Go screw yourself.

DEAN
What?

SAM
I don't want an apology from you! And by the way, I'm a big boy now, I can take care of myself.

DEAN
Oh, well, excuse me.

SAM (voice raising)
So would you please quit worrying about me? I mean that's the whole problem in the first place. I don't want you to worry about me, Dean, I want you to worry about you! I want you to give a crap that you’re dying!
(DEAN says nothing but smirks annoyingly)
So, that's it? Nothing else to say for you?

DEAN
I think maybe I'll play craps.

SAM stares at him, outraged. Shakes his head. Sighs in exasperation.

DEAN's smile fades.

They drive on.
