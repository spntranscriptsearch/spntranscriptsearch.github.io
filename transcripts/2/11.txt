TEASER
EXT. PIERPONT INN - NIGHT

A slow wind blows, creaking in an ancient sign that reads "Pierpont Inn, Est. 1930". Pan down to a beautiful mansion/hotel and the large van pulling up in front of it.



INT. PIERPONT INN - NIGHT

A large, friendly man follows a young woman (SUSAN) down the dim hallway inside and up a set of stairs.

SUSAN
Most of the stuff is up here.

MAN
I still can't believe you're closing this house. You know my parents got engaged here? My grandparents, too.

SUSAN
Yeah, a lot of people did.
(reaching the top of the stairs)
The boxes are at the end of the hall. Need any help?

MAN
Oh, no ma'am, I've got it.

Two little girls — TYLER and MAGGIE — in old-fashioned schoolgirl outfits are sitting in the railing that overlooks the entryway.

TYLER
He's gonna take our toys?

SUSAN
Only the ones you don't play with anymore. It's not like you don't have enough already.

MAGGIE
(quietly)
Son of a bitch.

TYLER
Son of a bitch.

SUSAN
(to TYLER)
Watch your mouth!

TYLER
Maggie said it first!

SUSAN
(long-suffering)
Watch your mouth too, Maggie.



INT. PLAYROOM - NIGHT

TYLER goes into a large room filled with (rather creepy-ass) dolls and a large dollhouse - an exact replica of the hotel. She begins placing dolls into their beds.

TYLER
Good night, Tabitha.

She looks over, confused, when a doll isn't where she had just placed it. She leans over and sees it lying on the floor of the dollhouse, body facedown but head twisted up. She picks it up slowly. Below, her mother screams.

SUSAN
(on the phone)
Oh god. Yes, yes, are you there? Oh, you have to send someone right now, right now! (babbling) I don't know, he,

On the floor at her feet is the MAN, lying in a pool of blood and contorted like the doll. As TYLER comes to the railing, SUSAN sees her and gasps.

SUSAN
Tyler, don't look! Don't look!

She continues babbling into the phone as TYLER looks down calmly; the man's eyes are staring, his mouth still pulsing in a horrifying gape.

SUPERNATURAL



INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLE: PEORIA, ILLINOIS

Blues music plays on the radio as we pan over the motel room walls; they are covered in maps, hand-written notes, and a MISSING poster showing AVA'S face. The whole scene is eerily reminiscent of JOHN'S middle-of-a-hunt wallpaper.

SAM
(on the phone)
Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Ellen.

DEAN
(entering)
What'd she have to say?

SAM
Oh, she's got nothing. Me, I've been checking every database I can think of — federal, state, and local. No one's heard anything about Ava, she just . . . into thin air, you know?

DEAN
Huh.

He hands over one of the two cups of coffee he's carrying to SAM

SAM
What about you?

DEAN
No, same as before. Sorry, man.

SAM
Ellen did have one thing.

DEAN
Hmm?

SAM
A hotel in Cornwall, Connecticut. Two freak accidents in the past three weeks.

DEAN
Yeah? What's that have to do with Ava?

SAM
It's a job. I mean, a lady drowned in the bathtub; then a few days ago a guy falls down the stairs, head turns a complete one-eighty. Which isn't exactly normal, you know? Look, I don't know, Dean, it might be nothing, but I told Ellen we'd think about checking it out.

DEAN
You did?

SAM
Yeah. You seem surprised.

DEAN
Well yeah, it's just, you know. not the, uh, patented Sam Winchester way, is it?

SAM
(mildly challenging)
What way is that?

DEAN
I just figured after Ava there'd be, uh, you know, more angst and droopy music and staring out the rainy windows, and --
(SAM gives him a look)
yeah, I'll shut up now.

SAM
Look. I'm the one who told her to go back home. Now her fiancé's dead and some demon has taken her off to God knows where. You know? But we've been looking for a month now, and we've got nothing. So I'm not giving up on her, but I'm not going to let other people die either. We've got to save as many people as we can.

DEAN
Wow. That attitude is just way too healthy for me, and I'm officially uncomfortable now. Thank you.

SAM ducks his head and laughs.

DEAN
All right, call Ellen. Tell her we'll take it.



EXT. PIERPONT INN - DAY

It's not raining, but the roads are wet and the air misty as SAM and DEAN park the IMPALA in front of the inn. DEAN gets out of the driver's side.

DEAN
Dude, this is sweet. I never get to work jobs like this.

SAM
Like what?

DEAN
Old school haunted houses, you know? Fog, and secret passageways ... sissy British accents. Might even run into Fred and Daphne while we're inside.
(closing his eyes briefly)
Mmm, Daphne. Love her.

As they go up the steps, SAM notices an urn on the side of the porch.

SAM Hey, wait a sec. He inspects it more closely.

SAM
I'm not so sure haunted's the problem.

DEAN
What do you mean?

SAM
You see this pattern here?
(tapping a five-point symbol engraved in the urn)
That's a quincunx, that's a five-spot.

DEAN
Five-spot.

SAM
Yeah.

DEAN
That's used for hoodoo spellwork, isn't it?

SAM
Right, yeah. You fill this thing with bloodweed and you've got a powerful charm to ward off enemies.

DEAN
Yeah, except I don't see any bloodweed. Don't you think this place is a little too, uh, whitemeat for hoodoo?

SAM (shrugs)
Maybe.



INT. PIERPONT INN - DAY

As they enter, looking around at the quiet interior, SUSAN enters briskly.

SUSAN
May I help you?

DEAN
Hi, yeah, I'd like a room for a couple of nights.

As SAM moves in, TYLER darts in front of his legs, chased by MAGGIE, who runs behind him.

SUSAN
Hey!
(to SAM)
Sorry about that.

SAM
No problem.

SUSAN
Well, um, congratulations, you could be some of our final guests.

DEAN
Well. Sounds vaguely ominous.

SUSAN
No, I'm sorry, I mean we're closing at the end of the month.
(appraising them)
Well, let me guess. You guys are here antiquing?

DEAN
(sharing a "why not?" look with SAM)
How'd you know?

SUSAN
Oh, you just look the type.

DEAN looks vaguely uncomfortable.

SUSAN
So, uh, king-sized bed?

SAM
What? No, uh, no, we're, we're . . . two singles. We're just brothers.

SUSAN
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

DEAN
What'd you mean that we look the type?

SUSAN has trouble articulating an answer.

SAM
You know, speaking of antiques, you have a really, really interesting urn on the front porch. Where did you get that?

SUSAN
Oh, I have no idea, it's been there forever.
(handing DEAN a key)
Here you go, Mr. Mahagov.

DEAN
Thanks.

SUSAN
(dinging the bell)
You'll be staying in room 237. Sherwin, could you show these gentlemen to their rooms?
As she says this, DEAN turns to see an old, balding man in a black blazer shuffling up behind him.

SHERWIN
Let me guess. Antiquers?

SHERWIN drags DEAN'S clunking duffel bag behind him, up the steps, as the brothers follow.

DEAN
I could give you a hand with that bag.

SHERWIN
I got it.

DEAN
Okay.

SAM
So the hotel's closing up, huh?

SHERWIN
Yep. Miss Susan tried to make a go of it, but the guests just don't come like they used to. Still, it's a damn shame.

SAM
Oh yeah?

SHERWIN
It may not look it anymore, but this place was a palace. Two different vice-presidents laid their heads on our pillows. My parents worked here, I practically grew up here. Gonna miss it. Here's your room.

He slips the key in the lock and opens the door, handing the key to SAM as he brushes past. DEAN turns to shut the door and SHERWIN is standing there, hand extended expectantly.

SHERWIN
You're not gonna ... cheap out on me, are you, boy?

DEAN shrugs, looks annoyed as he pulls out his wallet.



LATER

SAM is sitting, sifting through papers, and DEAN is pacing. He chuckles as he approaches what appears to be an antique wedding dress displayed on a wall like a ghost.

DEAN
What the —

SAM
What?

DEAN
That's normal. (gesturing to the dress) Why the hell would anyone stay here? I'm amazed they kept in business this long.

SAM
All right. Victim number one: Joan Edison, forty three years old, a realtor handling the sale of the hotel; and victim number two was Larry Williams, moving some stuff out to Goodwill.

DEAN
Well, there's a connection: they're both tied up in shutting the place down.

SAM
Yeah. Maybe somebody here doesn't want to leave, and they're using hoodoo to fight back.

DEAN
Who do you think our witch doctor is, that Susan lady?

SAM
No, doesn't seem likely. I mean, she is the one selling.

DEAN
So what then, Sherwin?

SAM
I don't know.

DEAN
Of course, the most troubling question is why do these people assume we're gay?

SAM
Well, you are kinda butch. Probably think you're overcompensating.

DEAN
(mocking a laugh)
Right.



INT. HALLWAY - DAY

SAM and DEAN poke around the hallways, SAM sees another urn and picks it up. It too, has a quincunx inscribed.

SAM
Hey. Look at that. More hoodoo.

They approach a door marked "PRIVATE" and DEAN knocks. SUSAN opens the door.

DEAN
Hi there.

SUSAN
Hi. Everything okay with your room?

DEAN and SAM
(talking over each other)
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, everything's great. Yeah.

SUSAN
Well, I was, I was just in the middle of packing.

DEAN
Hey!
(looking past her)
Are those antique dolls? Because this one, (looking at Sam) this one here, he's got a major doll collection back home. Dontcha? Huh?

SAM
(after shooting DEAN a look)
Big time.

DEAN
Big time. You think he could come — or we could come in and take a look?

SUSAN
I don't know ...

DEAN
Please? I mean, he loves them. He's not gonna tell you this, but he's, he's always dressing 'em up in these little tiny outfits and, um, you'd make his day. You — she would, huh? Huh?

SAM (looking sick)
It's true.

SUSAN
Okay. Come on in.

DEAN
All right. All right!

He slaps SAM on the back and follows him in; SAM shoots him a death glare.

DEAN
Wow. This is a lot of dolls. I mean, they're nice, you know. Not super creepy at all.

SUSAN
Yeah, I suppose they are a little creepy. But they've been in the family forever. A lot of sentimental value.

SAM
What is this? The hotel?

SUSAN
Yeah, that's right. Exact replica, custom built.

SAM leans down and picks up the broken doll from earlier. He frowns.

SAM
His head got twisted around. What happened to it?

SUSAN
Tyler, probably.

TYLER runs in.

TYLER
Mommy! Maggie's being mean.

SUSAN
Tyler, tell her I said to be nice, okay?

SAM
Hey Tyler. I see you broke your doll. You want me to fix it?

TYLER
I didn't break it. I found it like that.

SAM
Oh. Well, uh, maybe Maggie did it.

TYLER
No, neither of us did it. Grandma would get mad if we broke 'em.

SUSAN
Tyler, she wouldn't get mad.

DEAN
Grandma?

TYLER
Grandma Rose. These were all her toys.

DEAN
Oh. Really. Where's Grandma Rose now?

TYLER
Up in her room.

SAM
You know, I'd, I'd uh, I'd really love to talk to Rose about her incredible doll —

SUSAN
(suddenly)
No. I mean, I'm afraid that's impossible. My mother's been very sick and she's not taking any visitors.



INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

SAM and DEAN exit the room, talking in hushed voices.

DEAN
Well, what do you think? Dolls, hoodoo, mysterious shut-in grandma?

SAM
Well, dolls are used in all kinds of voodoo and hoodoo, like curses, and binding spells, and ...

DEAN
Yeah, maybe we've found our witch doctor. All right, I'll see what I can go dig up on boomin' Granny. You go get online, check old obits, freak accidents, that sort of thing, see if she's whacked anybody before.

SAM
Right.

DEAN
Don't go surfing porn -- that's not the kind of whacking I mean.

SAM rolls his eyes and turns back to the room as DEAN leaves.



INT. LOBBY - DAY

SUSAN signs a wordy legal document with the word "AGREEMENT" at the top. A weak-chinned LAWYER stands nearby.

SUSAN
I've been meaning to ask. What sort of renovations are you planning?

LAWYER
They never told you?

SUSAN
Told me what?

LAWYER
Uh, Ms. Thompson, we plan on demolishing the hotel.

SUSAN
Oh. I see. Excuse me.



INT. PLAYROOM - NIGHT

TYLER hums to herself over the following as she plays a tea party with several dolls.

In an upper room of the dollhouse, a dark-suited figure sits at the edge of a bed. Upstairs, in the parallel room of the real hotel, the lawyer sits at the edge of his bed.

The door behind doll-lawyer creaks open;
The door behind real-laywer creaks open.

Tyler hums and pours tea. She hears a creak and goes over to the dollhouse.

Doll-lawyer is hanging by the neck from the ceiling fan.
Upstairs, Real-lawyer is hanging from the neck from the ceiling fan, twitching.

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXT. PIERPONT INN - NIGHT

SAM stares through a lace-curtained window as droopy music plays. He watches the coroner cart away the lawyer's body; DEAN is outside, and meets SUSAN as she comes back towards the inn.

DEAN
What happened?

SUSAN
Oh, the maid went in to turn down the sheets and he was just . . . hanging there.

DEAN
That's awful. He was a guest?

SUSAN
He worked for the company that bought the place.

DEAN
Hmm.

SUSAN
I don't understand.

DEAN
What?

SUSAN
Had a lot of bad luck around here. Look, if you'd like to check out I'll give you a full refund.

DEAN
No thanks. I don't scare that easy.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

SAM is sitting alone in the dark, framed by the half-open door with the key askew in the lock. DEAN enters and shuts the door behind him, all business-mode.

DEAN
There's been another one. Some guy just hung himself in his room.

SAM
(darkly)
Yeah. I saw.

DEAN
We've gotta figure this out, and fast. What'd you find out about Granny?

SAM
You're the boss.

DEAN, looking around in surprise
What?

SAM
You're bossy. And short.
(laughs sloppily)

DEAN
Are you drunk?

SAM
Yeah. (laughing) So? Stupid.

DEAN
(he looks around and sees several empty bottles)
Dude, what are you thinking? We're working a case.

SAM
(tearful, staring at nothing)
That guy who hung himself. I couldn't save him.

DEAN
What are you talking about? You didn't know, you couldn't have done anything.

SAM
(shifting his gaze to DEAN)
That's an excuse, Dean. I should have found a way to save him. I should have saved Ava too.

Dean approaches SAM.

DEAN
Yeah, well, you can't save everyone. Even you said that.

SAM
(slamming the table)
No, Dean, you don't understand, all right? The more people I save, the more I can change!

DEAN
Change what?

SAM
(leaning forward, hands to chest)
My destiny, Dean!

DEAN
All right. Time for bed. Come on, Sasquatch.
(He leans over and hauls SAM up by the shoulders.)
Come on.

SAM
I need you to watch out for me.

DEAN
Yeah. I always do.

SAM
No! No, no, no. You have to watch out for me, all right? And if I ever ... turn into something that I'm not ...
(beat)
you have to kill me.

DEAN
(dismissive)
Sam.

SAM
(shoving DEAN to face him)
Dean! Dad told you to do it, you have to.

DEAN
Yeah, well, Dad's an ass.
(SAM frowns in confusion)
He never should have said anything. I mean, you don't do that, you don't, you don't lay that kind of crap on your kids.

SAM
No. He was right to say it! Who knows what I might become? Even now, everyone around me dies!

DEAN
Yeah, well, I'm not dying, okay? And neither are you. Come on. Sam.

He pushes SAM onto the bed, but SAM stays seated, reaching up and clutching DEAN'S jacket. DEAN'S right hand curls in the fabric at SAM'S shoulder.

SAM
No, please! Dean, you're the only one who can do it. Promise.

DEAN
Don't ask that of me.

SAM
Dean, please. You have to promise me.

DEAN
(after a beat)
I promise.

SAM
Thanks.
(he reaches up and grabs DEAN'S face with both hands)
Thank you. You are ...

DEAN
All right. Come on.

He bats SAM'S hands away and shoves him back on the bed. SAM falls back, then turns over on his stomach to plant his face in the pillow, hugging it with both arms. Dean rubs a hand over his face.



INT. DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

Dean goes down to the antique, empty bar. SHERWIN is behind the bar, and DEAN sits down.

SHERWIN
Find any good antiques?

DEAN
(remembering)
Um, no! No, I got distracted.

SHERWIN
Have a drink.

DEAN
Yeah, thanks.
(SHERWIN pours a drink)
So, poor guy, huh? Killing himself?

SHERWIN
That kind of thing seems to be going around lately.

DEAN
Yeah, yeah, I heard about the other ones. It's almost like this hotel is, uh, cursed or something.

SHERWIN
Every hotel has its spilled blood. If people only knew what's gone on in some of those rooms they've checked into.

DEAN
You know a lot about the place, don't you?

SHERWIN
Down to the last nail.

DEAN
I'd love to hear some stories.

SHERWIN
Boy, you should never say that to an old man.



INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT

SHERWIN leads DEAN up the wide staircase, showing him old framed photographs on the walls.

SHERWIN
This is little Miss Susan, and her mother Rose. Happier days.

DEAN
They're not happy now?

SHERWIN
Well, would you be, leaving the only home you ever knew?

DEAN
I don't know. I never really knew one.

SHERWIN
Well, this is Rose's home. It's been in the family over a century. Used to be the family estate. And now she gets to live in some senior living graveyard, and they tear this place down.

DEAN
Yeah, that's too bad.
(they start down the stairs)
I hear Rose isn't feeling well, either.

SHERWIN
No, she isn't.

DEAN
What's wrong with her?

SHERWIN
It's not my business to say.

DEAN
Oh. (nodding)
(he looks at another photo of two little toddlers)
Who's this?

SHERWIN picks up a yellowing photograph of a girl sitting on a chair with young black woman; the woman has a quincunx necklace.

SHERWIN
That's Rose, when she was a little girl.

DEAN
Who's that with her?

SHERWIN
That's her nanny, Marie. She looked after Rose more than her own mother.

DEAN frowns in concern as SHERWIN replaces the photo.



INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

SAM is kneeling miserably in front of the toilet, his hair hanging in his face. DEAN enters and grins at the sight.

DEAN
How you feeling, Sammy? (loudly)
(SAM groans again)
I guess mixing whisky and Jäger wasn't such a gangbuster idea, was it?
(hopefully)
I'll bet you don't remember a thing from last night, do you?
SAM
(groans)
Ohh, I can still taste the tequila.
(DEAN smiles in relief)

DEAN
You know, there's a really good hangover remedy -- it's a, it's a greasy pork sandwich served up in a dirty ashtray.

SAM
(heaving)
Oh, I hate you.

DEAN
I know you do. Hey, turns out when Grandma Rose was a tyke, she had a Creole nanny who wore a hoodoo necklace. Whoo. (at the smell?)

SAM
So you think she taught Rose hoodoo?

DEAN
Yes I do.

SAM
All right.
(standing painfully)
I think it's time we talked to Rose, then.

DEAN
(grimacing)
Oh. You can brush your teeth first.



INT. HALLWAY - DAY

SAM and DEAN approach the door marked "PRIVATE" and knock.

SAM
Hello? Susan?
(DEAN looks around furtively)
Clear?

DEAN
Mm-hmm.

SAM kneels before the door and picks the lock.



INT. PLAYROOM - DAY

SAM and DEAN enter the creepy doll room and go to the door in the back; it's open, and they go through to find a dimly lit staircase. They creep upstairs and to the end of another hallway, into a small room whose door is ajar. ROSE is seated in a wheelchair facing the rainy window, her back to them. They approach cautiously.

SAM
Mrs. Thompson? Mrs. Thompson?
(She is trembling, staring at nothing)
Rose? Hi, Mrs. Thompson, we're not here to hurt you, it's okay —
(she does not respond, just trembles harder)
Rose?
(then, quietly)
Dean.
(drawing DEAN over to the side)
This woman's had a stroke.

DEAN
Yeah, but hoodoo's hands-on, I mean, you've got to mix herbs, and chant, and build an altar.

SAM
Yeah. So it can't be Rose. Hey, maybe it's not even hoodoo.

DEAN
Or she could be faking.

SAM
Yeah, what are you gonna do, poke her with a stick?
(DEAN frowns, nodding)
Dude! You're not gonna poke her with a stick!

SUSAN
(entering)
What the hell?! What are you doing in here?

SAM (overlap)
Oh, we just wanted to talk to Rose . . .

DEAN (overlap)
Well, the door was open . . .

SUSAN
Look at her, she is scared out of her wits. I want you out of my hotel in two minutes or I'm calling the cops.

They leave without hesitation.



EXT. PIERPONT INN - DAY

The IMPALA rumbles out of the hotel parking lot.



INT. BALCONY - DAY

TYLER and MAGGIE are playing jacks.

MAGGIE
Your turn. Eightsies.

SUSAN
Have you started packing yet?

TYLER
No.

SUSAN
Why not?

TYLER
I don't wanna move.

SUSAN
Yes, I know, but we have to.

TYLER
But Maggie says we're not allowed to move.

MAGGIE
Yeah.

SUSAN
Tyler, enough. Maggie is imaginary. You're too old to have an imaginary friend and I am done pretending.

MAGGIE
(sinister)
I don't like her.



END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXT. INN - DAY

SUSAN walks outside and places a box in the trunk of a small red car parked outside. SHERWIN pulls up in a red pickup truck.

SHERWIN
I can lug those boxes for you.

SUSAN
I got it, Sherwin, thanks.

SHERWIN
Okay then. See you later.

He drives off.



INT. PLAYROOM - DAY

TYLER winds up a toy and watches it go back and forth. The miniature swingset beside her starts moving on its own. She stares at it.



EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

A creepy wind blows, and SUSAN stares as the full-sized swingset also begins moving on its own. She approaches the playground cautiously; all the playsets are moving, and the car starts behind her. She lays a hand on the teeter-totter to stop it. Everything starts moving faster, and suddenly the car revs its engine and comes straight at her. At the last moment SAM appears, tackling her out of the way.

SAM
Are you okay?

SUSAN
I think so.

DEAN
Come on, come on. Let's get inside, let's go.

They help her into the inn.



INT. INN - DAY

SAM and DEAN guide SUSAN into the bar and to a table.

SUSAN
Whisky.

SAM
Sure. I know the feeling.

SUSAN
What the hell happened out there?

DEAN
You want the truth?

SUSAN
Of course.

DEAN
Well, at first we thought it was some sort of hoodoo curse, but that out there? That was definitely a spirit.

SAM
(handing her a glass of whisky)
Here.

SUSAN
You're insane.

DEAN
Yeah, it's been said.

SAM
Look, I'm sorry, Susan. We don't exactly have time to ease you into this, but we need to know when your mother had the stroke.

SUSAN
What does that have to do with any—

SAM
Just answer the question.

SUSAN
About a month ago.

SAM
Right before the killings began.
(to DEAN)
See? So what if Rose was working hoodoo, but not to hurt anyone. To protect them.

DEAN
She was using the five spot urns to ward off the spirit.

SAM
Right, until she had a stroke and she couldn't anymore.

SUSAN
I don't believe this.

DEAN
Listen, sister, that car didn't try to run you down by itself, okay? I mean, I guess it did, technically, but, but the spirit can — forget it.

SAM
(interrupting)
Look, believe what you want. But the fact is you and your family are in danger, all right? So you need to clear everybody out of here: your employees, your mother, your daughters, everyone.

SUSAN
Um, I only have one daughter.

SAM
One?

DEAN
I thought Tyler had a sister named Maggie.

SUSAN
Maggie's imaginary.

SAM
Where's Tyler?



INT. ROSE'S ROOM - DAY

MAGGIE is standing in front of a terrified ROSE.

MAGGIE
She's going to stay here with me. And you can't stop me. There's nothing you can do about it.

TYLER
(entering)
Maggie, don't! You're not supposed to bother grandma.

MAGGIE
I know. Come on. Let's play.

TYLER
Can we have a tea party?

MAGGIE
We can have lots of tea parties. Forever and ever and ever.



END ACT THREE


ACT FOUR
INT. PLAYROOM - DAY

SUSAN leads SAM and DEAN up to the playroom.

SUSAN
Tyler!

They go into the room; the floor is littered with broken dolls. Susan starts to panic.

SUSAN
Oh my god. Tyler. (running out of the room) Tyler! (coming back) She's not here!

SAM
Susan. Tell us what you know about Maggie.

SUSAN
Uh, not much. Um, Tyler's been talking about her since Mom got sick.

SAM
Okay, did you ever know anyone by that name?

SUSAN
Uh, no . . .

DEAN
Think, think, I mean, somebody that could have lived here, might have passed away?

SUSAN
Oh my god. My mom. My mom had a sister named Margaret. She barely spoke about her.

SAM
Did Margaret happen to die here when she was a kid?

SUSAN
She drowned in the pool.

DEAN
Come on.



INT. POOL - DAY

MAGGIE and TYLER are hanging on the ledge above the pool.

TYLER
I don't like it up here. I'm scared.

MAGGIE
It's okay. All you have to do is jump.

TYLER
I can't swim.

MAGGIE
I know. But it won't hurt. I promise. And then we can be together -- forever. And no one will bother us.

TYLER
Why don't you just come with me and Mommy?

MAGGIE
Because I can't leave here. And you can't leave me. Please. I don't want to be alone.



EXT. INN - DAY

SUSAN, SAM and DEAN run through the gardens to the pool house. They reach the door and pound on it. It's locked tight, and SAM and DEAN start pounding at the glass to break it.

SUSAN
Tyler!

More pounding.

SUSAN
Tyler!

TYLER
Mommy!

MAGGIE grabs her wrist and pulls her forward; she falls into the pool with a scream.

DEAN
Is there another entrance?

SUSAN
Around back.

DEAN
All right, let's go.
(to SAM)
Keep working.

As they run around the building, SAM continues to pound at the door; he looks back and sees a large potted plant. He pulls the plant out, picks up the heavy pot, and starts pounding the door with it.

Inside, TYLER flounders in the water, coming up for a second; MAGGIE pushes her head down.

DEAN approaches the back door and holds SUSAN aside.

DEAN
Stand back.

He front-kicks the door, twice, but it hardly budges.

DEAN
Son of a bitch!

As MAGGIE holds TYLER'S head under the water, a wavering voice calls her from above.

ROSE
Margaret. Margaret!

SAM finally breaks through the glass and wriggles through the opening. Without hesitation he leaps over the railing and into the pool. He pushes past the plastic covering the pool to reach TYLER, lifting her in his arms. She is unconscious.

DEAN breaks through the back door and he and SUSAN rush in to meet SAM as he exits the pool. After a tense moment, TYLER coughs and wakes up.

SUSAN
Thank god! Thank god, thank god.

TYLER
Mommy!

SUSAN
Yeah, baby, I'm here.

SAM
Tyler, do you see Maggie anywhere?

TYLER
No, she's gone. Mommy.



INT. ROSE'S ROOM - DAY

MAGGIE
You'd really do that for me?
(pause) Yes. If you did, I'd let them go. But I don't understand. You kept me away for so long. I thought you didn't love me anymore.
(beat)
Okay, little sister. (she reaches forward and caresses ROSE's cheek)



INT. HALLWAY - DAY

SUSAN holds TYLER close to her as they go up towards ROSE'S room.

SUSAN
Don't worry, honey, we're leaving in two minutes, we've just got to get Grandma.

DEAN
I don't get it, did Maggie just stop?

SAM
Seems like it.

DEAN
Well, where the hell did she go?

Upstairs, SUSAN screams. They go running up to ROSE'S room to find her slumped in her wheelchair, dead.

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
SUSAN
Paramedics said it was another stroke. Do you think ... Margaret could have had something to do with it?

DEAN
We don't know.

SAM
But it's possible, yeah.
(beat)
Susan, I'm sorry.

SUSAN
You have nothing to apologize for. You've given me everything.
(to TYLER, as she comes out)
Ready to go, kiddo?

TYLER
Yeah.

DEAN
Now Tyler, you're sure Maggie's not around anymore?

TYLER
I'm sure. I'd see her.

DEAN
I guess whatever's going on must be over.

SAM holds the taxi door for SUSAN

SAM
You two take care of yourselves, all right?

Before getting in the taxi, she turns and gives SAM a full-body hug. DEAN smirks.

SUSAN
Thank you. Both of you.

SAM shuts the door behind her.

DEAN
Think you could have hooked up some MILF action there, bud. I'm serious, I think she liked you.

SAM
Yeah, that's all she needs.

DEAN
Well, you saved the mom, you saved the girl. Not a bad day. 'Course you know, I could have saved 'em myself, but I didn't want you to feel useless.

SAM
All right, I appreciate it.

DEAN
Feels good getting back in the saddle, doesn't it?

SAM
Yeah, it does. But it doesn't change what we talked about last night, Dean.

DEAN
We talked about a lot of things last night.

SAM
You know what I mean.

DEAN
You were wasted.

SAM
But you weren't. And you promised.

They get into the car. SAM in a full-on brood, DEAN flicking his eyes towards SAM in worry or anxiety. They pull away from the inn.

Slow pan through the inn to the upstairs bedroom, where MAGGIE and ROSE (now appearing about TYLER'S age) are skipping rope and counting.
