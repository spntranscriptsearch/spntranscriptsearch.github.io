TEASER
GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN

[INTERIOR - OLD HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]

[A woman, NAOKI HIMURA is on ladder, scraping the old wallpaper off of a wall in her house. She is talking on the phone with an earpiece as she does so.]

NAOKI

I'm not mad, honey. I'm just - outnumbered! This place is way more of a fixer-upper than we thought. Like I'm starting to see why it was on the market for so long. No, I know. You're right. That's right. One room at a time. Starting with this awful wallpaper. Thank you. Yeah, love you too. Love you too. 'Kay, bye.

[NAOKI hangs up. She turns back to the wall and scrapes off some more wallpaper, revealing some lines of red paint underneath. A child's scream is heard. NAOKI stops and turns.]

NAOKI

Kat?

[NAOKI runs up the stairs to her daughter's room. KAT is sitting on her bed, terrified.]

NAOKI

Kat?

KAT

Mommy? Something - something bad is in the house.

NAOKI

It's just a nightmare, honey.

KAT

But I heard footsteps. Why did we have to move here? And why is it so cold in my room?

NAOKI

Yeah it is cold in here, huh? But the furnace is going to be fixed tomorrow, so just gotta be patient, okay? We all do. Can I get you anything?

KAT

I'm thirsty.

NAOKI

Okay. One glass of water comin' right up. But then - back to sleep. 'Kay?

[KAT nods.]

NAOKI

'Kay.

[NAOKI leaves. KAT lies down again, when the lights go off all of a sudden. Startled, she sits up. Her door slams shut by itself. A terrified KAT hides underneath her bed, and footsteps can be heard, getting closer and closer on the other side of the door. The shadow of feet are seen near in the light underneath the door.]

KAT

Mama?

[There is no reply as the door opens with a loud creaking. There is no one there. Behind KAT, a gnarly grey hand reaches out, grabs her, and drags her as she screams.]

[TITLE CARD]

ACT ONE
[INTERIOR - CAFE - DAY]

[DEAN is sitting at the bar of a cafe, with a cup of coffee and an untouched burger. SAM comes in and sits down next to him.]

SAM

Alright, nothing on Amara. Nothing on Cas… Keep your head up. We're gonna win this. Remember?

DEAN

Yeah that was before two weeks of squat.

SAM

Yeah well look, nobody said is was gonna be easy. You know the drill, in the meantime, we hunt. Check this out.

[SAM pulls out his iPad with the case information on it.]

SAM

Naoki Himura. Said her little girl was attacked by an entity.

DEAN

Kid's in a coma.

SAM

Yeah. Only site of trauma is what the mom is describing as a handprint from the alleged attacker. But no one else was in the house at the time, so…

DEAN

So vengeful spirit? Poltergeist?

SAM

It's worth finding out. It's only a couple hours away.

DEAN

You really think now is the time to take our eye off the prize?

SAM

Dean we can't just sit around and - and wait for a lead. Plus, it would be nice to get a win, this case seems like a lay-up.

DEAN

(Scoffs) Yeah, when's the last time we had a lay-up?

[INTERIOR - ST. ELIGIUS HOSPITAL - DAY]

[DEAN and SAM, in their FBI suits, are questioning NAOKI at the hospital near the bed where KAT lies, unconscious.]

NAOKI

My wife is flying back, but her flight's been delayed in London, so… (voice breaks) I'm alone in all this.

SAM

Well, we're here to help however we can.

NAOKI

I appreciate that, but why would the FBI have any interest in this?

SAM

Just - doing our due diligence. You know what, why don't you go ahead and tell us about the night of the attack?

NAOKI

Nobody believes there was an attack. Even the internet thinks I'm crazy.

DEAN

Well we don't.

NAOKI

Okay, well… Kat woke up screaming. I thought she was just having a nightmare. But she said she heard footsteps. And that she felt something - bad - in the house.

SAM

Did you also hear footsteps?

NAOKI

No.

SAM

Did you notice anything else? Cold spots, or flickering lights.

NAOKI

Yeah, actually. The lights were out in her room. And it was cold in there. What does that mean?

DEAN

Would you mind if we went and had a look at your house?

NAOKI

Sure, yeah, if you think it's gonna help. There's a hide-a-key under a painted rock by the front door.

SAM

Great. Thank you for your help.

NAOKI

Yeah, sure.

[SAM and DEAN leave as NAOKI approaches KAT. On KAT's leg, which is not covered by blankets, there is a dark bruise in the shape of a handprint.]

[EXTERIOR - NAOKI'S HOUSE - DAY]

[SAM and DEAN arrive in the Impala and start walking up the house's walkway. The next-door neighbor is outside watering her plants.]

NEIGHBOR

Excuse me! Can I help you boys?

SAM

Maybe. Special Agent Rizer.

[SAM and DEAN hold up their FBI badges.]

SAM

This is my partner Special Agent Bean, and we -

NEIGHBOR

Why do the FBI keep coming back to that house?

SAM

Excuse me?

NEIGHBOR

A handful of years ago the FBI came here. I'm the head of the neighborhood watch, you know, so I asked the two agents what they were doing here.

DEAN

And what'd they say?

NEIGHBOR

Not a thing. They were two of the rudest people I'd ever met.

SAM

Huh. By any chance were these agents, um… elder statesmen?

NEIGHBOR

Yeah. Friends of yours?

[SAM and DEAN look at each other, not sure what to say.]

[Cut to EXTERIOR - THE SAME HOUSE - DAY, A HANDFUL OF YEARS AGO]

[BOBBY's car is parked in front of the house in the same place that the Impala is parked in the present. BOBBY is fast asleep in the driver's seat. A truck pulls up and parks behind him. The occupant gets out and opens and slams BOBBY's car door. BOBBY wakes up with a start and draws his gun. The other person is revealed to be RUFUS TURNER.]

RUFUS

Why are you sleeping in your car, Bobby? It's lunchtime.

[BOBBY puts his gun away and gets out of the car.]

BOBBY

What the hell am I doing here?

RUFUS

You're helping me with a case! Like I told you on the phone. You okay?

[They walk toward the house.]

BOBBY

The apocalypse is on the horizon, and you wanna hunt a damn ghost!

RUFUS

Well unless you found a way to stop the end of the world during your little siesta, we got jack all on any of that business. Now I knew you were in the area, heard about this possible little gig, I thought a win would be nice.

BOBBY

Oh wait. I'm supposed to be your friggin' backup?

RUFUS.

Yeah. Well if by backup you mean you do all the heavy lifting while I watch. It's Shabbat!

BOBBY

Are you serious?

RUFUS

Deadly!

BOBBY

You drove over here, ain't that against the rule?

RUFUS

Uh - less talkin', more hunting.

[The same nosy NEIGHBOR stops BOBBY and RUFUS.]

NEIGHBOR

Excuse me! What are you gentlemen here for?

[BOBBY pulls out his FBI badge.]

BOBBY

FBI, ma'am. Special Agent Riggs, my partner Special Agent Murtaugh, we're on official FBI business, nothing to worry about.

NEIGHBOR

Well, I'm in charge of the neighborhood watch here sir, I would like to know what this official business is you're here about.

RUFUS

It's officially none of your damn business, ma'am.

[The NEIGHBOR looks highly offended. BOBBY gives her a weak smile as he follows RUFUS to the front door of the house.]

BOBBY

Were you ever nice?

RUFUS

1985. Worst year of my life.

[RUFUS knocks on the door.]

[INTERIOR - THE HOUSE - DAY, PRESENT]

[DEAN and SAM come in and look around, taking out their EMF detectors. Immediately, both of their detectors start picking things up. They split up, DEAN heading upstairs, SAM going over the ground floor. They meet up again downstairs.]

SAM

I'm getting hits everywhere down here.

DEAN

Yeah, upstairs as well. Alright, so what? Bobby and Rufus worked a case here back in the day?

[SAM looks unsure.]

DEAN

I mean we've had houses with multiple ghosts before.

SAM

I dunno, Dean. I mean the world is small, but it's not that small.

DEAN

I've got a couple of Bobby's old journals in the trunk, why don't we dig into those, dig into the history of the house, see what's what.

[INTERIOR - THE HOUSE, DINING ROOM - DAY, IN THE PAST]

[BOBBY and RUFUS sit at a table with the house's previous owner.]

WOMAN

It was our first night in the house. We had all gone to bed. And then, Will, my son, he called out for help. Said he heard a strange noise, sounded like footsteps. My husband and I ran to his room, but by the time we got there, my baby was on the ground, unconscious.

BOBBY

Did you notice anything else that night, cold spots, or lights flickering?

WOMAN

Actually - yes. Both. Will's room was cold, and the lights were out. The doctors don't know what's wrong with him. Apart from the strange mark on his ankle, there's no sign of trauma.

BOBBY

How do you mean, strange mark?

WOMAN

It looks like a handprint.

[BOBBY and RUFUS exchange glances.]

BOBBY

Well, thank you very much.

RUFUS

Uh, do you know of any affordable motels in the area?

[BOBBY looks at him like he is crazy.]

[EXTERIOR - TRAVEL USA MOTEL - DAY - IN THE PRESENT]

[DEAN leans against the Impala in the parking lot as SAM returns from the motel's office.]

SAM

Get this. Manager said two FBI agents stayed here years ago. So I got the same room. For luck.

[INTERIOR - TRAVEL USA MOTEL ROOM - DAY - IN THE PAST]

[RUFUS is on a bed reading. BOBBY enters.]

BOBBY

Sorry to disturb readin' time, your holiness.

RUFUS

Do not religiously persecute me, Bobby. Tell me something man, why were you sleeping in your car earlier?

BOBBY

Cop's got nothing.

RUFUS

Oh you're really not gonna answer me, huh?

BOBBY

But I got the realtor's report on the house.

RUFUS

'Cause they legally have to tell you who died in the house before you buy it. Look at you being all smart. So who died?

[CUT TO PRESENT]

[DEAN and SAM are in the same motel room, going over their research.]

SAM

There were two deaths at the house, the first was accidental, and don't laugh - a dude choked on a chicken bone. And the other was a murder, a man shot his wife.

DEAN

Well, Bobby and Rufus were definitely on a ghost hunt.

[DEAN hands SAM BOBBY's journal.]

SAM

(Reading) "Grand Rapids, Michigan… possible ghost hunt with jackass." That's all he wrote?

DEAN

Yeah I guess Bobby never got around to finishing it, slacker. Okay, so they were either hunting Chicken Bone, or Ass-Hat. One ghost breaks bad back then, the other's been marinating until now. The only problem I see is that we don't know what bones Bobby and Rufus burned, so we might have to… dig up two graves.

SAM

I dunno, Dean. I think there's more to it than that, I mean, something's not right, it's all a little too easy.

DEAN

Hey, easy like Sunday morning works for me. Okay? We could wrap this up quick, get back to hunting Amara, get Cas back. I mean hey - you said it yourself, this case is supposed to be a lay-up, right?

[DEAN opens the door to leave.]

SAM

Yeah but, as much as I hate to admit it, you were right. You know, I mean when have we ever had one of those?

DEAN

Come on. You think Bobby and Rufus wasted any time arguing about this kind of crap? Let's go!

[EXTERIOR - MOTEL - DAY - IN THE PAST]

[BOBBY and RUFUS leave the motel room.]

BOBBY

Damn it, Rufus, why you always have to make everything so freakin' complicated?

RUFUS

What's complicated? I'm just saying it's not a ghost, it's a baku.

BOBBY

What?

RUFUS

A Japanese mons-

BOBBY

I know what a baku is, you dumbass. We hunted one together in Alaska.

RUFUS

Alright, I'll be you a bottle of Johnny that it's a baku.

BOBBY

Well get ready to buy me a bottle of Johnny, 'cause it ain't a baku, it's a ghost, plain and simple. And the sooner we get to burning bones, the sooner we can get back to figuring out how to save the world! Now come on, we got diggin' to do.

RUFUS

We? We? How many times I gotta tell you man.

[THEY get into BOBBY's car.]

RUFUS

Would it kill you to at least wash this damn thing? It smells like roadkill casserole in here.

BOBBY

Just shut up, ya idjit.

[EXTERIOR - CEMETERY - NIGHT - IN THE PRESENT]

[DEAN opens a casket to find the body inside has already been burned.]

DEAN

Son of a bitch!

SAM

Ashes.

DEAN

(Out of breath) There's gotta be an easier way to dig graves.

[EXTERIOR - CEMETERY - NIGHT - IN THE PAST]

[BOBBY is operating an excavator to dig the grave while RUFUS watches. He stops.]

RUFUS

Why you stopping?

BOBBY

Cause it's your turn. (Hands him a shovel)

RUFUS

What what, my turn? Yo - yo, Bobby. Read my lips, Bobby. I cannot help you. Alright, it is Sabbath.

BOBBY

It is after sundown, so get to diggin'.

RUFUS

(Looking around at the darkness around them) Good catch.

[RUFUS starts digging.]

RUFUS

Bobby can I ask you something?

BOBBY

As long as it's not about why I was sleeping in my car earlier.

RUFUS

Why were you sleeping in your car earlier?

[BOBBY takes a swig from his flask.]

BOBBY

Been burning the midnight oil. Last couple of weeks. Up for days. Lookin' for ways to stop the apocalypse. Lookin' for - anything. Sam and Dean are right in the middle of this thing. I'm worried about my boys, Rufus.

RUFUS

Your boys?

[BOBBY gives him a look.]

RUFUS

Hey, hey. Alright, okay. Papa bear. But you know more than anyone, Bobby. Even if we find a way to keep the world spinning, not everyone's going to be on that bus ride home. Sacrifice, greater good. All that jazz.

BOBBY

Yeah, I know.

RUFUS

Oldest rule of hunting, Bobby. You can't save everyone.

[RUFUS hits wood with the shovel.]

[EXTERIOR - CEMETERY - NIGHT - IN THE PRESENT]

[DEAN and SAM crack open the next grave. The body in this grave has also already been burned.]

DEAN

Oh, COME ON!

SAM

Come on.

[They stare at the ashes in the casket, breathing heavily.]

SAM

Bobby always was thorough.

DEAN

Two ash cans, which means we're not hunting a ghost.

SAM

Told you.

DEAN

Yeah, yeah, yeah. You were right for once.

SAM

So then what the hell are we hunting?

[INTERIOR - THE HOUSE - NIGHT - IN THE PRESENT]

[NAOKI picks up a few of KAT's belongings and goes into the hallway when the lights go out and loud, creaking, footsteps approach her. She falls to the floor and is dragged away just like KAT was.]

ACT TWO
[INTERIOR - HOSPITAL - DAY - IN THE PRESENT]

[NAOKI is unconscious in a hospital bed. DEAN stands nearby, on his phone.]

DEAN

Yeah. Thank you, I appreciate it. Bye.

[SAM comes over.]

SAM and DEAN (simultaneously)

This has happened before.

You first.

SAM

Just - come here.

[He leads DEAN over to a woman.]

SAM

Doctor Richards. This is my partner, Special Agent Rizer. This is Doctor Richards. Now she's retired, but -

DR. RICHARDS

I still have friends on staff here, so when I heard that two family members had lapsed into unexplained comas, I came in to see if I could help.

DEAN

So you were here when this happened before.

DR. RICHARDS

Yes. Two FBI agents spoke to me about that case too.

[INTERIOR - HOSPITAL - DAY - IN THE PAST]

[DR. RICHARDS is in MARY HENDERSON's hospital room talking to BOBBY and RUFUS.]

Dr. RICHARDS

Mary Henderson went home to get her son's favorite doll. When she didn't answer any calls, her husband phoned the police. They found her.

RUFUS

And she's…?

DR. RICHARDS

Same as her son. Weird mark on the ankle, that's it.

BOBBY

So it's…some kind of coma?

DR. RICHARDS

None like I've ever seen.

RUFUS

How do you mean?

DR. RICHARDS

Well, their vitals are fading rapidly. They don't show some signs of rallying soon, I'm worried we may lose them.

[INTERIOR - HOSPITAL - DAY - IN THE PRESENT]

SAM

So, what happened?

DR. RICHARDS

What happened, I have no idea. The next day, mother and son woke up, both perfectly fine. Obviously I hope the same thing happens here, with these two… their vitals are failing as well. So…

SAM

Okay thank you for your time.

[DR. RICHARDS leaves.]

DEAN

So Bobby and Rufus's case.

SAM

It's back, whatever it was. Is. What'd you find?

DEAN

I talked to the local PD, the actual cops that found Mary Henderson back in the day and brought her to this hospital.

SAM

Are the Hendersons still around?

[EXTERIOR - THE HENDERSON HOUSE - DAY - IN THE PRESENT]

[SAM and DEAN pull up in the Impala. MARY HENDERSON is outside in front of her house.]

DEAN

Mary Henderson? Hi, we're Special Agents…

MARY

Oh god. Is it happening again, am I… is my son in danger?

DEAN

No, no, everything's - everything's fine. Um, but we, we would like to talk about what happened to your son.

[INTERIOR - THE HENDERSON HOUSE - DAY - IN THE PRESENT]

MARY

Next thing you know, I woke up in the hospital, and one of the FBI agents told me to never touch the wallpaper in the sitting room.

SAM

Two people are in great danger. Anything you can remember - any little detail…

MARY

I um… when I was in the coma, I had a dream. I mean it was more like a nightmare. It was like I was in the house, but it wasn't the house. Everything was dark. And it looked faded. And at first I was alone, but then I started to see things.

DEAN

What'd you see exactly?

MARY

My husband. He was dead. I closed my eyes and when I opened them, he was gone. I tried to leave the house but I couldn't. And then that's when I started to see them. Spirits, or something, I don't know. Like I said, it's all faded now, it's just - a bad dream.

SAM

And what happened when you woke up?

MARY

Well we - tried to move on. But I couldn't shake the bad feeling, and so we put the house up for sale. Then the market crashed, so finally we just walked on the mortgage. Which is why we now rent and probably will forever. Destroying our credit was worth it, though. Anything to get away from that damn house.

[INTERIOR - THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY - IN THE PRESENT]

[SAM walks into the room where NAOKI had been removing the wallpaper. He looks closely at it and sees the red poking out from underneath.]

SAM

Dean! Check this out. Look at this.

[SAM pulls away more of the wallpaper to reveal a sigil painted on the wall underneath.]

SAM

You recognize that?

DEAN

Vaguely. Looks like they broke the seal when they were redecorating.

[SAM runs his hand over the broken part of the seal.]

DEAN

The hell are we hunting?

[INTERIOR - THE MOTEL - DAY]

[A montage shows BOBBY and RUFUS, and SAM and DEAN eating, drinking, and doing research at the same table in their respective times. When the montage ends, the scene flips back and forth between the two timelines.]

BOBBY

I got it. I think.

[He shows RUFUS a book he was looking at.]

RUFUS

A Soul Eater? What the hell is that?

BOBBY

Undead creature that feeds on souls. Hence the name. They exist in a place between our world and… another. Soul Eater moves into a house, and once it does, it makes what the lore refers to as a nest.

RUFUS

A place that exists outside of time and space.

[IN THE PRESENT]

SAM

The nest looks and feels like whatever house the Soul Eater is in.

DEAN

So Mary didn't have a nightmare when she was in her coma. Remember she said that she was in her house, but it wasn't her house? She was in the nest.

SAM

The Soul Eaters aren't really here or there, but apparently they can muster enough strength to yank their vic's souls out of this world, and into their nest. And then as soon as the vic's in the nest, they're outside of our space and time.

DEAN

Okay, well what about Mary seeing her dead husband and her son?

SAM

Apparently, the nest messes with their victim's head, shows them things they love, parts of their soul in distress, it keeps the victim's soul vulnerable.

DEAN

So what happens to the meat suits in the real world?

[IN THE PAST]

BOBBY

They wither and die in the real world.

RUFUS

Which explains Mary and her son's failing vitals.

BOBBY

And the Soul Eater closes up the nest and moves on to the next house.

RUFUS

What happens to the remains of the souls in the nest?

BOBBY

Well they wither too, but they stay with the Soul Eater, keeping it fed in lean times. Sorta like a cud.

RUFUS

Ew. Well that sounds perfectly awful. We gotta kill this bastard before the Hendersons' bodies wither and die.

BOBBY

According to the lore, they can't be killed. But I'm pretty sure they can be trapped. I think I've faced one of these Soul Eaters before.

RUFUS

You serious?

[IN THE PRESENT]

DEAN

There's a case down in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, Bobby had a call from another hunter, a guy named Harvey. Uh, he was hunting a case, house was rumored to be chock full of poltergeists… but he couldn't find the bones to burn, so he calls Bobby for backup. Bobby high-tails it down there, he goes into the house, buckshots, guns blazin'…

[IN THE PAST]

RUFUS

No no no no no! Do not tell me how you tell it. Tell me how it really happened.

BOBBY

I stepped one foot inside that house, and filled my drawers. You could feel the badness, Rufus. I found Harv on the floor, in a coma, I tried to help, but… he looked like he'd been there for days. And then I heard footsteps. I was trapped. But I had this old Celtic sigil. Sort of a break glass in case of emergencies sort of thing? S'posed to trap monsters, but to be honest, the damn thing never worked before. But it was all I had, so I started. And this house is bad juju, it just got a hell of a lot worse. Then I finished the sigil, and once I did, the house went back to normal.

RUFUS

And um… Harv?

BOBBY

He never did wake up.

RUFUS

Yeah, well. Oldest rule, Bobby. The oldest rule.

[BOBBY nods.]

RUFUS

So um, you actually trapped a Soul Eater?

[IN THE PRESENT]

DEAN

Bobby and Rufus put up their sigil, and trapped the Soul Eater in its nest.

SAM

Right. Yeah, and it stayed there until Naoki accidentally broke the sigil's seal, when she redecorated.

DEAN

Right. Which set the Soul Eater free. Okay but if their sigil only trapped it, then how did Mary and her son's souls get out of the nest?

SAM

Maybe the trap forced their souls out? I don't know. You know, there's gotta be more to this.

[SAM sits down to do more research.]

SAM

You know it's too bad Bobby and Rufus aren't around to see this stuff. They'd have been great Men of Letters.

DEAN

Yeah, grumpy old Men of Letters, but yeah.

SAM

Wait a second. Check this out. Looks like the Men of Letters found a way to kill Soul Eaters.

DEAN

Awesome, how?

SAM

Well it looks like it's another sigil, more complicated, uh… made from blood. You cut your hand and you paint this bad boy inside the house, while the same thing is painted… inside the nest.

DEAN

Which means one of us has to go on there.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

Not it.

SAM

Uh, dude.

[DEAN shrugs. SAM gives him a look, and then holds up his hands for a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.]

[INTERIOR - THE HOUSE - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY]

[DEAN and SAM go into the kitchen.]

DEAN

We are never settling anything with that stupid game again. Ever.

SAM

Alright, I'll paint here, so, you… (walks through the door to the next room) paint yours here. Now, your sigil sets the table, mine actually kills it.

DEAN

Alright, you got your blood?

SAM

Right here. (Holds up a jar of blood)

[They hear footsteps.]

DEAN

Alright let's do this.

SAM

Yup.

[INTERIOR - THE HOUSE - NIGHT - IN THE PAST]

[RUFUS is busy painting the sigil on one of the walls in the house, while BOBBY watches.]

BOBBY

If memory serves, things are about to get hairy.

RUFUS

You wanna hold my hand?

[They hear the floors creaking, and footsteps.]

BOBBY

Keep painting, Picasso.

[BOBBY goes to investigate. He goes upstairs In the present, DEAN also investigates. The lights suddenly go out. DEAN pulls out his flashlight, as does BOBBY in the past. They wander around in the dark as the footsteps get closer.]

DEAN

Come and get me, you son of a bitch!

BOBBY

Stay away from me, you son of a bitch.

[BOBBY turns around and falls to the floor as DEAN does the same in the present. They are both pulled into the nest.]

ACT THREE
[INTERIOR - THE NEST HOUSE - NIGHT]

[DEAN opens his eyes and stands up. He is apparently alone, in the nest that looks exactly like the house.]

DEAN

Sam?

[DEAN walks to a door.]

DEAN

Sam -

[He pushes the door open and on the floor he sees SAM, dead. Startled and unnerved, he closes his eyes for a moment. When he opens them, SAM is gone. He takes a deep breath and tries to reassure himself.]

DEAN

Okay.

[BOBBY also wakes up in the nest, in what looks like the upstairs hallway. He gets to his feet and looks around.]

BOBBY

Rufus?

{BOBBY looks over the banister down the stairs and gasps.]

BOBBY

Oh god!

[DEAN and SAM are at the bottom of the stairs, dead and bloody. BOBBY closes his eyes and gives his head a little shake, and when he looks again, they are gone. He hears a voice behind him.]

WILL

Are you real?

[WILL HENDERSON is standing there.]

BOBBY

Will Henderson?

WILL

Yes, sir. Am I in trouble?

BOBBY

No, no no son, not at all. My name's Bobby Singer, and I'm…I'm here to… well I'm stuck here too. But uh, I'm gonna take care of you, okay? Have you seen your mother?

WILL

No.

BOBBY

Have you seen anyone… strange?

WILL

You mean the sad people?

BOBBY

The who?

WILL

They're right behind you.

[BOBBY turns around, and there are two figures behind him, pale and staring. BOBBY, however, doesn't see them.]

WILL

They look sick. You don't see them?

BOBBY

No. But uh… we're gonna get outta here. My friend's gonna help us.

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PAST]

[RUFUS is at the bottom of the stairs.]

RUFUS

Bobby?

[RUFUS runs up the stairs to find BOBBY unconscious in the hall.]

RUFUS

Bobby? Bobby. Bobby!

[RUFUS hears creaking.]

RUFUS

Oldest damn rule, Bobby. Oldest rule, I'm sorry.

[RUFUS runs back downstairs to finish the sigil.]

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PRESENT]

[SAM drags DEAN's unconscious body into the kitchen and props him up against the refrigerator.]

SAM

I got you! Stay with me. Okay. I'm getting too old for this.

[SAM goes over to the wall and begins to paint the sigil.]

[IN THE NEST]

[On the other side of the wall, DEAN gets to work painting his sigil, when he hears a voice.]

KAT

What are you doing?

DEAN

It's Kat, right?

[KAT nods.]

DEAN

It's nice to meet you, Kat.

KAT

I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

DEAN

And that, that is a solid rule. My name's Dean Winchester. See? Now I'm not a stranger. I'm here to get you out of this place. Have you seen your mom?

KAT

I can't see her. It's too crowded in here now.

[A group of faceless, staring people with darkness around their eyes and mouths are crowded around DEAN and KAT. DEAN, like BOBBY, can't see them.]

DEAN

I don't see anybody.

KAT

You'll see them soon.

DEAN

How 'bout we got you outta here instead?

[KAT nods. Elsewhere, BOBBY walks around the house with Will.]

BOBBY

Your mom's around here somewhere. We look for her, stick together, okay?

WILL

Mommy!

[WILL sees her and runs toward her.]

BOBBY

No, wait, I said stick together!

[All of a sudden, BOBBY notices the others, who have surrounded him, staring. The Soul Eater emerges from among them, and presses its hand against BOBBY's chest. BOBBY falls to the ground.]

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PAST]

[BOBBY's unconscious body twitches, and his eyes open, a cloudy white. Downstairs, RUFUS is painting, but hears BOBBY (possessed by the SOUL EATER) come up behind him.]

RUFUS

Bobby?

[RUFUS pulls out his rifle.]

RUFUS

Whoa.

THE SOUL EATER

Shoot me, you kill your friend.

RUFUS

Rock salt. Bobby can handle it.

THE SOUL EATER

Now, now. No need to hurt anyone. Just come along with me. Into the nest.

RUFUS

Why? So you can show me a bunch of messed up stuff in there while my fabulous body rots out here? I don't think I wanna take that ride.

[IN THE NEST]

[DEAN paints his sigil as KAT watches.]

KAT

It's pretty.

DEAN

Thanks.

KAT

I don't like it here.

DEAN

Yeah me neither. And my brother, he's making a painting just like this one, and when he's done, we're outta here. Okay? (To himself) Come on Sam, the table's set, let's do this.

KAT

There's more of them now.

[DEAN looks at her, and then looks behind them. He can now see the group of people crowded around. Just as with BOBBY, the SOUL EATER emerges through them and places its hand on DEAN's chest. DEAN collapses.]

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PRESENT]

[DEAN's body twitches a bit. SAM, busy with painting the sigil, doesn't notice, until THE SOUL EATER, possessing DEAN, is right behind him, eyes clouded over.]

SAM

Dean?

THE SOUL EATER

I can't let you finish that finger painting, boy.

[THE SOUL EATER punches SAM in the face, knocking him to the floor.]

ACT FOUR
[INTERIOR - THE HOUSE, THE KITCHEN - NIGHT - THE PRESENT]

[THE SOUL EATER shoves SAM across the room.]

THE SOUL EATER

Just come with me. Into the nest. I can keep you safe. From The Darkness.

SAM

Dean, please stop. I know you're in there, fight this!

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PAST]

THE SOUL EATER

Rufus. I can't let you trap me.

RUFUS

(Still pointing the rifle at him) Oooh. Then we got a problem then, don't we?

[THE SOUL EATER approaches RUFUS. RUFUS shoots, but it does nothing. THE SOUL EATER punches RUFUS, who fights back.]

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PRESENT]

[THE SOUL EATER and SAM fight brutally. SAM throws the SOUL EATER against the kitchen cabinets, and the SOUL EATER turns around with a knife in his hand.]

SAM

Dean! Stop this!

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PAST]

[THE SOUL EATER and RUFUS continue to fight. RUFUS manages to knock THE SOUL EATER to the floor, giving him enough time to finish the sigil.]

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PRESENT]

THE SOUL EATER

You know your brother wants to go to The Darkness. He needs to go. But I can keep you safe. Both of you. Forever.

[IN THE PAST]

[RUFUS finishes the sigil. It glows.]

[IN THE NEST]

[BOBBY wakes up again. The floor creaks and the building shakes.]

BOBBY

Yeah that can't be good.

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PRESENT]

[THE SOUL EATER and SAM continue fighting. SAM knocks the knife out of the SOUL EATER's hand. SAM rolls the SOUL EATER across the dining room table and onto the floor. Then, SAM grabs a chair and smashes it on top of the SOUL EATER, who doesn't immediately get up. SAM rushes over to the wall to finish painting the sigil. Just as the SOUL EATER gets up and is once more advancing on SAM, SAM connects the last of the lines, finishing the sigil. DEAN goes rigid as THE SOUL EATER dies and leaves his body. When it leaves, DEAN's body falls over.]

[IN THE NEST]

[Dean opens his eyes and gets to his feet. Around him, the people in the nest are starting to disappear. KAT and NAOKI are standing there, watching him.]

KAT

They're leaving.

[DEAN wanders into the hallway. As more people disappear, he looks up the stairs and sees BOBBY standing there, staring at him. As they stare at each other, shocked, BOBBY fades away. Seconds later, DEAN also vanishes.]

[THE REAL WORLD - IN THE PAST]

[BOBBY wakes up on the floor.]

RUFUS

Bobby. Bobby!

[RUFUS helps BOBBY up.]

RUFUS

You okay? What the hell just happened?

[THE REAL WORLD - THE PRESENT]

[DEAN comes to and sits up.]

SAM

Hey, hey. Dean. You good? You good?

[SAM puts his arms around DEAN and holds him, on the floor.]

SAM

I gotcha.

ACT FIVE
[INTERIOR - THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY, IN THE PAST]

[BOBBY is alone in the living room putting up wallpaper over the sigil that RUFUS painted. His cell phone rings.]

BOBBY

Well?

[RUFUS is in the hospital with the Hendersons, who are awake and smiling. The scene flips back and forth between them.]

RUFUS

Well, everybody's awake, and happy.

BOBBY

So what happened? It was a trap spell, we should be trapped too.

RUFUS

It was a baku, Bobby. I killed it while you slept. That'll be one bottle of Johnny, please.

BOBBY

It wasn't a damn -

RUFUS

Trap sigil pushed your souls out. Case closed, you're welcome.

BOBBY

…I don't like it.

RUFUS

Who gives a damn what you like? Take the win!

BOBBY

Yeah, yeah.

RUFUS

You okay, Bobby?

BOBBY

I'm fine.

RUFUS.

Nah. You saw somethin'. In the nest. Didn't you?

[BOBBY is silent.]

RUFUS

What'd you see, Bobby?

BOBBY

My boys. Both of 'em. Both of 'em dead. And I saw… well I don't know what the hell I saw.

RUFUS

Yeah well. Forget the oldest rule, Bobby.

BOBBY

Are you gettin' soft on me, Rufus?

RUFUS

Yeah, soft this.

[RUFUS flips his cell phone shut.]

BOBBY

Idjit.

[INTERIOR - THE HOSPITAL - DAY - IN THE PRESENT]

[NAOKI and KAT are both awake, and NAOKI's wife is there. They look happy.]

NAOKI (on the phone with SAM)

Yeah, I still don't understand what the hell just happened.

SAM

All you need to know is that your house is safe now. Kitchen may need a remodel, though.

NAOKI

Mmm, that's okay, I think we're selling.

[SAM and DEAN are inside the house, walking out the door.]

SAM

Fair enough. Well take care of yourself.

NAOKI

Thank you. For everything.

[They hang up and SAM and DEAN go outside.]

[EXTERIOR - THE HOUSE - DAY - IN THE PAST]

[BOBBY leaves the house and heads to his car. He waves at the nosy neighbor, and gets in the driver's seat. He notices a bottle, with a note attached to it that says, "Fine, you Ass, you win, for now. Enjoy. R." BOBBY laughs. He gets out his journal to write about the case, when his cell phone rings.]

BOBBY

Dean. You boys okay?

DEAN

Yeah we're fine, Bobby, where the hell have you been? I've left three messages.

BOBBY

Well, I was -

DEAN

Look I got a possible lead on Lilith in Maine. But we're on a case in Reno, I texted you the address, so if you're done sitting on your ass…

[BOBBY stares at his phone, dismayed, flips it shut, and tosses it onto the empty seat next to him. He starts the car.]

BOBBY

Idjits.

[He drives away.]

[EXTERIOR - THE HOUSE - DAY - THE PRESENT]

[SAM and DEAN exit the house, waving to the neighbor.]

SAM

Okay. You know, Bobby's journal never mentioned going into the nest, it didn't say anything actually. You think it really was him, or…?

DEAN

I dunno. Maybe it's like - like you said before. That Bobby and Rufus' trap sigil forced their souls outta the nest back then. And that the Soul Eater was just making me see things. However, if Bobby did go into the nest back then - and you said that that the nest exists outside of space and time, then…well theoretically, couldn't he and I have been there at the same time? Right?

SAM

My head hurts.

DEAN

Let's get drunk and not think about this ever again.

SAM

First we gotta stop in Tennessee though, Bobby's old Soul Eater case. He wouldn't want any unfinished business on the books, man.

[DEAN sighs.]

DEAN

Fine. This time, you're going in the nest.

[They get into the car.]

SAM

Hey, you said the Soul Eater made you see things. Plural. So… what else did you see?

DEAN

I saw you. Dead on the floor.

SAM

Hmm.

DEAN

What?

SAM

How messed up are our lives that you seeing a vision of dead me is actually kind of comforting?

DEAN

Yeah.

[DEAN starts the engine, and they drive away, listening to the Allman Brothers on the radio.]
