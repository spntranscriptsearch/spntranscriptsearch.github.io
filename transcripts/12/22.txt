TEASER
(Nighttime at an auto repair shop – there is a dead and bloody body draped over the hood of a truck. Mary Winchester is washing blood off her hands and brass knuckle claws in the shop sink – she leaves the shop and texts the message 'Lester's down. Who's next?' to Ketch.

As she gets into her car, Ketch messages back:

Fred Macrae, ID Kirby Sheffield, WY Jody Mills, SD

ACT ONE
(Sam, Dean and Toni are in the bunker where the power and air supply has been shut down. Dean is shining a flashlight at a locked circuit control panel.

DEAN (slams his fist against the panel in frustration)

All right. The garage?

TONI

Doors are warded and the walls are reinforced steel.

SAM

Okay. Um, you know, maybe we could get out through the air vents.

TONI (scoffing)

You wouldn't get far.

There are choke points in the duct system not even I could squeeze through.

DEAN

I say we kill her. I mean, you heard Ketch.

Said we had about three days of air left. So if we ice her, maybe that buys us an extra day.

TONI

I assure you, Dean, I'm an extraordinarily shallow breather.

DEAN (scoffs)

Yeah, right.

TONI

If we ever get out of here, I am the one who programmed your mother, which means that I am the only one who can undo it.

And since I assume you want Mummy back, you need me.

DEAN

You believe her?

SAM

I don't know.

Look, if she's lying, sure, we take her out. But Mom is still out there, brainwashed. If she's telling the truth, then we do need her.

DEAN

All right, you're so smart, how do we get out of here?

TONI

The only way out is to pull the manual override.

SAM

Is that a thing?

TONI

Oh, it is.

But it's outside the bunker, where we can't reach it.

DEAN

Awesome.

SAM

Wait a second, guys.

We're in a giant vault loaded down with – with occult books and lore.

There's gotta be something somewhere in here – an item or a spell –

some hoodoo that can reverse the lockdown.

(Screen goes black with ‘DAY ONE’ in white writing-Sam, Dean and Toni are sitting around the table reading lore books)

SAM

I think I got something.

“When the Romani people were forced to assimilate in Europe, the, uh, the Roman used a spell, the Abrogation ritual, as an act of rebellion against their persecutors”.

“The Devla turns back complex mechanical processes, resets equipment, machinery.”

DEAN

What's it take?

SAM

Seems like pretty basic ingredients. Nothing we don't already have.

Oh.

TONI

What?

SAM

The mechanisms “must be anointed with the blood of virgins.”

(Dean looks at Toni, raising his eyebrows)

TONI

Not even close.

DEAN

All right, well, then, I guess we keep lookin'.

SAM

Or we fake it.

TONI

Excuse me?

SAM

We fake it.

SAM

I mean, I've read half a dozen purification rituals in the last hour. If we used one of those on – on our blood...

DEAN

Then what? Revirginize it?

SAM

Maybe.

TONI

So we purify the blood, then do the spell.

Two-step, hybrid magic.

(Scene changes to Sam cutting his hand and dripping his blood into a bowl while reciting a spell in Latin. Dean and Toni follow with their blood. As Sam finishes the spell, a white light emanates from the bowl)

SAM

All right, that's step one.

Step two, you're up.

(Toni recites a spell while sprinkling something into the bowl with the blood)

TONI

Fármichi, fármichi, mashuna parra, mashuna parra.

(There’s a rumbling sound and the table starts shaking. Electricity starts cracking and the lights flicker on and off)

SAM

It's working.

It's working!

(The bunker is powering up as Sam, Dean and Toni look around the room in surprise. Then, the bunker powers down)

Toni

No. [ Sighs ]

No.

SAM

What happened?

TONI

Ketch! He knew we'd...

(Exhales sharply)

He must've put some kind of mystical dampener on the bunker's lockdown.

Magic won't work.

(Sam and Dean sigh dejectedly. Screen goes black to “DAY TWO”)

DEAN (unrolling blue prints on the table)

Okay, we have... exhausted brains, so I saw we try brawn.

SAM

How?

DEAN

Walls.

Now the garage, the Crow's Nest, these are all reinforced steel walls, right?

But right here, (pointing to an area on the blue prints) that's nothing but concrete.

And right there, that's an old sewer pipe, goes straight up to the surface...to the override.

SAM

So wait a second. We're just gonna...

DEAN

Straight Shawshank this bitch.

(Scene change to Dean standing in front of a concrete wall with a pick axe. Sam is off to the side. Dean swings the pick axe at the wall and gets hit in the face with debris)

SAM

Goggles?

DEAN

Goggles.

(Sam and Dean are taking alternate strikes at the wall, the pickaxes are making a clattering sound and concrete is flying. After several strikes, they have barely made an impact)

Dean (grunting)

Yeah.

(Both breathing heavily)

SAM (Groans)

Oh, yeah.

(Sam and Dean slowly sit down against the wall, clearly exhausted)

DEAN

We earned a break.

SAM

Yeah.

DEAN

We'll get there.

SAM

No.

No, we won't.

(Sam twists around to look up at where they were hammering. Dean follows)

SAM

We're not gonna hit dirt for three days.

Two if we're lucky.

I know you feel it – the air, it's thin.

(Inhales deeply)

And it's getting thinner.

How did this happen?

DEAN

What part?

SAM

All of it.

DEAN (dejectedly)

Yeah.

You know, it wasn't long ago, I thought we had it made.

We saved the world.

We got Cass back.

We had Mom back.

I mean, it wasn't perfect, but still, we had 'em.

And now...

SAM

Now they're all gone.

And Mom, what they did to her...

(Scoffs)

I just fell for their company line.

(emotionally)

Man, I...

(Inhales deeply, exhales sharply)

I saw what they were doing, and I – and I thought,

Hunters on that scale, working together... how much good we can do.

And once I was in, I... I just followed. 'Cause it was easy.

Easier.

DEAN

Easier than what?

SAM

Easier than leading.

(Dean nods in agreement and both hang their heads. Sam picks up a piece of concrete and tosses it)

SAM

Is this how you pictured it? The end?

DEAN

Oh, you know it's not.

I always thought we'd go out like...

Butch and Sundance style.

(Sam chuckles)

SAM

Yeah.

Blaze of glory.

DEAN

Blaze of glory.

(Dean smirks)

Son of a bitch.

(Dean closes his eyes and smiles)

(Sam, Dean and Toni are in the war room)

TONI

You're lunatics.

This is a colossally stupid idea.

DEAN (Walking into the room)

Yep.

Big, beautiful, (holds up the grenade launcher) and dumb.

I've had this thing for so long.

Been waiting for the perfect moment to use it.

TONI

The explosion could kill us all.

You could bring the whole bloody place crashing down.

DEAN (Chuckles)

Yeah.

SAM (Chuckles)

Yeah.

TONI

You're lunatics.

Action movie-loving, cheeseburger-eating, moronic American lunatics.

(Sam ushers Toni out of the room)

DEAN

Okay, beautiful.

Yippee ki-yay, mother –

(There are several explosions followed by debris falling.

ACT TWO
Sam and Toni are sitting on the floor in the other room, hands over their ears. As the explosions end, Sam turns on a flashlight and goes to find Dean]

SAM

Dean?

(Shouting) Dean!

(Sam stumbles through the debris to the concrete wall-there is a huge hole which is blocked with concrete debris from the explosion)

Dean?

(Sam makes his way back to the war room, struggling to walk as the lack of air is taking its toll. In the war room, just as he collapses to the ground, the bunker begins to power up and air is pumped into the room. A door creaks open and Dean limps in, his knee bloody and torn open)

DEAN (looking at Sam)

Hey, lunatic.

(Scene change to Mary walking up to Jody’s house and knocking on the door)

JODY (surprised)

Mary?

MARY

Hey, Jody.

Uh... (Sighs and smiles)

You got a sec?

JODY

Yeah.

(Mary enters Jody’s house)

(Scene change to Sam, Dean and Toni with the Impala outside the bunker. Dean is handcuffing Toni in the backseat while Sam sifts through cigar box of cell phones)

SAM

Uh, dead.

DEAN

Wait, I got one.

(Cellphone dialing)

DEAN

Garth? Hey.

Oh, man. It's good to hear your voice.

Listen, uh, those Brits I told you about, they've got a hit out on American Hunters.

I'm guessing that goes double for werewolf hunters, so...

No, I don't have time to explain.

(Toni is shifting around in the backseat, clearly annoyed while Sam tries another cell phone)

You and Bess need to get someplace safe.

Okay? All right.

SAM

Hey.

(As Dean end his call with Garth, Sam looks at him, concerned)

Jody.

(Scene changes to night and the Impala pulling up to Jody’s house.)

DEAN

Jody?

SAM

Jody. Alex.

(Sam and Dean walk into Jody’s living room. There is blood on the carpet. Alex stands by Jody as she sits, holding an ice pack to her face)

ALEX

Hey.

SAM

Hey. Where is she?

(Jody points to Mary who is across the room, tied to a chair)

MARY

Hello, boys.

(Scene changes to Alex taking care of Dean’s knee)

JODY

When she clocked me out of the blue, I thought she was a demon.

I had no idea that brainwashing could be so thorough.

DEAN

Jody, she...

(sighs deeply)

I'm so sorry.

JODY

It's not your fault.

Fortunately, Alex came home.

ALEX

All I did was buy you time. You knocked her out.

(Dean grunts and grimaces in pain)

ALEX

I'll get you something for the pain.

DEAN (finishing a drink)

Make it a double.

(Jody walks over to Dean and pats his arm in sympathy. Dean takes her hand)

MARY

Aw.

You wanna play mother to my son?

He's all yours.

JODY

Dean... that's not your mom.

MARY

What's the matter, Dean?

Am I too different from the Mary you know?

(The front door opens)

MARY

Or too much the same?

(The front door closes and Sam walks in with Toni, who is still handcuffed)

SAM

Here she is. Do your thing.

DEAN

All right, you said you could fix her, so fix her.

TONI

I, um...

Well, I –

MARY

She lied.

SAM

What?

TONI

Mary's programming… It's permanent.

DEAN

But you said...

TONI

You were going to kill me.

The Mary that you know, the good Mary, she's hiding behind impenetrable psychic walls.

And I'm afraid these walls...

(Scoffs)

Well, they can't be torn down with grenades.

Your mother can't be saved.

(Mary smirks)

(A gun cocks as Dean approaches Toni)

DEAN

All right, “Lady,” time's up.

We only kept you alive for one reason.

SAM

Hey, guys.

(A cellphone is vibrating on a table-‘Ketch’ is on the screen)

SAM

Listen, uh, Ketch keeps callin' Mom's phone.

MARY

I'll get it.

DEAN

Let it go to voicemail.

DEAN (shoving Toni)

Let's take a nice little short walk to the backyard.

TONI

This is not going to stop.

Soon enough, they'll find out you're alive, and then...

Well, if you want my advice – run.

DEAN

We're not running.

TONI

Well, then, you die.

SAM

Or...

TONI

Or what?

SAM

Or we fight.

(Scene change to several people sitting around Jody’s living room. Jody hands out some beer)

JODY

Feet off the table, Jerry.

DEAN (taking a beer)

Thanks.

(There’s a knock on the door)

JODY

That should be the last one.

(The front door opens and two men walk in)

SAM

Walt. Roy.

WALT

Well, damn.

ROY

We haven't seen you guys since –

DEAN

Since you killed us.

No hard feelings.

SAM

Uh, uh, please, get comfortable.

DEAN (quietly to Sam)

Sure about this?

WALT

You gonna tell us what we're doing here or what?

SAM

Ah. Of course. Yeah.

Um, so my – my brother and I, we – we, um...

(Sighs)

No, you know what?

I called you here because people... um, our people, are being slaughtered.

And we're next.

The British Men of Letters, they came here because they thought they could do our job better than we could.

And they hooked us with their flashy gear and their tech.

Most of you had the good sense to turn 'em down.

I didn't.

They said they wanted the same thing we wanted, you know?

A world free of monsters.

That's not what they really wanted.

They want control.

They want to live in a world where they can sit in some office and decide who gets to live and who gets to die.

And they've killed people.

They've killed innocent people just because they got in the way.

They think the ends justify the means.

But we know better.

We know hunting isn't just about killing.

It's about doing what's right, even when it's hard.

So we go by our gut, right?

(As Sam speaks passionately, then scene pans around the room as the hunters listen)

We play by our own rules, and that scares them.

That's why they want us dead, 'cause we're the one thing they can't control.

ROY

So what do you want from us?

SAM

I want you to follow me.

Take the fight to them.

To hit them before they hit us.

We go in fast and hard and we fight and we beat them down until they give up or until they're dead.

Look, they're well-trained and well-armed.

Some of us might not make it back.

But we will win.

We will take down the bad guys because that's what we do.

They're scared of us.

Yeah. Good.

They should be.

ACT THREE
JODY

You know where we're goin'? (tosses keys to Sam)

SAM

Yep.

JODY

Gear up. We roll out in 10.

SAM (to Dean, reaching out an arm to help him up)

You ready?

DEAN (standing with difficulty)

Ooh.

Oh, no. I'm not goin'.

(Sam looks at him, questioningly)

SAM

What?

DEAN

No, my leg busted up the way it is, I'm no good in a fight.

SAM

I-I'll take a jacked-up Dean Winchester over any 10 other Hunters any day.

DEAN

Yeah.

I saw you. You're ready for this.

You show those sons of bitches who's boss.

SAM

What about you? What are you gonna do?

I'm gonna save Mom.

(Sam nods)

DEAN

Look, if she's in there, if our real Mom is in there somewhere, then I'm gonna try and find her, bring her back.

JODY (to Alex as she walks into the room with a duffle bag)

Okay, Donna's –

ALEX

Waiting for me at a safe house.

I should drive straight there, no stops.

And you'll call me when this is all over.

I got it.

And, Jody –

JODY

I'll be careful. I promise.

ALEX

Not what I was gonna ask.

Kick it in the ass.

(Jody smiles and kisses Alex on the forehead)

DEAN (to Sam)

You got this.

Come here.

(Dean embraces Sam, pats his back)

DEAN

You come back.

SAM

Promise.

DEAN

Bitch.

SAM

Jerk.

DEAN

Yeah.

(Sam walks away and the front door closes)

DEAN (to Toni)

Okay, you got inside my Mom's head once before.

What about me? You get me in?

TONI

You? I... (Sighs)

Perhaps.

But I need my rig.

DEAN

Where is it?

TONI

At the base.

(Dean looks at her skeptically)

TONI

But I suppose with the right materials,

I could cobble something together.

(Dean chuckles)

(Scene changes to the British Men of Letters (BMOL)base. Hunters pictures (Claire, Garth and others) and information are being displayed on a large screen. There are several people sitting around a table)

DR. HESS

Target lists will be distributed shortly.

In Phase Two, there are no restrictions.

Family members, bystanders.

Don't...leave...witnesses.

That will be all.

(Dr. Hess walks out of the room, passing Ketch on the way)

(Scene changes to the Impala and Jody’s sheriff’s truck speeding down the road at night. Then back to the BMOL base. Ketch grabs a woman by the arm, pulling her towards a computer, where she sits)

KETCH

Paige, I need you to pull up the location of one of our assets, and I need you to keep it between us.

PAIGE

Who?

KETCH

Mary Winchester.

(Paige is typing)

PAIGE

She's in... Lebanon, Kansas.

(At the bunker, Dean handcuffs Mary to a chair in the war room)

DEAN (to Toni)

All right, where's the stuff you need?

TONI

Should be in storage, next to the dungeon.

(Toni goes to walk away but Dean grabs her arm)

DEAN

Ah.

Think I'm lettin' you out of my sight?

TONI

Need I remind you that my organization left me to die?

At this point, I'm not on anyone's side but my own.

So I help you try to save your mother, and when the dust clears...

DEAN

What? I let you go?

TONI

I'd like to see my son again.

I'm not asking for a pass.

I'm asking for a head start.

(Toni holds up the handcuffs. Dean sighs, shakes his head and unlock them.

Scene switches to the BMOL base where guards in battle gear are grabbing weapons from an armory while Dr. Hess looks on approvingly, then back to the Dean, Toni and Mary in the bunker.

Toni is attaching electrodes to Mary’s forehead. The handcuffs dangle from one wrist)

TONI

These electrodes sync your Delta waves with Mary's forming a psychic link.

(Dean is sitting across from Mary with similar electrodes on his forehead)

But to enter her psyche will take a certain measure of concentration and skill.

(Toni adjust some knobs on a machine)

And as there's no time to teach you how to reach the necessary therapeutic dream state, I'm banking on this.

(Toni holds up a large syringe and injects the liquid into Mary’s neck)

Hypnotic agents laced with a potent sedative.

MARY

Ah.

TONI

It's enough to knock an elephant on its trunk.

(Mary passes out. As Toni turns towards the table, Dean reaches out and closes the handcuff around the table leg)

TONI (Scoffs)

Really?

DEAN

Little insurance. You understand.

TONI (sarcastically)

This will hurt.

You understand.

(Toni injects Dean in the neck and he quickly passes out.

Dean ‘wakes up’ sitting in a recliner in a living room. He stands up and realizes that his knee is uninjured. He walks around the house into the kitchen from his childhood. He starts to walk up the stairs and he hears a baby cry. He turns toward the living room he just left and now there is a large crib in the room. He walks over and there is a baby in a blue onesie in the crib, making baby sounds)

DEAN

Sam.

(Mary walks over, bends over the crib, cooing at Sam and covering him with a blanket. She smiles at Sam at walks into the kitchen)

MARY

Dean, lunch is ready.

(Young Dean comes into the kitchen, sits at the table and starts eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with the crusts cut off. Mary touches his head)

ADULT DEAN

Mom.

We gotta get out of here, okay?

You need to come with me.

Mom?

Mom.

(Mary continues to move about the kitchen, oblivious to adult Dean)

Mom!

ACT FOUR
(Scene change to Sam, Jody and the other hunters pulling up to the BMOL base and crashing the gate. They exchange gunfire with the armed guards outside the compound.

Inside the bunker, alarms are blaring while Dr. Hess and the others watch the scene outside on the security camera monitors)

DR. HESS

What is happening out there?

PAIGE

Perimeter's breached.

(Outside, Sam shoots a guard by the base door)

DR. HESS

Hunters.

Gentlemen, ladies, you know what to do.

(The fight continues outside, a hunter and another guard are shot)

SAM (to Jody as a guard opens fire with a machine gun)

Get down!

(Back in Dean and Mary’s dream state, Dean walks over to Mary who is standing at the kitchen sink))

DEAN

Look, I know that they messed with your head, okay?

I know it feels better in here.

It feels safer.

But I-I need you to hear me.

(Mary turns towards young Dean at the table)

MARY

I was thinking maybe we should take Sammy to the park later, before Daddy gets home.

Sound good?

DEAN

Mom, look at me.

(Dean grabs Mary’s arm and it’s solid. She hesitates, pulls out of his grasp and walks over to the oven. Dean stares at his hand for a moment and then looks up at Mary, as if realizing something. The oven door squeaks as Mary pulls a pie out of the oven)

DEAN

You're choosing this.

MARY (Singsong)

Your favorite.

YOUNG DEAN

Yes!

MARY

After you eat.

(Mary kneels next to young Dean)

I only want good things for you, Dean. I'll never let anything bad happen to you.

DEAN (watching Mary and young Dean)

I hate you.

(At the BMOL base, the hunters place explosives on the outside of the door while guards stand on the other side, guns ready. There is an explosion and the door is blown open. The hunters throw a canister into the building and smoke starts to fill the hallway. Under the smoke screen the hunters advance into the bunker, exchanging gunshots with the guard.)

SAM

Go, go, go, go, go.

(A hunter and two guards are shot and the hunters, led by Sam and Jodi, continue moving through the bunker)

SAM

Go! Hurry! Hurry!

(Back to Dean and Mary)

DEAN

You lied to me. I was a kid.

(Mary goes back to the sink. She seems like she hears Dean but is pretending not to)

DEAN

You promised you'd keep me safe.

And then you make a deal with Azazel.

Yeah, it saved Dad's life, but I'll tell you something else that happened.

(Voice breaking)

Because on November 2, 1983, old Yellow Eyes came waltzing in to Sammy's room, because of your deal.

(Mary turns abruptly and walks past Dean to Sam’s crib in the living room)

DEAN

You left us.

Alone.

(Baby Sam is cooing)

'Cause Dad was just a shell.

(Dean approaches Mary at the crib)

His perfect wife? Gone.

Our perfect Mom, the perfect family... was gone.

And I... I had to be... more than just a brother.

I had to be a father and I had to be a mother, to keep him safe.

And that wasn't fair. And I couldn't do it.

And you wanna know what that was like?

(Dean walks around Mary to look at her directly and she turns away)

They killed the girl that he loved.

He got possessed by Lucifer.

They tortured him in Hell. And he lost his soul.

His soul.

(View of baby Sam cooing)

All because of you.

All of it was because of you.

(In the MOL bunker, the machines are beeping as Mary and Dean remain in their dream state. Mary has tears running down her face as Toni looks on)

DEAN (in the dream state)

I hate you.

(Deans voice breaks as tears run down his face)

I hate you.

And I love you.

'Cause I can't – I can't help it.

You're my Mom.

And I understand...'cause I have made deals to save the ones I love more than once.

(Mary continues to look away but seems to hear him)

I forgive you.

I forgive you.

For all of it.

Everything.

On the other side of this, we can start over, okay?

You, me, Sam.

We can get it right this time. But I need you to fight.

Right now, I need you to fight.

I need you – I need you to look at me, Mom.

I need you to really look at me and see me.

Mom, I need you to see me.

Please.

(Mary turns around slowly and looks up at Dean, eyes widening)

MARY

Dean?

DEAN

Mom.

(Dean’s head snaps back and we flash back to the MOL bunker and see the electrodes being pulled off his head. Mary is still unconscious and as Dean looks around he sees Toni on the ground, throat slit. He looks up and Ketch is facing him)

DEAN

No.

KETCH

Oh, yes.

(Dean lunges towards Ketch and they begin to fight. Ketch throws Dean against a bookcase and Dean slides across the floor)

(In the BMOL base, the battle continues as Paige and another hunter are killed.

In the MOL bunker, Dean struggles to get up as Ketch walks towards him)

KETCH

Oh, what? Thought you'd get your Mum back?

Sorry, Dean. Not how this ends.

(Dean gets up and Ketch kicks him in the back of his knee)

KETCH

This ends with me ending you.

DEAN (standing up again)

I'm gonna kill you.

KETCH

You won't, but I'd very much enjoy it if you tried.

(Dean and Ketch fight again with Dean ending up on the floor.

At the BMOL base, Sam moves through the bunker and shoots a guard)

KETCH

You want to know what your mother said about you, Dean?

All those long days and even longer nights out on the road, hunting?

Hmm?

(Ketch grabs Dean by the collar and punches him in the face)

KETCH

Absolutely nothing.

(Ketch pulls Dean up from the floor, holding on to his shirt. Dean’s face is bloodied)

KETCH

Ah. This is fun.

(Dean growls and throws Ketch across the room, breaking through a table)

(In the BMOL base, Dr. Hess is running through the hall. She approaches a door and places her hand on a pad alongside it. As it beeps to allow her entry, Jodi grabs her shoulder. Dr. Hess turns around and elbows her in the face. As Jodi stumbles along the wall Sam enters the hall and runs towards Dr. Hess as she enters the other room)

SAM

Hey!

(As the door closes and Sam tries to get in, Walt comes into the hall)

WALT

I got this.

SAM

Yeah.

(In the MOL bunker, Ketch is attacking Dean with a table leg from the broken table. He gets in a few blows and then pushes Dean up against the wall, the table leg pushing across his chest and neck. After several seconds, Dean lunges forward, grabbing the table leg from Ketch and hitting him. Ketch remains with his back to Dean, trying to recover)


DEAN (panting heavily and leaning on a chair)

When you left us alone in the bunker, man, I knew you were psycho, but I didn't think you were stupid.

KETCH (turning towards Dean)

I may be many things...

(Ketch turns towards Dean, pointing a gun at him)

...but I'm not stupid.

(Ketch raises the gun towards Deans head and there is a gunshot. Ketch cries out, drops the gun and grabs his shoulder. As Dean looks past him, Ketch turns around and sees Mary standing there, gun pointed at him)

DEAN

Mom?

KETCH

Mary.

(Ketch drops his gun and falls to his knees. Dean limps past, kicks the gun away and goes to stand next to Mary)

KETCH

I... (grunts)

I knew you were a killer.

You both are.

DEAN

You're right.

(Mary shoots Ketch and he falls over)

(At the BMOL base Dr. Hess is pacing around the room)

DR. HESS (agitated)

Whatever it takes – open a portal.

Just get me the hell out of here.

VOICE OVER COMPUTER MONITOR

I'm afraid we don't have the resources for an extraction at this moment.

(The door to the room bursts open in an explosion. Sam, Jodi and the other hunter run into the room as Dr. Hess reaches for a gun on the table))

SAM

Don't! Don't.

DR. HESS

Listen, Dean –

SAM

It's Sam.

And you must be Hess, I trust.

You're in charge of this whole operation?

Or, uh, what's left of it?

DR. HESS

Sam, you might think it in your best interest to kill me, to end all of this here.

SAM (shrugs)

Mm.

DR. HESS

But shooting me now, severing all ties with the British Men of Letters, at this particular moment, that would be a grievous mistake.

SAM

I doubt it.

DR. HESS (walking slowly to grab a folder off the table)

There are reasons to reconsider.

Things that you don't know.

(Dr. Hess drops the folder in front of Sam. He opens it and sees grainy pictures of Lucifer)

SAM

What are these?

DR. HESS

Lucifer is back.

Yes, Sam. All thanks to your good friend Crowley.

Not that it did him much good.

Crowley's dead.

(Sam looks up in disbelief)

DR. HESS

And the Devil is out looking for his son, following in its mother's footsteps, tracking her and your friend the angel.

If Lucifer gets his hands on that child, they'll be unstoppable.

You can't face that alone. You need us.

VOICE ON COMPUTER MONITOR

Listen to her, boy.

(Sam has several moments of indecision as Jodi and Walk look on)

SAM

Pass.

(Sam shoots the computer monitor)

DR. HESS

You bastard.

(Dr. Hess grabs the gun off the table and aims it at Sam. Jodi shoots her in the head and Dr. Hess slides down the wall, leaving a trail of blood.

As Sam and Jodi drive away, the base explodes)

ACT FIVE
(In the MOL bunker, Dean walks into the room, shaking a pill bottle. Mary is cleaning up from Dean’s fight with Ketch. Ketch lays under a bloodied sheet on the floor)

DEAN

Found some expired prescription painkillers,

so... (chuckles) lucky me.

Mom, you don't have to do that. It's not your job.

MARY

This...

All of this is because of me.

DEAN

It's gonna be okay.

MARY

It's not okay.

(Mary sighs and walks towards Dean)

MARY

Since I've been back,

I know... I've been distant.

Cold, even.

Leaving you, working with them...

I was trying to make things right.

Just from a distance, because... being here with you was too hard.

Seeing what I'd done to you and to Sam, I...

DEAN

Mom, what you did, the deal...everything that's happened since has made us who we are.

And who we are?

We kick ass. We save the world.

MARY

I'm scared. What...

What if he can't forgive me?

(Sam walks into the room)

SAM (emotionally)

Mom.

You don't have to be scared of me.

(Sam walks over and hugs Mary. Dean walks over and places a hand on Sam's shoulder)

DEAN

Glad you're back, man.

(Sam pulls Dean into the hug with Mary)
